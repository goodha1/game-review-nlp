1	 what game can you do that on other than scum? Also jumping off of a cliff and seeing your body skate across the mountain is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Overall this game is hopefully going to pull through its tough few months and flourish into one of the better survival games available currently.Good Luck and Keep ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."
1	 and lag. I've personally experience very little of these problems. My rig isn't all that impressive so they are either playing on a♥♥♥♥♥♥rig or playing with a bad connetion. Either way it's a cheap pick up for a game with an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of potential."

-1	game is absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥spend an hour running around the map to find a weapon like an  m1 or a bolt action sniper for it to take 8 shots in the chest to kill a zombiegame is wank no end game terrible
-1	 should be criminal to release this♥♥♥♥♥♥as it's like selling a car with no engine. I don't understand what the hype was or is. It's just another survival game we have seen before."
-1	They use server providers that are well known for being utter♥♥♥♥♥♥
1	 it is undoubtedly one of the best survival games on Steam.And you can poop or♥♥♥♥♥♥on your enemy's corpse :)"
1	 the game is lacking in some content but it will be added soon enough.P.S pls nerf mechs.. They spot you through walls and shoots you through the ♥♥♥♥ing walls."
-1	"Game is garbage stay on tarkov or dayz just another rip off wish i can get my money back. if you rlooking to run around for 40 min then die to something stupid loose your♥♥♥♥♥♥and do it all over again please buy the game♥♥♥♥♥♥simulator and running simulator.....PS never played dayz but it cant be worse then this rip off had i known its ""early access"" i would of never bought into the gimick."

1	 would♥♥♥♥♥♥on dead player again."
-1	games ♥♥♥♥ing trash. worst dayz clone that ive played. everythings super clunky. robots see you from a mile away and now they got bufffed so thats just great. no items found. loot in 2 places on the map. no cars so its another walking simulator. dont buy yet. maybe the devs will make the game good in the future. i mean its still in early access so theres still hope.
1	 take a♥♥♥♥♥♥on it>Log off10/10 would play again."
1	 I saw the sun going down and coming back up again(IRL)!!! :))■■[Needed fixes]■■-Memory leak-Add AA options■■[Rating]■■At this moment is 7/10."
1	 with that being said this game is more complete than 90% of other early access games released so far. I cannot wait to see what this small team has in store for this game.TLDR: game doesn't run like♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about computers."
-1	 the game is just confusing to anyone who is new.The game requires you to have a ♥♥♥♥ing NASA supercomputer to play without lagging.I can play GTA 5 on max settings with 60+ FPS.I can play PUBG with decent settings with 60+ FPS.But this game I can barely get over 45 FPS when I have the graphics so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I can't even tell the difference between a cow and a tree.Just read the tags to be able to know this isn't good.Early acces + Survival + Open world = Bad"
-1	The pvp is the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its either stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camping or them one shoting you or my favorite then peaking a corner and ♥♥♥♥ing on you cause of the teribble servers and desync and lets not forgot i have a 1060 i7 and 16bg of ram and i had to actually go past low setting just to get a stable 42 fps. and survival based its okay but you progress really fast and not much late game.
-1	A robot killed be because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation made me stand up and it headshot me.
-1	 swallow it and then♥♥♥♥♥♥on it. Wait for it to dry of and then burn it. Easy and simple.22.79$ is a joke. Thats how much i would pay to ♥♥♥♥ both of your parents.Glad i refunded this crap."
1	游戏还可以，优化差，但是还蛮好玩，期待后期，最恶心的是，我刚买只玩了20分钟，然后退游戏，看了1个小时电影发现游戏还挂在这，已经90分钟了，任务管理器里也没找到游戏的进程，我立马结束steam进程，这是开发商的阴谋吗？为了不让我退款

1	"SCUM is everything DayZ wants to be but never will be because Bohemia refuses to use anything but their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in house engines. if you are interested in how SCUM plays imagine DayZ but all the controls make sense. The melee combat doesnt make you want to scream at the top of your lungs and punch your monitor. The metabolism system is incredibly realistic without being overly important to survival. The Zombies dont hit you from 10 feet away or run through doors or walls to get you. SCUM rewards you for being a good survivor by letting you spend ""fame points"" to spawn near your squad or region if you die. I very much look forward to where SCUM goes with future support... it might just be the survival game we have all been waiting for..."
-1	 where most white people are ♥♥♥♥ing nazis irl"
1	  but it is early accsess so dont buy it at 15£ and expect it to be AAA title."
1	Awesome game♥♥♥♥ devolver for ruining it

-1	remove it from early access. game is so incomplete its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. they cant even get their resolution correct. game is an absolute joke
1	Get drunk and fist fight zombies - Check kill other player and♥♥♥♥♥♥on their corps - Check Keep in mind this game is early access. So less Q.Q and more pew pew

-1	My cumputer is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good but still the game keeps crashing every time -_-.I just don't know
-1	absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Insult to release something this busted for anything more than free to play. gtfo
1	You can♥♥♥♥♥♥out candy bars. 10/10 would buy again.
-1	spent 5 hours collecting loads of stuff. got guns. saw one person. killed them. walked over a rock that was to big. died. body was gonesome aspects are far to detailed. vitamin stats? who cares! i dont know that about thease about my IRL body. dosent seem to really be anything to do other than scavange food and♥♥♥♥♥♥in bushes.
1	 dont ♥♥♥♥ with the mechs ;)"
1	Great game. Still laggy as ♥♥♥♥. Looking forward to the updates.
1	solid game 10/10 would take another risky♥♥♥♥♥♥off the side of a building
-1	 u find guns to defend your self and when it comes to the main poin which is pvp which is to fight your opponent that's where the worst part of this game start the oppent is ♥♥♥♥ING TELEPORTING ALLOVER THE PLACE  AND AFTER hard mother♥♥♥♥ing 20 min OF TELEPORTING YOUR OPPONENTS KILLS YOUR WITH THE MAGIC OF TELEPORTATION."
1	F🤤🤤🤤ing love it
1	 you wont encounter them until you get into High loot areas.Its an early access game and all of us kinda know what it means and we all r tired of it. This Games takes EA to a diff. Level. There is content. Maybe as much as in DayZ but with way more Features besides of looting and killing People. For a Price of 17€ (will increase during EA as content will be added) this game is much more then worth it!"
-1	absolute♥♥♥♥♥
1	 cook human meat/animal meat as a source of energy - not to mention the intricate looking menu with you heart rate temperature etc. I reckon this game knows what it’s doing but just hasn’t painted the walls yet. I guarantee it’s gonna be the next big thing though so before those prices volt up you should get yourself a copy. S"
1	NE SE SEKERAT POBJE TO JE SELE ALFA TKO DA SO ZELO DOBRO NAREDILI ZA ZAČETEK !
1	 My friend was thirsty and asked if i had anything to drink and i started to poop right next to the fire and i pooped out a soda can and he was like nahhhh. (you poop out items randomly with the delux pack dlc)- We were running into a mech zone and i had hyperthermia stage 3 and we were running around and i started to vommit in the open and a mech seen me and shot me to 1 hp and i died right infront of my friend.- I finished looting an area and i was walking to my friend to meet with him and i heard a gunshot so i went over to kill them and i seen a bullet fly past my head and i hid behind the rock to see where he was and i seen 2 Bambis with stone weapons and they said that they were friendly and their friend with the gun came over and i was deciding on if i wanted to kill them and then i had explosive diarrhoea and i said ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; then they killed me and took my loot"
1	 so on that note i feal while the game is lacking in content the parts that are in the game are done very well i dont have a ""top-end"" rig however i havent had any of the crashes disconnects or low fps bug that most are complaining about (Early access bugs in my opinion). most of my time has been spent in single player learning the game and how each stat works etc i recommend watching the videos in the steam store page about what they all do.my biggest problem is no dedicated server support!so yes as an early access game in its current state i do think its worth the current price of ~£15"
-1	.Roads but no carswater and no boats...of youve killed a zombie and made a spear and found a gun.. HORRRAY! thats about all you can do...theres nothing much more to do...  craft a fire? perhaps a lean to?this is alpha but its a very POOR one... streamers loot must have been WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY up there... nice bait and switch.... only fun was watching my buddy♥♥♥♥♥♥the couch and pee the bed... back to pubg at least there i know why theres no loot"
1	 it is definitely worth getting.  Joining the journey this game is going to go on is worth £15. Absolutely. No doubt of that. Buy it. You will agree."
1	why devs are such a ♥♥♥♥♥ to remove nazi tatto you morons don't listen to ♥♥♥♥ing  media...
-1	bad game. id rather play dayz when it was in its most buggy state then this game. it seemed so promising but with so much complexity comes mass room for error witch is what this game is full of... errors and bugs its what you'd expect for an early access but worse because most are actualy good. they say they turned up the loot and theres still ♥♥♥♥ing nothing anywhere i played my full 2hrs before i refunded this game and the only gun i found in surplus was the .22 rifle

1	 and I think the same will go for SCUM... only better. Keep listening to the community because we as whole are tired of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games"
1	never seen so much attention to detail with chucking a shιt 10/10
1	 so what to expect?I'll give it a ★★★★★★★☆☆☆"
1	you can♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥.. im happy
1	this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome kicks the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of every survival game on the current market and its only in alpha. DayZ eat your ♥♥♥♥ing heart out this game stomps all over what you tried to do and kicks your♥♥♥♥♥the first week its out over the 6 years you have been in development hell. cant wait to see what the devs bring in the next year hoping vehicles are the first major update.♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥on your friends simulator 100/10
1	I♥♥♥♥♥♥on a guy i killed and but he respawned and killed me while i was in the animation.I regret nothing / 10
1	To be perfectly honest I bought this game after watching some twitch streams and youtube videos. This game has exceeded my expectations in nearly all catagories. Even the horrid desync at launch was fixed within a week to be bareable. Combat isn't perfect but it's still fun. The survival aspect is IMO one of the best systems to date and will only improve. I don't like comparing it to DayZ because DayZ took  years  to add simple♥♥♥♥♥♥this game already covers and more. For $20 it's a no brainer from me to buy especially if the devs continue building onto an already aesthetically pleasing game. Easy 9/10 for an early access  survival game!
1	played for 30 min did some♥♥♥♥♥♥

1	 players should disappear if some object is in LOS.)This game is in early alpha and im amazed why people r complaining about some problems that the game have and expect to be like some AAA $60 game from the start.I just really hope the devs continue the good work and don't become greedy with some money milking♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game will be the game i was waiting for so long."
-1	Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥look another running simulator but this time I can be fat! lol. just  a slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dayz very very slightly.
1	I recommend it even tho that goddamn sentries shot me twice through a ♥♥♥♥ing rock and i got insta killed. Everything else is okay. Works better than DayZ after years of Early Access.
1	 after getting almost full military gear and AK with 2 full mags + M1 Garand with a clip and ♥♥♥♥♥on of bullets I somehow got spoted and oneshot by sentry through a thick hangar wall."
-1	Бред. Оптимизация вообще отсутствует.
1	 worth buying. Mixed reviews are kids getting mad about their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer not being able to play it."
1	The game I was waiting. Hope vehicles will be added later. I'm fan of STALKER games and this is like I´m back in the Zone. Not the same but still very good.

1	PROS: eating human steak and lime soda to surviveCONS: getting massive diarrhea in the middle of a fight because you at too much human steak and lime soda. 10/10 this game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥
-1	Overall this game is ok at first its all you wanna play then when you learn the pattern you start hating it. with all the good loot on the base surronded by giant robots. so you have these huge towns and no good loot.. just wack♥♥♥♥♥stuff that just wastes invintory. and when you get to the base there is 5000000000 other players camping the loot so pointless. cool mechanics but wack game
1	Kesinlikle oynanması geren bir oyun . Erken eriim olmasına rağmen optimizasyou iyi gtx 1050ti var ve epic ayarlarda 40 alıyorum ortalama oyunu n grafikleri hoş loot iyi Dayz in gelişmiş veriyonu ama Dayzden daha iyi şöyle düşünebiliriz Pupg H1z1 ve Dayz in (dayz daha yakın ) harmanlanmış hali ve fiyatı 32 tl bu fiyat artıcakmış bence fırsat varken alın oyun erken erişimde böyeyse geliştikce ne olur düşünemiyom :)
-1	good concept but♥♥♥♥♥♥quality. extremely hard to conect with friends in a server because u cant search with out it failing to conect. only good for single player. from what ive seen this game with turn to another dayz standalone (great idea but a complete flop)

1	Buy this♥♥♥♥♥
1	 and I will keep updating my review as well as share my expierence later. However keep in mind this game is very much early access and do not expect a full game yet. Nevertheless I am having fun and I think for 16€ this game is worth your money."

1	 but it’s still playable. It’s a very fun and hard survival game to play. It has plenty of potential and I definitely think it’s worth playing. It’s in early access so you can’t call it a broken game yet. It’s definitely worth investing in."
-1	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t only playable at night cause u get more fpsthats all about this game : at night u get 60 fps at day u get 20 fpsreally unplayble and also servers is working so slowmy gpu is 1060 with 6gig ram

1	It’s like DayZ if DayZ was good
-1	It's Dayz.  If you like walking around for hours doing pointless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t only to get a bullet in your head when you go anywhere remotely interesting. This game is for you. if you like a bathroom camping simulator ... this game is for you.If you love nothing more than to be kos and kos . This game is for youIts got zombies too .  The only credit ill give it is that it is a better executed dayz . but that is not saying much seeing as dayz was a dated concept half a decade ago.
-1	 revived got into a village after a few minutes of searching only food a bit of clothing and just ran needed food and got attacked by a zombie and i kept hitting him with melee but it was so♥♥♥♥♥♥that i died.so: 1)at least get 800 resolution so other people with not a good pc can be able to play2)fix melee attack its so broken3)put more of a tutorial for players to know what they have to do or have a sense4)put more looting stuff in the houses at least enough for survival5)make the picking of things easier and make the aim a bit bigger for better gameplaythe game has potential and i hope they fix these problems until then i wouldn't recommend it"
-1	dont buy this game as of now this game is terrible you walk around for 2 hours and find no people the guns are like futuristic laser beams all u do is hold m1 down and pull this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥with good potential buy it in 1 year when this hype dies and u can get a fight. not worth
-1	 you spend 95% of the time walking cause stamina runs out in 15 seconds . the loot is♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere besides the military basis and there youll most likely get killed by someone teleporting around you"
1	لعبة سرفايفل جداً ممتعه واشوف لها مستقبل كبير مع التحديثات القادمه DayZ وايضاً عوضتنا عن الخياس اللي صار في لعبة ولو نجي من ناحية السعر يابلاش 35 ريال سعودي الخلاصه:اذا انت تحب العاب البقاء اللي تجلس فيها بدون نهايه وتعيش في عالمها فهذي هي اللعبه المناسبه لك
-1	Kinda like DayZ and rust PvE is pretty good just now only not much stuff to do once you get gearedCan't recommend it just now because the pvp is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Too much lag and desync.

1	Very enjoy this game as it is different from any other survival game that I have played (and I have played a lot). I really enjoy the features that this game has to offer. Even though that this game is in Beta it is still worth getting as this game is worth more than £15.
1	 I think it would be better if they had to wait 5mins to spawn there as combat gets interesting.Overall this games is 100% worth the £15! see you in game."

-1	Memory leak issues make game practically unplayable if you only have 8GB of RAM. You can play for for maybe half an hour before memory leaks cause freezing. Your PC will freeze up too once you exit the game meaning you have to either restart it or leave it for 10 mins before it’s becomes usable again. Played 12 hours of the game the only two times I’ve died were from freezing at the wrong time. It’s completely ruined what is other wise a decent and detailed survival game. Wait until memory leaks are fixed before buying if you only have 8 GB of RAM.

I honestly hope they continue to fix this issue as I see it to be their largest obstacle to making a really killer survival simulation.

1	 and the game is ♥♥♥♥ING BEAUTIFUL.Can't wait to see the game develop and progress into a full-fledged open world survival game.Also.... I just blacked out in front of the police station after a bottle of whisky and tequila. GG. xDThe game is a little bit too cheap imo tho :3"
1	This game is a brilliant game but it has some flaws and things to look out for for example there is only one place you are going to get a gun first time with little to no effort and that is boot camp located in B3 on the map top left corner but be careful because there is one of the worst things in the game just south of it and yes that is the bunker or one of quite small but dangerous military loot spawns holds a great treasure also it has robots you get 1/2 shot by who see you through the fences and almost always hits you this place would be viable if you could kill the robots but a last you can’t so you will probably be stuck there questioning your life choices as all your hard earned loot fades away but always remember scum giveth and scum will definitely taketh happy hunting you scummy looters
1	game is awesome but optimization is bad i have gtx 1060 6 gb and i have 30 fps i hope they gona fix that in future and loot is♥♥♥♥♥♥i always risk to go to restricted areas and its always all looted
1	♥♥♥♥♥♥'N♥♥♥♥♥♥AGAIN -BUY SCRUM NOW 10 OUTA 10 FER UR HEALTH"
1	 and hopefully they iron out the bugs in animations and movement soon. This game has a lot of great potential and if the devs keep listening to the community and keeping us active this could become an amazing game. To date this is one of the best games I have seen in respect to their lush landscapes and detail in the amazing view distances. The game also seems to be really well optimized (unlike PUBG) running on ultrawides everything on epic this game barely even gets my pc warm. Great to see an early release that doesn’t destroy gpu's or use unnecessary memory (again PUBG.. yep its still broken...)For now I wouldn’t recommend the game to anyone expecting a finished product or not willing to spend a lot of time waiting.. but if your an experienced gamer with a lot of patience for the issues that come with early release games then its worth a go."

1	Will liquid♥♥♥♥♥♥on my friends head again 11/10.But for real this game is great.  If the devs keep it up I can see this game going a long ways.  I played Dayz and breaking point (Arma 3 mod) and I have to say I like this the best out of both of those game.  The loot is very easy to get you wont be mad if you die to the BS aim bot robots haha. To be honest people should play this game more yes there are bug but come on its a early access game if you buy a game to play with 0 bugs you don't play PC games very much or ever.

Pretty game but I'm not sure how I feel about the depth of field blurriness features theyre utilizing to keep people from cheat aiming.If you want a tattoo it has to include ink on the face.  I hate when you beat off and you forget there is nowhere to finish so you do it on your stomach.
1	ı see bad commends and they about scum is not dayz killer dayz better this game sama as dayz  this is wrong because when dayz firs come out ım in middle school and now ım in college see over 7 or 8 years dayz stays alpha but this game come out new we dont now about dayz killer or not for now but this type of comment is not helpful for creators this game has potential if creators dont give up and keep update this game rules the survival games

-1	 The Server browser is♥♥♥♥♥♥Thats enough for me to ruin my experience"
-1	 But for some reason these types of games still don't understand that playing with friends is the best part. I've only got around 4 hours in game ( can't return it now great) and a solid 90% of that was running around trying to find my buddies so we can actually play. Make it so i can ♥♥♥♥ing party up and have us spawn near each other with the icons above our heads and add the ability to see party members on the map. I understand it's in Alpha (or whatever) but to make only very minor improvements on a genre that's been put thru the dirt is pretty sad. 5/8 don't recommend m8."

1	 runs superbly. Beautiful game. I have played for 50 hours now and i have many more to come. For £15 its a bargain. One thing that i would like to see it some sort of base building which i believe they are doing in the form of building fortifications in the future but this isnt a complaint just something i would love to see take this amazing game to the next level. A solid 8.5/10"
1	It´s a game with a lot of potential had a lot of fun while playing it but has some really serious performance issues the only thing i can do since I can´t refund is wait until the devs fix their game.
1	 but the hunt for loot is very fun and beats DayZ in many ways in regards to speed loot abundance and the risk reward factor THE PRICE For £16 or $21 its an absaloute bargain especially when taking into consideration the future of this game and the amount of content you already have you cant beat itRECCOMEND?yes only if you have time."

But like i said. this early access game is far worst than others. most other you can play it's close to finish. but this one is about 5%-10% comple?(and for the♥♥♥♥♥♥shit mechanic. i get it. it's an essential need of human. i would hope there are are options of disabling it. for more pve servers i guess. or skipping animations for pve servers. it's just down right disgusting. ya it is kinda holiarious if you pee on your teammates imaturely but it's really childish and gets old really quick)"

-1	 which bring me to my next point. The crafting system and ui are so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to understand and require so many things just to craft basics; there is no crafting guide or small tutorial telling you how to use it or what you should try and craft first. The map is too big for only 64 players max and the fact you cant loot very fast which makes this game feels like watching paint dry. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game until they stop focusing on making this game look flashy and actually focus on what matters e.g. mechanics and gameplay."

If u have an i5 and over with a decent video card you can prob run this game 70+ fps medium settings. P.S this is one of those games where 30fps feels like your getting 60."

1	THIS IS BETTER THAN DAYZ AND ITS CHEAPER!!!!

We looted all the♥♥♥♥♥♥we could and then finally decided to leave. he decided to go back the way we came and up the ladder. he went to the top and the bot legit stepped over him and shot him in the head. his body fell on me lol and i decided to go the other way through the main door and luckily got out of the bunker and base away from the bots. I can honestly say the little experience so early on was better than all the hours in dayz lol. great game and good devs!!! :D
1	I’m at the bunker laying prone in a fern behind a crate. A mech is stomping towards me and a duo team is looting the warehouse behind me. I have stealth’d in and was confident until I got pinched. My heart is racing and I’m watching the mech patrol pattern to time my escape. I have a 9mm pistol with 3 bullets and no magazine. The Mech suddenly turns to me and I hear an audible “Halt prisoner! Leave this area immediately!” And begins to open fire. This is it. I’m dead. I actually wince at my computer as the bullets fly past me and tear into the duo that opened the warehouse door behind me. They both are immediately dispatched. I wait until the mech finishes his patrol and turns around to pace the other direction. I creep into the warehouse and close the door. I loot their corpses and now have more gear than I can carry. I take their own tactical knife and chop up their corpses. Today was a good day. *actual results may vary

1	 lowered shadow quality and upped texture by 1. Running good for me now. I dont have an exact fps because instead of relying on a number I wanted to just play and see how it works for me. It runs fine. People complain about performance with 1080's which had me worried but I'm not a graphics♥♥♥♥♥♥ just like decent playable framerates and even with my somewhat old rig its working just fine for me. I'll update my reveiw if my personal experience changes but for now I wholeheartedly can say this game is a blast and a wonderful first experience for a realistic survival game. Tarkov gunplay is by far the best of any game I've ever played and still my favorite but the option of gameplay style and depth of survival mechanics leave me feeling very excited about the future of Scum. Thank you Gamespire and may your new IP be long lasting and a prosperous journey for y'all and all your fans."

-1	Game it self seems ok nothing special just a dayz type of game.. the problem is that theres multiplayer which you cant connect to even tho you got a stable internet with over 300mb/s and a high end pc to a server that has 20ping lower or higher..Bought the game and refunded after 20min of trying to connect to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ severs.
-1	I’d honestly rather play DayZ than this.Overhyped and boring.
1	Yeah. Accepted sjw demands and removed an tatoo that looked like an nazi symbol. I accept that it is their decision but i cannot agree with this decision. Dont give sjw an inch. If you do they will take an mile.Enyhow. Lets get to the gameplay.This game is an early acces game witch means that there will be bugs flaws and other that kind of stuff. (i need to point that out). But the gameplay has been so far very good. The vault mechanic is very good and smooth. The gunplay is realistic and things like musclemass will make an difference in recoil for an example.You can make your character different in many ways. For an example you can make an melee build that has alot of melee damage and less stamina loss for an example. Or you can make an sniper build.The game is realistic. This means you have to think about what you eat and what you do. Also you have to take an♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yes you heard me right :DMy last words: I enjoy the game alot. And sometimes there are bugs but i understand that this game will have some bugs becouse. Well it is early acces.I would like to also point out that just becouse some one gets offended becouse something that dosent mean that it should be removed.. I liked the design of that tatoo. And i like to rp sometimes. for an example i made an nazi boyscout.

-1	You basically better be a veteran DayZ player to get the hang of this and even then the newer gameplay variables make it a clunky learning curve. I ate two different berries and died after a minute. Respawned with negative fame and died again. I assume it was one of the berries that killed me but why the ♥♥♥♥ would they do it twice? If you're bored and have 20 bucks to waste then go for it I guess... Otherwise wait for the community to ♥♥♥♥♥ some sense into the Devs.

The game is being updated nearly every day by the devs. It had issues on release but devs fixed most of them by day 3. This game is fun to play alone or with friends. There is definetly room for improvement but it sure does perform hella good considering its only EA game. I recommend buying it without second thought.cheers

1	Fun but at the moment not enough for me if they add more to the game and don’t leave it in early access hell this will be the Dayz gem that never was.

1	 more than the zombies and more than the players and I still love them and think they shake the game up and they should keep them at the military zones. The only thing with this game is the servers NEED to be worked on A.S.A.P it's very laggy and jittery and makes gunfights at military hard and sometimes almost impossible. The other thing is they need server restart notifications.... You can't just restart a server without any warning when you have a system in game where you need to put your clothes on the floor around the fire. I went from being packed with enough supply to last me 10 years to I have a dragonov an ak and a bootknife. If they can fix these two things and tweak everything and ignore all the whiney ♥♥♥♥♥es that complain about hardcore games being too hard then this game will be everything DayZ SHOULD have been."

1	This game is a must have for anyone who loves the survival game genre. It has so much potential & the devs are very active on the support forums. Being Early Access it’s not without its faults but still a very enjoyable experience. Just can’t wait to see what the upcoming months updates have in store for progression of this great game.

1	Great game best survival game in awhile.Its realistic but not so much where it if you don’t like realistic games it won’t ruin it for you.The game is the best early access game I’ve ever played not just survival early access but in general. The gunplay/movement/health/crafting is amazing animations and effects and just overall flawless. BUT BUT BUT BUT 2 things this game really needs is-better servers they restart constantly I mean it was the first day but anyways and 2nd vehicles/base building the map is massive and there should be vehicles and bases not unreleastic sky scraper like rust but good shelters or being able to board up houses anyway currently 8/10

1	i took a♥♥♥♥♥♥and a zombie ate my♥♥♥♥♥ i wish this was a joke.
-1	im going to be honest the concept of this game is absolutely amazing and when its done yes full thumbs up but untill then do NOT! i mean NOT pay to play this game yet. they have just implimented an anti cheat so theres still people that are gliching the game its aggrivating enuff but the main reason i wanted you to know not to buy it is there are realistic elements right? no no theres not its 75% raining all the time and if you get hypothermia and you will you die but not before you play for 3 hrs with 50% stats and puking every 3 seconds. Still sound fun? oh yes well lets try getting heatstrok on top of the hypothermia (whitch you cant get rid of BTW) now you cant do anything ithout dropping whats in you hands getting sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself then forgetting to pick your wepon up everytime you drop it. ok so if that still sounds fun then try fighting off a puppet btw u cant beat a puppet w.o a wepon ive tryed even with full boxing so yes you die again. ok so to reiterate right now you have hypothermia from being out in the rain for more then 30 seconds cuz if u get wet in a game thats alway raining ur pretty much dead then the sun comes out for 10 minutes in real time you dont get dry so your still hypothermic and now you got heastroke and ur gonna die slowly unless yes u guessed it u kill urself and start it all over. well i know im not the only one complaining about it but if you still want to buy the game and SURVIVE!! during it wait untill they have actually fixed alot of the problems cuz people are only ♥♥♥♥♥ing about robots being tough and not being fortnight they want bases. so while thats being tended to surviving in the survival game IMO see that IMO is impossible unless you hid indoors never to get wet

1	Before this review starts let me just say its late and im high so excuse the sloppy grammar. But id really like to put my 2 cents into this game because i have been patientally waiting for this game to come out and although the game is pretty good there are a few things i would liked tweaked.Things i like- Events ! (these ♥♥♥♥♥es are some of the most fun i have had with the game and a great way to get points. Although they need to happen more frequentally or even just a tab in the main menu to put u in a que for one so u can grind up points)- guns and ammo are accesable (although id like to see the clips spawn with ammo a little more often and would it hurt to always spawn guns with a clip? im sick of the goose chain. this game is one of the easyiest survival games to find a gun and clip so thats nice atleast- zombies dropping decnt loot (especally specail zombies like the military ones)Things i dont like-random spawn costs points or atleast cost to much-more towns or a smaller map would have been nicer the distance between and orange blips on your map is always a hike which isnt very fun espaclly when u spawn on the other side of the map from friends. you think the devs would have learned that from dayz Big map size is bad-super gay eating system my guys always hungry and the overcomplex matabalism is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - no tansport on laugh which for this map size is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- loot is pretty hard to find somtimes-friends are not perminent and u can not see them on mapfinal verdictthis is one of the best and smoothest survival game lauches and im hoping to watch this game reach maximum patental.7/10 ATM Buy it and play 4 3 hours see what u think (and if your me refund it and buy it again cause i didnt get anywhere in 3 hours lmao)

1	Türkish language please!!
1	 anyone that played PUBG in it's early days will know how much of a hot mess it was back then. I think what the devs are trying to accomplish here is commendable and once they start ironing out the bugs and adding in new content to get the game to where they envision it being then I think we will have a game that will be around and enjoyable for a while to come.

The mech turned around and then I heard shots I ducked waved jumped but I still got hit 15HP about to bleed out and waiting the bunker door to open. It finally opens I rush inside quickly bandage my self and make a camp inside the bunker put my meat (GAYYYY) in the skewer and cook it while I have some freshly cooked deer meat I enjoy a bottle of water and loot the playThat is just 1 day of ingame Scum I will never forget this moment and I think everyone should make these moments of themselves.

-1	I paid for the support pack for me and a friend I play with on this game. My reason for writing this review is not to slam the game but hopefully the devs read this and fix it. WHERE ARE THE ANIMALS! The map is awesome but there isn't rarely any beast to hunt. Just feels absent with out them.SPENDING MORE TIME LOOKING FOR FOOD! We have this hard core mod with stats and that's cool but I spend more time looking for food than I do enjoying other parts of the game. It get old real fast.CRAFTING! This is honestly the worst looking craft system I have seen in any game. I buy most survival games that come out and most of the time I buy them on day one. Played Ark on day one. These devs need to fix this because it looks stupid.COMBAT! Im a karate teacher and I love me some ninjas I purposely do not use guns in games and I push my stats to do hand to hand combat and I love seeing swords and bows in games because I train with them reg in real life. WHERE ARE THE BOWS! And the hand to hand combat in very weak in this game. This is 2018 guys!SLEEP! Please are a rest mod in the game. I mean you added in♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥mod so how about rest to regain stam and light healing.Other than that Im pretty much enjoying this game but I think I need to maybe play some of the other mmo survival games for a few and check back when they fix these problems.
1	10/10 DONT BUY it yet.Way too laggy and pvp teleporting is unreal...You dont see someone for like an hour plus when you do they teleport side to side.It gives me AIDs. Dont let me get started on the optimization either cuz jesus....Hype the game up and you get these bugs?How?idk..Once they fix these little things then you 10/10 buy it.p.s. This post was posted at 3am sorry for the horrible typing to late for this♥♥♥♥♥♥<3UPDATE: The issues have been fixed praise the lord!!!Now spend that easy 20$ because its worth it!THANK YOU DEVS!Love YA!

1	Pretty good game dont blame it its EA you dumb♥♥♥♥s
1	took the best♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever had in any game ever XD This game has so much stuff in it (considering this is day 1 EA) even DayZ devs migrated to SCUM.Can't wait to see what will come next. As a EA game the optiziation is really good right now.
1	Incredible game for early access. Perfect mix of a hardcore survival game and being a game and not a running simulator. I love the hardcore system w arcade elements. The character model isn’t the best but that is my only complaint. Very excited to see what the future holds for this game
1	It's an Early Access. Calm your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thanks.
1	 how about leveling other skills faster?? i.e a fat smart crim can skill up 2-10x faster than a dumb buff crim.- Dont make this game easier... simply make it more rewarding and open ended for those prepared to commit and to excel at survival.​- Better animal tracking/higher spawns (maybe use the focus ability to show old poop/tracks so you know your within the 'spwan/roam' area of a creature to hunt (maybe require lvl2/3 survival to do this??)For now the learning curve is steep... learning to manage loot and to simply survive is a challenge however give it a few hours and you will have the basics under control. There really isnt much depth beyond this yet though - consider this game a survival sandbox"

1	 it’s an amazing game with so much potential. The devs have delivered a game Early Access that already knocks the socks off most rival games in the genre. Its exciting to think of how good this could actually be 6-12 months down the line! So far I’d say its more than worth the money!"

1	 but the lag is♥♥♥♥♥♥at times.  it can be good for hours then when something like running for your life it get's all ♥♥♥♥in choppy. Please fix only issue."
-1	I like a lot of things in it; but I cannot recommend until they fix the roblox gunplay and  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE server performance.Although I enjoy micromanaging macronutrients like I do IRL how long will that keep me interested. Only things you can really do is sneak around the mechs and search empty military boxes and die. Never played a game with such realistic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
1	 £15 isn't anything to worry about. It's £15 if you're complaining about that then I think you should go get a job instead of playing games.This is already better the DayZ and has acomplished more; sales wise and mechanically than DayZ.Only downside is that apart from looting military bases and crafting there doesn't seem to be much more at the moment."

1	 not had an issue with optimisation. Must be what server you join maybe ping? The game is in a very good state for £15 and a lot of fun."
1	You guys gotta chill. Lol. So many people were waiting for this game to release. I can’t get into an online match but I’m cool with that. Happens with a lot of highly anticipated games. The servers got overrun. I expected that.  I know they will fix it so I’m not worried about it.  I played some single player instead. I really like this game. I came upon a prison that had mechs everywhere and zombies roaming everywhere. Snuck in. Avoiding the mechs was fun and tense.  Sneaking from building to building.  Look. The game is cool. Runs fine. As soon as the server thing gets worked out and I can try multiplayer I’m going to be very happy with this game. BUY it. It’s going to be so much better than PUBG. Thumbs up from me.
-1	 they need to update it and get out of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deals."
1	 dont like mac's I prefer the mac and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ network performance. once fixed: 9/10."
1	I can be a licensed nutritionist after playing SCUM 10/10Great ♥♥♥♥ing game
1	 there are MAJOR things you should be aware of. which are problems that usally come with the genre and with Early Access Games in general like: - The time-consuming gameplay (Wandering and such) - The performance issues; Whether server-wise or running the game itself - For some people: the lack of total content (Endgame content other than Leveling and PvP) - Severly punishing gameplay when being careless or unprepared - A complicated inventory-system - Needing a lot of skill and luck in everthing you do - The bugs and unfinishednessJust to name a few.But this game just entered early access and already fixed and added a lot. Things like proper basebuilding are coming soon and i am excited to see how much they while add upon the already enjoyable foundation they present....And this comes from somebody who grew sick of early access ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like ARK-DLCs and 10 year development of a DayZ-Standalone Bicycle years ago. So I am happy to say: ""dis shid gud!1!!"""

1	 all the salty sea dogs throwing the game under is not representative of the game at all. Obviously there used to spending £40 on a fully optimised game rather than being part of a development journey."

1	I bought this game just because i have realy good hopes for the near future.They release a very good game with decent optimization and a lot of content as a pre aplha game.The only problem is the servers and the desycn right now (you cannot fight and pvp right now cause of a lot of lag and♥♥♥♥♥♥BUT.if you are a little optimistic and a little patient you know they gonna fix it 100% and probably even make it smoother than your butt.Compare this game to ther survivals out there(not battle royals)   and you can easily see what a masterpiece this is gonna be soon if not it is already.You can play SOLO.you can play with your Squad(which is much better).So find friends and hang out with them in a Realistic World ."

1	 some issues but overall well worth releasing at this stage. Most advanced survival/health features in any game so far. Complex crafting system (Maybe too much for low patience fps players).Worth my £15 for the experience below alone :)- Spawned near mech area- Dodged them and escaped after looting an Ak47 with no bullets- Down to 30% health as i got shot by a mech- Robbed a random guy with my empty gun- Guy had bullets for my gun- Shot guy with my now loaded gun- Guy also had bandages to heal me- A bear appeared and ate me- Karma is a ♥♥♥♥♥ :)"
1	 if you are more into surviving and living along side the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of scum just stay away from military areas..still has to add alot to the game before its complete; it is EA so what do you expect? 20 $ for this is more then worth it."

1	I like the game. Highly recommend it. Although it has many bugs. Most of them will most likely be patched. But devs please for the love of ♥♥♥♥ing god fix the god damn server problems please.

-1	it was hard for me to write about my thoughts for SCUM review...this game realy has the walking dead feeling (30hours on alt)first of all i love the survival/metabolism and i have been watching alot of videos and live streams about this game.BUT.... its just another DayZ and PUBG BATTLEROYALE community that just kill on sight! (that makes me vote thumbs down)😞 i hate online pvp in generali can just play singleplayeranyways.... its early access i sure wish for the best that its not gona become another failure!https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/0/2590022385655766696/

-1	 1k in dayz and 2k in arma so I'm not♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I've died at more than half of the military bunkers I've tried to enter cause the mechs are absolutely broken. The is far too big to run across cause you die of starvation before you even make it to your friend. It needs a lot more work before I'm willing to give it another chance but imo rust is a muchhhhhh better game."
-1	 forever in Early Access.♥♥♥♥♥♥ John♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game aint good."
1	Pretty gut gaem. Butt less transformer pls. Also server ping quite high yes. pls fix.p.s. I liek that u can take♥♥♥♥♥♥and pee on daed body!
-1	Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game jesus christ....Desync should be its name
1	This game is hardcore and fun. The negative reviews are from ping swears who don’t understand why they keep dieing. This game is 10x better than Dayz must buy
1	This game is amazing I've only played 2hrs but in those 2hrs I went from running around in my undies to ♥♥♥♥ing over 3 full geared guys that had shotguns with a bloody pistol.....tbh you might want to worry more about zombies than actual players oh and devs pls nerf m9 pistol xD.
1	 enjoy it and wait for what’s to come!"
-1	 get killed by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Spawn 4 squares away and run for 3 hours again.SCREW THIS GAME"
1	 Servers did wipe and I lost everything but hey ho its early access for a reason right.. to work this♥♥♥♥♥♥out.. keep up the good work the world looks gorgeous and the mechs remind me of alien haha"
-1	 but unfortunately due to the extremely bad lagging and rubber-banding whenever you run into other players as well as all the hackers from China that are continuously killing everyone on most servers even official ones that I joined. I can’t recommend this game now as it’s really is not enjoyable to play they should’ve region locked the game to Europe and United States only because unfortunately it’s being hacked to death which makes it very frustrating to play."
-1	i really want to love the game but for now i cant recommend it the towns are empty with little to no loot i was hoping to play with my girlfriend but i dont want to pay £20 for a server for 2 people for a £15 game may look at it again in the future.....
-1	THIS GAME SUCKS DONT BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥NOT EARLY ACCES AND NO FULL GAME NEVER ITS A BIG BLACK FOSILIZED♥♥♥♥♥

1	 the few mechanics that work are absolutely fascinating. I haven't felt this immersed in a survival game since ♥♥♥♥ing minecraft. These guys are busting their balls to make something great and the results already show. Show them some support!"
1	For the few hours I've played of this game I have thoroughly enjoyed them.Stutters a bit in big towns but the game did only come out a couple days ago8/10 gud♥♥♥♥♥
1	 I love this game.I hate the People who give negativ rewievs while writing something like this "" WHOOOO CHEATERS!"" or ""♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME SERVER DOWN "" but they dont get that this is EA and well i guess the devs didnt think that 60-80k ppl want to play at day one soo yeah Hope this game goes a long way luv it!"
-1	 what is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Definitely not worth!"
-1	This game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sucks
1	Get♥♥♥♥♥♥on ♥♥♥♥♥is
1	 I have not experienced anything negative about it. But then again at the moment I only have 2 hours dumped into it so that might change. But I have not come across and “hackers” or glitches with the AI. Map is huge and that could be both a good and bad thing. Depends on how you look at the aspect of the both.    But overall I recommend the game. It’s got immense potential in it. People are complaint and writing negative reviews over the smallest and most insignificant things. Also you can poop in the game."
1	 and the deer scurried off. I continued to track his blood for about another 10 minutes. I can’t describe the satisfaction when I found him dead under a tree about half a mile from the initial shot. I then died from starvation. Brilliant."
1	Very nice game. pretty CPU intensive but hopefully it should be optimised soon. Definetly not perfect but its been out for like 2 days and its already doing better than DayZ and has less bugs. Would reccommend if you have the money but if not just wait until they add cool new♥♥♥♥♥♥and optimise it more.
1	bug还是真的多  希望能好好更新更新
-1	 takes too long to get to a friend or find a random player because only 64  player servers.  Server browser selects the slot instead of the server you tried to click on making it hard to get  on a specific server You have to worry about carbs and♥♥♥♥♥♥ just let me eat it's already hard enough to find food.  The metabolism too hard to understand.  Controlls tab doesnt shot all of the keybindings."
-1	♥♥♥♥♥♥ game
1	very good game اللعبة تحفة الصراحة
1	Needs more loot and a couple lag fixes. I was fulllly loaded with gear at military base like FULLLY LOADED and didnt realize i could no longer outrun the zombies. needs a little work on the clunky weapon firing and zombies seeing and hearing you behing walls but this is definitely everything dayz never finished. allow destroying and repairing of the mech to pilot it and add a car or motorcycle and more sound effects and it is good to go. Add larger♥♥♥♥♥♥and urine effects.
1	 the zombies are acually hard to kill i like that a lot and it feels wayyyyy better then day z ever did xD keep it up devs ^^ but one negativ thing the hunger system is quite complicated right now and its hard to see if u are acually starving or only out of energy try make the energy bar a bit more hunger represantiv so u can tell better if u are starving or not. :) but other wise i will keep playing and i am really intrested in the higher level skills ^^ i am looking forward to test that out a bit more later on ;)edit: and the drones are really nice xD and creepy and i saw a base where some robots and npc are roming i love the fact that it feels like a living world where u try to survive and fight over resources and so on ^^ love itedit 31.08.2018 new update and i have to play it in german?? yeah i live in austria but wtf i dont play any game on german -.- and no option to change it .......... come on guys what is this i dont want to play it in german!!!!!!!!!!! give me back the english version wtf is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ just a fair warning that change just ruinied me the game i like to play gameso n english cause its sounds way better an the german language sucks balls ... plz just let me ♥♥♥♥ing choose what language i want to play in wtf is this♥♥♥♥♥"
-1	So i'v spent all night getting the basics of this game. So were gonna just hop right onto the bugs because we care more about them and especially if their game breaking right? Their combat system becamed completely ♥♥♥♥ed because people are lagging about tremendously and making Australian's playing on US servers look good. There is an enormous amount of player vs. player lag which makes this game an actual joke at this current state. Another horrible nightmare to go through is crossing a river. Your character would normally go up but gets sucked down or physically won't go up til you reach the other side. So this causes this huge panic will I drown? BIGGEST issue that has arised with the game comes from FPS drops which accumulate through maybe some memory leak? Basically relog into the server and badaboom your LAG VANISHES. Your welcome on that one. The server side lag for people in combat your ♥♥♥♥ed killed a very geared player while laughing it off. Poor guy hates me and I hate me but were even right? I love you guys hope I help some poor soul thinking about buying it. Maybe watch more gameplay. Enjoy the fantasy but the load of ♥♥♥♥♥ people are taking in game are stinking it up like High hell baby. ALSO last note these robots have enormous issues with seeing people through a wall like nothing BEWARE. AT THIS VERY MOMENT. NOT RECOMMENDED. once these kinks and things are smoothed out hey give it a shot
1	i start with 120fps slowly end up on 55-50 over a long period this is on a 1080 this is an bug of some sort servers are a dysnc sometimes.. but i will not sit here and give an early access game a bad rating over bugs and server issues i played it for 7 hours and loved every minute of it sneaking past robots well having liquid ♥♥♥♥♥ was great.. this game is a rough dimond at the minute but its going to be great over time I WILL BE HERE ALL THE WAY thanks devs
1	Threw a chickens egg at two guys fighting then fist punched the winner to death. Took all their clothes and chopped them into human steaks then threw up outside from overeating Watermelon slices. Threw a Ninja star at a fat guy then ran into the woods to take two ♥♥♥♥♥ and eat some sardines from a tin then ran a small marathon and thew up again. Not bad.
1	Love the game! Perfect survival game so far. All the haters making the reviews mixed are ALL ♥♥♥♥♥ing about server lag in a 1 week out EA game. Reviews shouldnt even be allowed beyond Curators.

-1	THE BIGGEST OVERHYPED PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS YEAR.3 STEPS ON HOW TO GET HYPED:- PAY CANCER STREAMERS MONEY TO HYPE YOUR GAME- BE IN EARLY ACCESS - HAVE A MISLEADING TRAILER AND DESCRIPTION♥♥♥♥ING DESYNC LOW OPTIMIZATION
-1	"This feels like fraud. They advertised this game heavily over Twitch by handing out free copies to streamers and having dedicated servers run as best they could. The streamers played with each other while overhyping everything and there were zombies ""puppets"" everywhere. The reality is the servers run surprisingly well..... but there are no zombies. This is like pubg without people being forced to encounter each other. And why explore other parts of the map when the only good loot is in the military area so heavily patrolled by mech warriors that pvp is♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is the biggest let down since No Mans Sky."

1	 guns etc to find problems if they arise so they can be fixed and improved. I’m hoping in a few months time the loot will become more scarce like it would be in real life! I don’t know how ANYONE can give this game a bad rating just hours in and the FACT it’s in DEVELOPMENT EARLY ACCESS bizarres me. The game is 15 quid. All I can say is I will be pumping hours into this game and backing the devs 100% so keep up the good work!"
1	 features and patchs to come. Uninstalled DayZ (hopefully for the very last time).My only hope that Croteam and Gamepries will not ruin their own game but cheap monetization and keep making SCUM what it can evolve into – the De-facto Open world Survival game."

1	This is a very fun game that’s going to be the newest and greatest survival game of the year. I haven’t yet played it but I can tell you that it’s worth the buy
-1	what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game lol map is copy paste all over the place same buildings same mechs same zombies same colors what a cheap overhyped♥♥♥♥♥♥
1	 but not too fast. ofc on an early release/early acces there will be problems and with this game there sertainly is. The pvp combat is just unplayable! Other players just warp around! You can't enjoy a gun or a melee fight. But i love the idea of the 'mechs' who patrol the military areas. But their AI is so bad they will shoot you or see you when you're behind a corner or inside a house. I think there should be more of those mechs like a smaller walking one that will spot you and sound like an alarm what will alarm other players and the bigger mechs. But even with these 'bugs' i still love the game and if you havent buyed it yet DO IT! It's only 20€ It became one of my favourite games the moment i started it. And one thing. make the boxes moveable. But in my opinion the game is 4/5 because of the ai and pvp problems. Once they fix it it will be 5/5."

1	Ugh....'Early Access' the games always sound amazing and...MAYBE work...half the time!!! But....as for SCUM....it's got good potential! The concept is definitely there and it's fun to play! My GPU doesn't meet requiremnts so I don't expect it to run the best anyways....but it did run well! I wish there was more loot!! every life I've played(mind you not many as of yet) I have foud nothing except a few articles of clothing...we need more items! Even if Junk items..something! I had 2 hostile encounters so far and each one was laggy as hell with both us of each time flying from spot to spot. i feel the first guy was having the same issue as he eventually ran off. The second guy shot me dead no issues hahahhaha! I watched some streams where it seems to run kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ during some other peoples battles too...it's Early Access so there is obvious work to do! Once servers smooth out and everything is a bit more optimized I can see this game being killer fun!

1	Had it for 3 days already dumped 14 hours into it.  This game is the beggining of something amazing. Coming off of average and sub par survival games this is up there with The Forest for me. I hear people complaining of crashes so far I have none to speak of.Playing on a 1070ti with 16gb of DDR4 and an i7 7700k I've not real issues. Framerate is stable at 90fps on max settings with the occasional stutter when a big city loads.I will say if you go play on an online server there are some hitches in connetion. A LOT of the servers are in the EU so my ping is around 100 playing from the US. Sucks that renting a servering will cost me 20 bucks a month for my community so I'm going to wait for that to come down a bit. The developers seem very committed to this game and community and I'm going to continue playing this until I've explored all of the map and dominate a sever with my friends. Looking forward to what is coming in the future! 100 PERCENT WORTH THE 20$ (I paid 29.99 so I could♥♥♥♥♥♥out items from the ol' prison wallet)
-1	Worst game I've played in a long time. It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥show from the get go.
1	My Canadian buddy Koal was telling me about this game and said I should get it. We joined a server and started making our shelter in the woods. We finished crafting our 3rd storage chest and hear a loud roar just a few meters away!! A big♥♥♥♥♥grizzly comes charging at Koal!! I try to buck a few rounds off with the ol' pump action! I aimed down sight and missed!! The bear is just too fast! Koal gets mauled with a big right paw and folds like grandma's lawn chair on the front porch. I try to shoot the bear again but he is just a bobbin an a weavin! Koal comes to and tries to retreat  but the bear is on his♥♥♥♥♥like some brothas at the KFC buffet. Again he gets batted with a right paw and buckles like a suitcase. His head looks like a bowl of plums. I can't believe Koal is still alive!! But he pulls himself together playing tag around a couple big cedar trees. The bear isn't taking any of his Sh!t and charges!! Koal gets knocked down again and the bear is on top of him about to finish him off!! Koal whips out his big iron and scores a crit!!! The bear lets out a massive groan and rolls off my Friendly Canadian buddy. I can't believe he killed the bear and lived to tell the tale!! I chopped off the bears head and made a hat out of it.TL/DR     11/10 would watch my buddy Koal get taken out Revenant style again!!

And somehow its fun!EDIT:Day 3: Played the game with a friend today it was much more fun. Took me 30 minutes to setup a camp fire and eat a human we found chopped up in a police station. It was very fun and SO AMAZING once you play with another person. Also found alot of guns inspite of what some angry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are saying the game is amazing atm. No server crashes or any problems. Just have one problem atm. Ate too much human meat and now I have consumed 20k Calories but only used 5k. Dierriah 24/7

The game looks good! smooth game play and for an early game the lack of BUGS is amazing!can't wait until they add some sort of car/bike or even no stamina so we could run to friends without fail would be good.Hope they add more building options in the future to secure the loot better.Can't wait to see what the future has for us ♥

-1	ROBOTS RUIN EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME. SHOOT YOU THROUGH WALLS LOCK ONTO YOU AND ONE SHOT YOU WHEN YOU ARENT EVEN IN THEIR COMPOUND. TRASH.*edit* now theres a update where robots start immediately shooting at you and start hunting you down and can enter buildings. Great. All the most interesting parts of the map you can no longer explore without instant death. No point in even going to them honestly.Moderate learning curve once you adapt and learn to survive its pretty enjoyable. I just avoid the compounds and anywhere with robots in general they updated them to be more innacurate but the risks outweigh the rewards. Its just a shame alot of the main points of interest cant be explored or enjoyed without getting domed by robots. My main gripe with the game so far. Just hit 500 fame points.*So now theres less robots but now they aimbot you through ♥♥♥♥ing walls. seriously they shoot through the god damn walls. leaving 90 perceent of the interesting parts of your map unexplorable. how can you continue to ♥♥♥♥ up these stupid god damn robots every patch. dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing part of a otherwise great game.

-1	"To be honest ive never been so dissapointed after purchasing a game. Campfires and cooking meat skewers doesnt work. Might as well loot for your food and not bother with the interesting hunting mechanics. I decided eating doritos and corn was the easier way to go.Was scared of all the people saying rain was a hazard. Ran for an hour during nighttime and was fine.Also ties into the campfire mechanics being useless since my body tempurature wasnt affected by my campfire.Which also ties into the lack of feedback with any mechanic in the game.How long does a cmapfire last? who knows.. How cooked is my meat? who knows...My component need to be at full health in order for my item to craft? oh thanks for telling me...My shelter doesnt provide any sort of protection? too bad i spent 20 minutes moving 5 sticks around...The crafting is terrible.Calories in and out is one thing. But to measure vitamins and minerals when food is so sparce is completely mind boggling and begs me to ask the same question..Why? Why should i measure any type of vitamin defficiency when i have to eat everything i come across to keep my calories from going negative.Any article or video ive consulted to try and figure out certain problems have all ended in the same fashion. they dont even know what their doing either.This all leads me to the final part.the community is already toxic.but not for reason you may think.people seem to be brainwashed into thinking this is some in depth game.(most of these bodily measurement are purely fluff) and its true...the reason why this community is so toxicthe game is so bad at giving the player feedback about what he or she may be doing so much so that the few people who have figured out the strange nuances are left to scold any players who may be confused under the guise that ""confused players are just people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning because the game isnt on easy mode"" and ""if enough casuals play this game and complain then itll be dayz all over again""no the game isnt complex. its just put together very terribly.no its not some reality simulator.its just a game with too much going on for no reason.its dissapointing to see so many people defending and be turned into apoligists just because their favorite streamer played it a few times.to be honest 90% of stream highlights on youtube are clips of people♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on each other.big streamers will not be playing this game in a few weeks if it stays as confusing and overengineered as it is.then players will fall offIf youve made it this far i hope youve taken this with a grain of salt because i really think this game does have potential...just not in the way its meant to be played now...."

-1	 just great .Ill let this one pass and leave this game for the younger crowd. I can feel my nerves already boiling. The devs says that they made crafting hard because they want to ""implement"" more realism to it. (The game as 3rd person) Well you sure nailed ""realism"" when you gave us the ability to zoom in at any♥♥♥♥♥♥♥point in the game . So you can just be in prone in 3rd person camped in the bush with total visual of whats going on around you . This game should be in 1st person PERIOD. ***Clap clap clap  GOOD GAME"

1	Very cool concept with lots of potential! One big downside is how hard it is to play with friends I had 4 friends in a lobby tonight we played for probably 3 hours and not once were we all together because one of us would spawn so far away and by the time the got there one of us would die and so on. It’s also a pain to try and get in the game as the servers are inconsistent. The addition of vehicles would improve this game dramatically

-1	Game is fun for looting but garbage for the actual shooter mechanic. It runs pretty well until you see other players. They lag around the server so you can´t shoot them. Winning a firefight is actually just pure luck. After this happened to me for the third time I just refunded.
