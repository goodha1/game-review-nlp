Shooting at puppets and only hitting the wall behind them sucksPuppets and players vanish at certain ranges and viewing angles (alt look makes players behind you disappear)The quick access keys (3-0) unbind after every log offItems can disappear from inventory after log off (multiple people experinced items disappearing from trousers)Lack of guidance with some of the featuresNo vehiclesNo real base building e.g. tents	 floors	 walls	 ceilings	 sandbags  - this made similar games (mods) like epoch and wasteland amazingly addictiveAs you can see	 there are a lot of cons. If you're willing to accept the game in its current state you can have a lot of fun but it leaves a lot to be desired.I recommend a purchase	 the developer just need to ramp up their game now they have a lot of fans.Don't leave us hanging like DayZ standalone."

For me a major issue is the Fame system	 I understand things like limiting player spawnability etc but to take it to the point that you get spawn delays after repeated deaths is pretty silly. Also quick idea	 allow us to choose a squadmate to spawn on	 it'd be pretty nice :).So far there are a few hilarious and fun things i've done on this game so far	 i've killed someone and literally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on them	 what game can you do that on other than scum?

We could use 1.day/night time ajustments cause nights are to long (people are complaining) 2. Weather on / off option3. Ability to make some slots reserved for admins and mods and others open to public on same server. 4. More customized loot percentage option to adjust ( because scopes and food is really low on spawning.5. The ability to use our own custom screen for server loading ( Almost all server host offer this) Gportal has said that yous have to open the options for them to offer to us owners. Other than that the game is amazing having a blast. Thanks

There seem to be some misleading negative reviews.First and foremost	 if you enjoyed the Arma mod version of DayZ	 you will undoubtedly enjoy this	 even in its current state.  It is worth $20 just to be able to see at night	 not have to load up special launchers	 and deal with the limitations of being a mod.The game runs great for me on an entirely un-OC 6600k	 GTX 1070	 16 GB	 installed on a middle of the road SSD.  I hold over 60fps at all times with ALL settings maxed at 1080p.  It is buttery smooth on a 240hz GSync monitor.So far	 I have not encountered any game breaking bugs.  BUT	 I have only played on my buddy's rented server connected via IP.The game is hardcore but I feel it is approachable.  Just know what you are getting into (this is aimed at the stupid 'running simulator' comments).  We are on public day 2	 and there have been 2 patches.  Fast reaction by the devs and the polish on this going into EA gives me hope for the devs even though I know very little of them before now.As it stands	 it is very much EA in its content but there is enough to enjoy if you genuinely enjoy survival games and/or DayZ (Mod).  EA is always a gamble but dont let anyone fool you into thinking it is unpolished to some crazy degree.  Know what you are getting into with what you have to run it with	 and know what your expectations should be and you will enjoy your $20."

It's alpha so obviously there are some things to improve on whether it be performance or just polishing up. The best way I can describe this would be 7 Days to Die meets DayZ. The crafting was much more indepth than I expected. When I killed my first boar I had to skin it	 gut it	 chop it into sections and then seperate those sections into meat	 bone	 and fat. Super cool amounts of detail. The metabolism might be a little intimidating to some but it's an interesting feature to the game. I've seen other reviews that complained about loot problems	 crashes	 poor graphics	 and lag. I've personally experience very little of these problems.

513710	1	0	max_james	335	7	1	46.6	August 30	 201	"I'm usually not one to review games I buy	 but I feel this game is getting a lot of negative reviews for reasons that don't make sense.First	 a story:I was running back to my camp in the forest after doing a ""stealth"" loot run of a shipping yard. I had to fight my way out	 so I was on low health	 with no meds. As I approached my camp	 I heard the sound of an animal. I thought it was a boar. It was not. It was a bear. I turned and started sprinting	 running for my life. I ran out of stamina. The bear mauled me in the back of my head	 and then RAN OFF. Thank god I found a military helmet and a riot vest. By the time I came to	 the bear was gone	 and I was almost dead. I had to cut my shirt up to make rags to close my wounds	 then went to my camp and got meds. I was under 10% health. I never found that bear.....I have many more stories about running from animals	 zombies	 mechs	 and players	 all coming from ~17 hours of gameplay. I have definitely already gotten $20 worth of entertainment.The Review:I think a lot of people went into this expecting a completed game	 or something completely different than what the game is.Scum is a survival game	 with an emphisis on survival rather than PvP (from my experience). This game is NOT going to replace Rust	 Escape From Tarkov	 etc. This game is a great environment to get lost in	 focusing on gearing up while staying safe from mechs	 puppets (zombies)	 players	 and nature. Most players I have come across have provided funny	 entertaining	 and helpful encounters	 rather than just killing everyone on sight.The Positives:+ Loot economy seems very balanced. High risk areas reward you well	 low risk areas reward you poorly.+ The melee combat system is very fun	 good timing / skill based system.+ The survival system (hunger	 thirst	 nutrients	 temp	 etc) is very in depth	 and gives a unique experience.+ The map is big	 and not big just for the sake of being big. There's always something cool to explore / loot along the way to your final destination.+ Guns aren't insanely rare	 and ammo is craftable.+ The crafting system makes sense	 with interchangable items where they make sense. (Using either wire / rope / tree bark rope instead of only having one item with one way to get it)+ PvP is fun	 and goofy (because of current EA bugs). I had a fight where there were 6-8 people running around trying to hit each other with spears	 axes and knives	 and two people shooting into the mess trying not to hit their friends.+ It's just a fun game	 as long as you're not expecting CONSTANT action. This is not Rust.+ You're able to learn everything about the survival system without tutorials	 and just through trial and error.The Negatives:- It's definitely got a fair share of bugs	 but nothing is *gamebreaking* that I've come across.- Since the map is big	 and there are no vehicles	 it can take a while to meet up with your friends because you cannot spawn together. However	 this usually means you have decent loot by the time you meet up as well.- The server list is absolutely dreadful	 and not being able to invite friends through Steam to a server is annoying.- Only one option for server hosting	 if you're into that kind of stuff.- Game optimizations leaves room to be desired	 just like any EA game.- UI feels outdated.Honestly that's all I can think of. I've spent 17.4 hours in the game at the time of this review and it's been out for two days. I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take the game!"

As an early access game SCUM’s gameplay	 beautiful graphics	 giant map	 multi-step crafting system and in-depth character customization is worth every bit of the $20 price tag. You can expect some video issues depending on your setup. However	 the developers have been tuned in to the community and patching key issues quite frequently. Dig in a bit deeper and you’ll find a hunting system that in my opinion is one of the best survival aspects of the game. Crafting takes time and the most lucrative crafting recipes require the combination of multiple other recipes. Looters galore: Clothing	 medical supplies	 weapons	 food	 and dozens of other supplies are pretty limited outside large cites and military compounds. But one can still find hope in the surrounding small towns and farms that are littered all over the map. Your charector will be under a constant threat. Zombies are everywhere and can run pretty damned fast. If that’s not enough	 you will have to constantly look over your shoulders for fellow scum looking to take your hard earned loot. Wild animals like the boar and the bear won’t make life any easier. Being quiet and well equipped will make life easier but getting the needed fire power and storage will ultimately lead you sneaking into a military compound where the ultimate threat awaits. A threat easily avoided if  greed takes a back seat.I look forward in seeing future content. Base building	 vehicles	 and most of all	 a deeper introduction to the metabolism system. Hopefully	 introducing diseases and injuries that sets this game aside from all other survival/horror games.Drop the $20 and give it a try. If anything you’ll get to kill some zombie before they kill you."

Just remember its still in alpha and still has a plethera of bugs. You are paying to participate in the alpha and this game has a lot of potential; So much so I bet it will be more than $19.99 when it hits 1.0. Totally worth it imo. Can get stale without friends.

For an early access game this is a fantastic game! Very detailed and fun to play.  I haven't played this game with friends yet but i'm sure when I do it will be a blast. There's a small bug here and there but that part of it in this stage of the game. This is way better than I expected it to be.

SCUM is exactly like the five year old game with some additional resources to fit into the setting like the Metal Gear Solid mechs	 becoming fat/skinny relative to what you eat	 and stat points to make you stronger (Strength	 Dexterity	 Constitution	 and Intelligence). I wasn't really mesmerized when beginning SCUM. Ninety-five percent of the mechanics were there along with the graphics	 but I still found enjoyment. The melee fights against the Puppets (zombies) is hard at first	 but all you have to do is run backwards while they are chasing you and attack immediately after they take a swing; that's your opening!

I kept hearing it’s a Dayz killer so had to look	 as I also got back into the 'reboot' of dayz and 0.63 experimental branch (very limited right now) but first thing that hit me was the difference in graphical style	 seems a bit cartoony to me and there is a lack of atmosphere.The stats where confusing (well	 only gave it one hour	 guess I could get used to them in time) and looting was repetitive… click a box	 see if it has an item	 click a bush	 see if it has a fruit	  and a little search timer… kinda like ‘Date of decay 1’. How items are presented has been an issue for me in Dayz	 they are still spawned in plies like the mod	 and I have said I wish to see them in containers as well	 but containers that take a method to get into (a key	 a crowbar) so that the first fresh spawn with no tools does not just loot the whole place (oh also wanted locked weapons cabinets	 for reasons I will touch on in a min). I went from building to building in ‘Scum’ seeing the same cabinets	 boxes and bags… so boxes with different meshes. Unless an item has been dropped by a player	 it’s in a box	 you know exactly where to look	 then you have to click each box in each building (no methods needed to access them	 at least in the starting areas where I was). This is a step back from where dayz is now	 with its piles of loot	 at least you had an instant visual representation and not some repetitive click and wait mechanic	 felt like playing ‘scratch cards’ some people like that buzz Back to the weapons cabinets I wanna see in Dayz	 the reason is so that fresh player can’t just run to a weapons location and load up then play PvP/KOS… Form the short time I played ‘Scum’ I must say	 they seem to have made efforts to stop that happening. Yes I did come across one gun (would have been 2-3 in dayz	 in the same time) but ammo seems to be rare or has to be made. Ammo in Dayz is so easy to find	 people are happy to waste is Killing fresh spawns or none threats. Be interesting to see if ‘Scum’ have manage to reduce KOSing of not threatening players (e.g. a player that has no kit or very little)Although this game is not to my tastes	 the lives stream I saw seemed to show enjoyment (once the server let people in	 but that expect on a launch)…. So I would suggest seeing the live steams	 but for it being a Dayz killer… I feel they are two different styles	 if you back in dayz 0.63 and testing and excited to see what they do next	 maybe ‘Scum’ will not met your needs… if you hate the mechanics of Dazy	 then sure	 ‘Scum’ may be just what you’re looking for :)Not gonna get a refund	 wanna see how ‘scum’ develops… may not be my type of game	 but I think they will make something quite fun.NOTE: Do not turn this review into a Dayz hate thread	 regarding its development times… problems happen."

People need to remember that it's early access and literally just came out. There will be issues. There will be bugs. And on top of all that it's only $20.

You freaking understand what ""Early Access"" or ""Alpha"" entails before writing your own reviews. Incase you don't a game in early access means it lacks content and is full of bugs. Reviews that contain phrases like ""Lacks Content"" are written by lesser players. You know why? Because there is a development roadmap stickied to the top of the dicussion section and the game is ""EARLY ACCESS"".2. You understand that reviews where people complain about things like HP not regening fast enought need to realise that this is a immersive surival game and that if your stranded in the woods in real life	 if you tear up your clothing to make a bandage	 and you use it you aren't going to magically increase in blood at an exponentially fast rate. Its suppost to be realistic and immersive and in scum your blood regens 1000% faster than in real life yet lesser players still complain.This game wouldn't have mixed reviews if people understood what ""early access"" entails and did 2 minutes of research before spending 20$ on a game."

I just played a little bit with my friend and this game seems basically like Miscreated but probably better. Unfortunately	 even considering this is early access	 I can't recommend an FPS game that forces you to toggle ADS with RMB without an option to hold RMB for ADS instead. By default	 holding the RMB goes into a ""focus"" mode where you just slightly zoom in your view	 clicking RMB toggles ADS	 and middle mouse is toggle weapon firing modes. I'd move toggling weapon firing modes to N (B is already used by another function)	 then use middle mouse for the ""focus"" zoom feature	 and then have holding RMB for my ADS	 but there's no way for me to set it up that way right now.  I just can't understand how (again yes it's early access but still) you could release an FPS game and not allow hold vs toggle options in settings.If it ever changes so we can use hold for ADS I'll probably update this review."

There's no modes of transportation either which really makes traveling super bording considering the fact it takes an hour to run from one side of the map to the other.1) No Vehicles2) No base/build system3) Crafting is annoying4) Game lags when loading new chunks5) There's no admin system so hosting your own server will be fun considering you can't kick or ban anyone (from your own server)

Please focus on PVE.. Its an amazing game. We need coop for singleplayer for sure! Also can we have more loot ? Can we have random coop with people in single player. This will be amazing. Also can we have autorun so that we dont need to Press W for a lot of time? Can we have some settlements to do quests and maybe even have a npc companion. This game is the ultimate game and need to be TRIPLE A !  Please improve this game like hell. I will support it! This game does not need any RPG elements it already has ! It just needs more NPC's and settlements etc. Think about having a story or something! Think about having bases and gather gear their etc. Please please please please focus on Single Player! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this game is amazing ! Make it coop let it have bases quests and stuff. Make bandits and etc! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE If this game is like that and its like 1000 dollars i would pay 3000 just because its legendary!There is no singleplayer survive game like this! Please make it coop with random people some people dont have friends to play with:):)  Can we have markers when we see a loot close by! Also can we have a guide or something please:)Thanks for the developers for creating a such a good game ! They just gave us a legendary game! Thanks a lot for the good work!

Because it gives me that feeling that my actions actually matters when it comes to my character: Run around with tons of clothes on? You risk hyperthermia. Eat too much? You can expect your character to throw up. The micromanagement of the metabolism system is simply too good to pass on. :) the amount of details that there is	 if you know where to look	 is incredible. Graphic wise	 this is one of the most beautiful survival games I have played in a long time. But yes	 I do play on a 1080ti. On official servers	 the game seem to suffer of some memoryleak after a while. But private servers seems to be handling it better. :) also	 desync seems worse on official servers. But again	 the game is barely a week old. I have faith. The mechs surrounding the military areas are..err...was	 before they got nerfed due to CrySquad(tm)	 quite scary and really gave me a run for the money. But they are being buffed again	 it seems. Last patch added higher chance for their bullets to hit. The enjoyment you get from the game depends on how you play it. I personally love roaming the fields	 checking out the small houses	 woods	 farms etc. Meanwhile	 the threat of meeting a hostile player is real. :) oh and the puppets are actually dangerous enough if you somehow manage to get overrun. :) The game has a lot set for it	 if you look at the roadmap. Once they implement sickness etc	 that gun you just looted will be worth nothing. Good food	 medicine etc will be the key. Survival. Levelling your skills. Some people will say that it is a clone	 yadda yadda. Other people will say that it is boring because it needs “moaaar gunz!” These people are BR players	 who have a completely different mindset when it comes to survival games. BR games are not survival games. Is SCUM anything like DayZ and Rust?- it definately is NOT:Does DayZ	 Rust	 Just Survive and other survival games have realistic metabolism? No. Do they have advanced mechanics such as awareness versus camoflage/stealth? No.These two things are what easily sets this game aside as a brand new “realistic survival genre” IMO. SCUM has raised the bar	 and I believe it will raise it even higher. I am in this for the long haul. And I am happy to be. :)"

While understanding that it's in the early access stages	 that's not an excuse to release an unfinished game. The servers weren't bad until they did this update yesterday. Now	 playing with friends is next to impossible	 people lag all over the place	 any sort of defending yourself is not going to happen. Playing on a server with 120 ping	 shouldn't result in people teleporting all over the place. Thats a problem and the patch should never have been released if an issue like that occurs. I was going to give this game the benefit of the doubt while it can be fun to play	 especially with friends	 but when you have issues that cause enemy players to lag all over the place	 it causes the element of fun to disappear. Until they fix this issue	 which only occured after the most recent update	 i'm not recommending playing this game."

Totally awesome and nobody has done it this well yet! Good buy tons of replayability even without the content we will receive in updates. Cons: Would be nice if crafting worked alll of the time but sometimes it just doesn't want to work even if you have all the right materials that aren't degraded.  I am playing on RX Vega and the unreal engine looks and performs great with the exceptions of the gradual memory leak	 the fact I can't play longer than 5 minutes without the launch command -sm4	 and the long distance water graphical glitches (bright flashes and flickering).  Up close the water reflections look utterly mesmerizing but farther away than 15 meters they dissapear and are replaced by empty flashing.  This is really the only significant problem for me with the game right now.  Once this is fixed the visuals in this game will be flawless and stunning.  FInal Thoughts: Breath of fresh air.  Have not been this excited about a game in quite a while.  Takes the open world survival multiplayerish genre to a whole other level.  Gameplay feels polished.  Once the graphical glitches are fixed (possibly an amd thing?) and performance issues are fixed this will be one of the best games on steam.  Absolutely stunning visuals. Support these developers so they can fix stuff and add content."

The developers even spiced up the old zombie-survival formula by adding giant mechs to military zones. They are putting out daily patches for issues at launch and if they can keep it up through the early access process	 SCUM will become the best open world survival game."

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I am looking forward to the base fortification system (and vehicles) because I don't much like running for endless loot without a base set up. I think the game has a ton of potential and the developers seem serious about the game (they are passionate based on what I've read and seen	 with regards to feedback with the community over the past couple of years). If you've got the spare moola (it's really not expensive)	 I'd buy the game	 even if just to support the devs. What is in the game seems decent (the detailed survival mechanic is great) but is bare bones when you compare to what they promise the game to be. But it is only a few days into EA. Definitely going to revisit. Overall	 a promising start. I recommend it to people who are fans of survival fps but would hold back until the game's a little fleshed out (for people who don't like long stretches of walking simulator)."

Now to get to the point	 don't get it in the current state	 apparently they just hyped the game up without actually making sure that the features present in the first release are actually working and stable	 but I guess that's what you get when your testers all have dedicated streaming PCs with gaming rigs that have 8700Ks and 1080TIs	 so don't get fooled by the streamers. Actually	 take the streamers as reference	 check Shroud's stream	 he gets 140fps in the main menu	 then while in the game he can't keep a constant 60	 imagine the performance for people with less than top notch PCs. Check a CLIP from Sacriel's stream where he says the netcode is literally 0/10 after he got killed when already being out of cover	 this was clipped today 30/08/2018 at around 2:40 PM GMT (the link has a string of characters that was censored by steam - > https://clips.twitch.tv/UglyPrettyDragonflyItsBo♥♥♥♥ime the hearts come from the string B O S H Y (Time))Between the game crashes and the server crashes and restarts you won't even get a smooth 2 hour experience to at least miss the refund period and that is not even the end of it. The optimization is crap	 the character creation is very limited at the moment	 most of the skils are not even in the game and the ones that are will most likely be reworked over and over again	 the shooting mechanics are absolutely attrocious while the desync and teleportation of the mobs and players plus the wanky hitboxes and animations make accidental team kills a very possible outcome especially since the melee attacks are not worth using because of the aforementioned reasons.No	 I do not recommend this game in its current state	 unless you're keen on paying for being a QA tester which I'm tired of with all these early access games that are released in this format over and over again in the past few years. What I do recommend is wait untill this game actually gets some content going for it and then buy it so that it doesn't pull off a Dayz as well.As I could actually find a working private server	 yes	 I did play the game and covered most of the crafting and looting that could be done in that hour	 since I've watched enough streams and youtube videos since the NDAs for the content creators were lifted so I knew what to do and where to go. The vaulting	 hunting and metabolism mechanics are well done	 but the combat itself is way too finnicky and ruled by desync. Can't wait to see more fixes applied to the game and maybe even more content	 and I will gladly update my review to the present thoughts about it at that time so that I offer it a fair chance and fair reviews.For all the ""fanboys"" out there accusing me of somehow sabbotaging the score of the game	 relax	 breathe in	 breathe out. If you enjoy the game so much	 play it	 if it gets better the reviews are 100% going to flip around	 but don't you dare attack	 insult and mock me for my views just because you personally enjoy the game in its current state.Yes	 I did buy an Early Access game	 but just because I did does not mean that I can not leave a review on steam on it	 it is not immune to critique. I	 just like you wish for this game to be a success since it does have potential and some interesting mechanics	 but I want it to be done properly and maybe sometime in the future get rid of the ""Early Access laggy game"" stigma/meme. For now	 I will tell people that if they want an enjoyable experience	 they will not find it here and not now and that is the truth just like you guys admitted over and over again with your Early Access comments so I don't see where all the outrage comes from. They should be fully aware of what to expect even from an Early Access game as most maybe will not.The verdict is the same as with any other early access survival game on the market	 wait untill you actually see results and then support the devs. Steam is not kickstarter	 we are not here to fund your attempts	 we are here to enjoy ourselves in our very limited spare time. The potential is there	 now let's actually see some hard work to actually prove that it can be reached."

Can truly say at launch this is the most polished early access game I have ever played and almost all I play is early access games. The devs have came through on every promise they've made so far and the game looks and runs beautifully for me. 60 FPS on Epic settings on a 1060. For $20 you won't get a better game anywhere. Haven't personally ran into any bugs yet in 15 hours of gameplay and no hackers whatsoever thus far and all the features work fluidly. One warning though is SCUM has an incredibly intricate and realistic metabolism system that can be very overwhelming if you aren't into that kind of thing. Everything you put into your body matters and everything you do has an affect on yourself so be warned this isn't a walk in the park survival game but I digress.Buy SCUM and you will never regret it.

I was very disappointed in this game	 again scavange scaange scavange for what? nothing... even the events you dont take your gear in there so your starting over... your character is stuck on 1 server so you cant jump and play with friends... it just feels.. hallow without any REAL originality that	 lets say matters.. having to go to the bathroom is interesting on a development standpoint	 but it adds nothing but an anoyance to the gameplay.if you wanna buy a game and are trying to figure out between DAYZ and this... buy this... if you have DAYZ.. dont buy this"

I mean its further along than DayZ already and as long as the dev team keeps their passion this game has huge potential. -Couple things that need to be fixed/worked on - -Base building needs to be implemented ( highest priority in my opinion ) player base would increase substantially and it would give us something to work twords ! -Crafting system needs to be reworked (It is currently utter sheet in my opinion) -go build a shelter you'll understand --Its easier to find a gun and some ammo than it is to find a damn apple. ( The problem here is why would i waste time trying to use the survival system when i can run to X	 get geared to the teeth and start pvping ) This gives it more of a battle royal feeling.. - The game needs a nerf big time	 loot wise.. You can go to ""X"" and get geared to the teeth. These places are literally one stop shops and what do you do then? It's not challenging enough. -We need smarter AI 	 The mechs need to have free range within their proximities -We NEED more players per server. 64 players is not enough for this size of a map -A lot of areas are desolate	 you'll spend ALOT of time running through open fields -Characters stats need to be nerfed	 i love having the customization as a fresh spawn but you give us way to much wiggle room. - Armour needs a buff	 you'll be decked out and still get one tapped by a 9x18 round - Why is it so difficult to craft a damn fire - Running down a slope your character can take fall damage - we need more wildlife varients (rabbits	 squirells	 ect ) (Add traps	 fishing	 ect) - Please dont put vehicles in this game (personal preference) in H1Z1 if you had a car you ran the map it's utter bs...- Add a compass - Spawning on your squad	 or in a specific sector is bs- Create radioactive zones	 or minefields	 where only the good loot spawns. I want to feel accomplished.I have many more suggestions	 but damn for 20$$ usd	 get this game! Support the devs and lets make the survival genre great agian. I love hardcore survival games	 but currently this is no where near hardcore. It's great you implemented all of those mechanics but... i don't need to worry about them because of how easy you guys have made it. Give me a challenge	 make me think twice about going around the mechs	 do something!"

The cool graphics wore off and now all I'm left with is a game were I accumulate as little as possible because I know I'm probably going to be dead after a 1/2 hour of trying to get junk and weapons. EVERYONE just kills each other now - but here is the kicker: unlike similar games like Fortnite or PUBG	 after getting killed you spawn in with people who are FULLY LOADED with weapons and ammo. Imagine playing PUBG and at the start the enemies have all the weapons - that is SCUM. No one says hi or tries to work together like they maybe wanted this game to be. I've been sniped without hearing anyone 3 times now and I didn't even have sh!t on me yet. I'm really glad this game only cost me $20 because it's not worth any more than that and I doubt I'll continue to play it.Previous Review....I'm new to PC gaming and just recently had a gaming rig built up. This is my first big graphics-intensive game and I gotta say I'm enjoying the hell out of it.I really don't understand what some of the negative reviewers were expecting out of an early access game? Have they gotten that spoiled? This game has AMAZING graphics	 environment	 and plenty of exploring to do. I think the graphs for your body functions are really cool	 and hey I've never took a dump in a video game so that was a first! Yes	 things could be explained better or more resources	 but I'm not struggline that bad and am a total newb at these types of games.First guy I met in the game killed me with a spear from behing. The next I met was a couple people in a city and they were all really friendly and helpful.This game is TOTALLY WORTH the 20 bucks it costs right now."

First and foremost	 I experienced little to no lag	 crashes	 or even server disconnects in the multiplayer and it is day one! I know half of the playerbase has dealt with lag	 crashing	 and disconnects	 but atleast for me everything worked perfectly with some exceptions. In general	 this game is hard and really unforgiving. You can get killed by bullets almost instantly	 zombies will chase you forever	 and the only way to get good loot in this game is either steal it or raid military bases which are guarded by mechanized robots and tough zombies. The weather	 graphics	 and weapons all are pretty top notch	 the balancing seems to be fine so far and frankly the gameplay is addicting. To sum SCUM up it is a open world survival game. There are many means to surviving such as creating shelter	 meeting allies	 canibalism	 etc. Everything when it comes to survival itself is top notch mechanic wise such as keeping track of your metabolism	 how you do not have to eat every 2 minutes (take notes ark and rust)	 and how the looting is really rewarding and consistent. Right now	 in the games current state I would say it surpasses DayZ by a small margin	 but from what the developers have been showing constantly and hopefully are willing to commit to is a lot of future updates. There is much more I could explain about the game	 but I would rather get back to playing it then wasting breath."

If you ever loved DayZ at any point in it's embarrassing development	 SCUM is a must for you. The Unreal 4 Engine runs so smoothly	 it poops all over the Arma 2/3 Engine(s). Also	 one must remember that this is a hardcore survival game	 and the genre bluntly is just not for everyone. I think a lot of people leave negative reviews instead of just accepting the fact that the game	 and/or genre is just not for them and moving on. Instead they would rather leave a tarnish on the developer's reputation via Steam	 then to be a man and just walk away.

I did not enjoy the game play due to the terrible combat mechanics.  You try to punch a zombie and take 2 hits for each one you put on.  Super slow.  You crouch but still are detected.  You search for items at a rate <50% of finding anything.  I was so frustrated that I decided not even play it.  Very frustrating at this point.

(I have an i7	 GTX 950	 12GB Ram	 and SSD.)Combat was a laughable freeze/stutterfest for me. On the lowest settings	 I have 5-10 FPS IN THE OPENING MENUS and it takes about 1 second for menu to react to my clicks... This is before starting the game up. I play EFT and PUBG on medium settings with pretty smooth gameplay	 so not being able to run this with everything on low is very questionable.Windowed mode (and fullscreen lower than highest res) will make your mouse go to desktop if you scroll too far	 meaning you are dragging items around your desktop instead of clicking in game. Fullscreen for lower than max resolution is broken based on this - at least for me. Haven't seen this in any other game	 and I have 15 on steam.In terms of gameplay	 hard to figure out what the hell is going on and what we should be doing in-game. No guidance whatsoever. Got some laughs out of how badly it ran on my PC. I felt that streamers were not fully transparent or lacked knowledge on how poorly this will run on a PC that costs under 1k."

Looting bodies could use some work. Raiding military zones and evading the robots and learning their pathing is dope. Food system is pretty cool.

Your players will do everything you dont think they will be able to do faster than you dont think they will be able to do it. 2. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HACK YOUR GAME.

513710	53	5	76561198300444829	69	1	-1	7.5	August 30	 201	"How I got SCUMmedLike the majority of the playerbase	 I was hooked on by a hype-train. Constant advertising of features on Youtube and game-sites	 many bigtime streamers like Shroud	 Forsen and Doc were streaming the game all week before the official release. It was hard to avoid this game. This is how a modern gaming business works	 it's acceptable	 too many games are released nowadays and you have to use very aggressive marketing so the people will know about your product. Howbeit	 if you put the game on a market and charge money for it	 you have to make it to be at least somewhat playable	 even if it is an Early Access. In the current state it's absolutely not. Everything needs a rework : A.I of NPCs	 looting system	 ballistics and shooting	 optimisation	 wallhack mechas	 hit-reg	 blinking from place to place players and other generic problems of a lazy game. The map is bland and unfinished boring acid-green greek island with copy-paste buildings with like 2 or 3 patterns of interior design. Rework	 rework	 everything needs to be reworked. Not ""improved"" or ""fixed""	 but wiped out from existence and coded properly from the start. That's a lotta time. Talking about years if this is a 14 people indie studio. And we have reports of the first hackers	 of course	 so the devs have to make a proper anti-cheat	 PUBG wishes them good luck	 Unreal Engine 4 has more holes than... well	 nothing even remotely has that much holes as Unreal Engine 4.In the positive section of reviews the people are writing wordtrash like ""You can take a dump from the cliff""	 ""You can kill a dude and then pee on his face haHAA 10/10"" or ""This is DayZ killer R.I.P"". Being able to poop	 vomit and to eat humans	 or the ability to become wet in rain of course is innovative AF and we clearly haven't seen it before. And you are right	 this a better copy of another scam game. This game tries too hard to be a DayZ killer	 shouting loudly ""Look at me! I have metabolism and stats! Yeet survival and craft! And I'm cheaper!"" but yet constantly failing at everything else that his big brother has. Shooting	 map	 loot	 you get me. Detailed character health bar is another way to make the game look ""complex"". My char is breathing and has a pulse	 now that's convinient. The stamina bar is all you need. Crafting is pointless since you can just loot airport and get decent weapon and armour	 instead of wasting time on making useless melee weapons and clothes. Forest survivalists will be just shot down by military looters	 and yes	 vomitted in their face. Devs wasted couple of years coding those questionable features	 and advertising them all the time instead of adding them in the last place	 and making the game playable in first. Because it must be different from DayZ	 to be something brand new for the sales	 and only because of that. And the annoying hunger	 the char has to eat everything in the vicinity all the time or his energy will go down the bottom and you won't be able to even walk without stops	 so you literally turn into enraged combine that devoures everything and everybody in sight	 like stop being hungry	 man	 just stop. If you are hungry 24/7 like some last stage diabetes patient	 and have you have to eat tons of food	 you are inside of a modern realist survival game. I can't even refund it	 because I was with the other lucky players who tried it on release	 so it took me more than 2 hours to actually play the game without crashing every minute. Well fk it	 20 bucks are dust.BTW the char in the poop animation smears♥♥♥♥♥♥over his lips after wiping his dupa	 that's pretty much describes my experience of playing this game. Eh	 keep on waitin guys	 it will be a great game some day. But that's an uninstall for me."

I have never reviewed any games before and can't really be asked to either	 but I felt compelled to drop a review for this game. Not sure how these people claiming to have ""GTX 1080's"" and then say they get 15 frames make any sense	 considering I have a 970 and am running at around a constant 50fps and rarely ever dip below that. Either you don't know how to put a computer together or you haven't updated your drivers since 1992.

513710	23	3	Kayron_	200	6	1	26.2	September 2	 201	"First off	 Don't buy this product if you're someone who likes to play finished games I would think people would be smart enough to know that these days with early access becoming more prominent for smaller Dev teams so if you're that type of person avoid this title and pay full price when the game goes full release.so far the Devs have been pretty proactive fixing issues so hopefully that means the major issues will be addressed soon.The biggest being the current Dsync (reminds me of ARMA  but worse sometimes) which can hopefully be fixed over the next couple of weeks as it will improve the game a lot as the deathmatch game modes can be quite fun (Hopefully the Devs disable the drone for people in that gamemode as it gave me away when it was night time for one of the maps)Ultrawide support is something that was meant to be in for EA which is there but not tweaked correctly although it looks like a fix is coming soon.Unfortunatlly the Devs nerfed the Mechs which is something I don't think needed changing however it just makes it easier to get loot than it already was	 making mechs slower/turn slower would have been a better nerf in my opinion.all in all i think $20 is a fair price for this survival EA game as it's great if you like running around looting with the occasional player interaction and the option to play some event gamemodes (although respawns need improving)soz grammar nazis I cbf checking this."

I really enjoy the survival and crafting elements. Due to having an old computer this game is hard to run and lags quite a bit so until that gets fixed with a new computer and game patches I will have to wait to play multiplayer.

Anyone who loves survival games and are done with the ""Rust"" bs of the devs ♥♥♥♥ing the game up	 ""Dayz"" to advansed in a way to where You cant have much fun	 and the ""arma"" two cars touch tips and the game breaks to all♥♥♥♥♥♥ type games. The game has a LOT of potential especially for just being released.Cons:Friend system- Friends are something I personally find big in games like these	 I can't speak for others. This game in my opinion from what iv gathered doesn't do a really good job at helping friends get together besides venture for 6 hours cause your guy has never ran a day in his damn life.Food system- The system is really well implemented and I love the screens that come along with the whole eating healthy part. However I think its a bit over the top that in about a 10 min span my guy kept getting hungry and needing water. Might be a way to balance the game however it kinda gets on my nerves when the characters fat♥♥♥♥♥cant go 10 min without a candy bar.player performance- There are times when I see another player and I actively wanna go into combat with him/her	 talk	 etc. however the player base just seems kinda laggy. I get it. game just came out. but still its a bit strange to see such ""lag"" i guess i could say in other players.There are some other things wrong with the game but a lot of rights. For a game that just came out I really do think it's headed in the right path. I just hope that the devs can really take into consideration the food issue and maybe a friend system. Other than that I really do love the game and what it has to offer."

This game leaves me wanting more. I know this is super early in development	 but right now it is a grind at its best. Surviving in this game is not the hard part	 dying and spending 45 minutes running 20km to find your squad-mates and teaming back up is. I have gotten quite proficient at the early stages of this game but the time it takes to learn new skills like crafting ammo I just don't have the patience for.The PVP aspect of the EVENTS in this game are going to be a good time once the desync and framerate are worked out. It is a wecome break from hours and hours of searching for enough ammo to fill a magazine. I know the point of this game is to just survive	 but there is not end in sight while playing. I need a goal to be kept interested. The goal of this game right now is to just exist.This is a fun game with tense moments but it is extremely repetitive. Playing with friends makes it better	 but it is still the same thing over and over.A little tip: If you want to craft ammo make sure your pistol and rifle skills are at medium. If your squad is to be successful	 make sure you have a brawler	 a crafter	 and a healer.I recommend this game as a time killer (I've killed almost 30 hours) but I don't think there is a lot of repaly value.I hope the developers continue to grow this game	 fix the bugs	 memory leaks	 and get the FPS up beyond 70 or 80 without me having to set my own start paramaters in Steam. When vehicles	 aircraft	 and other crafting skills are added I see this being like an open world PUBG that takes time	 patience	 and skill."

513710	0	0	f34rcon77	127	4	1	46.8	August 30	 201	"SCUM is a game that strives to beat Dayz at it's own game....And so far	 its go the best chance at doing so than any other survival game ever released. The game is decently optimized for some	 not so much for others. Optimization aside	 there were quite a few server issues at launch (as you should expect) and the devs managed to resolve most of them in a single day. Some people are still having some server lag issues but personally its been smooth as butter for me. For the gameplay loop....well picture Dayz or Miscreated. Its the same type of game so expect the same type of experience. These games will probably always have mixed reviews because they are dubbed as ""Walking Simulators"" due to the slow paced natue. You spawn	 you loot	 you kill and you eventually die. That death will be heartbreaking after investing hours into a character but it really makes you think twice before taking a shot or running at the zombies. Now lets talk pros and cons.Pros:Notably the most beautiful open world zombie survival game to date. No seriously	 the game is gorgeous. Animations are the best in the genre. From vaulting to swimming and all the way to chopping up a corpse	 this game does animations right. Speaking of vaulting....You can parkour	 climb over fences	 and even climb through windows - fluidly and with ease...unless your character is fat.The metablism system - Watch as every bite you takes traverses your digestive system. The game will track every nutritional value I have ever heard of...its actually pretty damn fascinating. The impact of the metabolism system however does not seem to be fully implemented yet. The puppets	 aka the zombies - They are relatively smart but rarely ever glitch through walls. You can strip whatever they are wearing and take it for yourself and even chop up and eat them...if your into that.The Mechs - OP as ♥♥♥♥ and thats a good thing. You will find several of them patrolling every high loot area in the game. They are no joke! If you see one looking at you then either run or hide or you will defintely die.Wildlife - Decently implemented. There seems to be a nice variety as well. Hunting - Major plus for me! Today I shot a horse in the neck with a .22. From there I tracked it by following the blood on the ground to find it on the ground dead near a tree line. From there I skinned it (and btw it even has a texture for skinned animals which is super cool)	 chopped it up	 and ultimately ate it. Horses make a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of steak! Oh yea....and by the way...humans can be tracked with these same methods!Map Design - Jaw droppingly beautiful. As I have said the game is gorgeous. The map could use a big city though to change the pace up a bit	 but aside from that 10/10Sound - Good so far but I honestly havent been able to get in enough gunfights yet to really judge it. The ambient sounds are great though!Now...for the cons!Optimzation. Although I have it running decently I am seeing people with much better hardware getting 30fps. I know its EA  but I this definitely needs to be improved on. Loot economy - I come from Dayz...where everything is a struggle. The loot economy on this game is decent but the balance between military gear and civilan gear is pretty bad right now. Its too hard to loot up on basic gear and too easy to loot up with full military gear. The devs should try to balance it out more and give a incentive to actually explore outside of military bases. Map Design - the bad part. The forests and mountains are beautiful	 as is the ocean. But....there are practically no big towns and cities like in Dayz. This may cause the game to get stale for people after a while. UI - Functional but not properly expliained. Some key features are missing as well such as the ability to tell if your gun is in semi or automatic firing mode. Devs have already commented on Reddit and made it clear that they are going to add that however. Melee - Now dont get me wrong	 melee feels great! But	 it also takes way too much to kill a character in melee. Server Stability - Its been good for me but I still see some people here and there complaining about teleporting players. You can expect this to most likely be completely resolved in the coming days / weeks. Final Verdict - In my eyes this game can be the Dayz killer. It has all the potential and some aspects are already better. The game is a solid 8/10 for me. Its worth its cost currently and I would advise picking it up now for 20.00 USD before its more complete and the price gets increased. If you like Dayz	 then buy this game and buckle up. If you dont like Dayz you probably wont like this."

I like this game a lot	 I've been wanting one of this genre type for awhile that isn't Day Z	 which I haven't played due to the negative reviews. For an Early Access game	 it runs really good. I can't see my frame counter for some reason but I get at least 60-70 FPS if I were to guess. Frame drop here and there but not anything that I would get loud about. Crashes every once in a while but not as much as Skyrim. Zombies have the rare ability to glitch through walls but not entire hordes. It's happened to me personally no more than 5 times across multiple play sessions. The loot definitely needs tweaking anywhere that isn't a military base. My buddy has a rented server that we play on	 therefore I haven't experienced these claims of hackers and cheaters. Getting your own server and then populating it the proper way to go about experiencing this game. Also if you're not a hot tempered rage monster who freaks out about everything will also be good for a positive experience. ***For those with Ultra wide monitors	 2560x1080 resolution does exist	 but it gets cut off on the bottom which runs into issues with crafting cuz you have to switch it to regular 1080. These are very minor issues which do not ruin the game for me personally	 and it shouldn't for you either. I think this game is pretty dope for what it is in its current form. Especially for only 20 bucks. Buy this game and support the devs. They got some cool stuff coming."

Everybody loves bashing Zombie Brains!- Crafting is diverse. many weapons and usefull items to choose from.- Party or Group system so you can team up with friends.***Cons*** - There is no Base Building as to make a permanant domicile	 or place to hunker down and be safe. only small tent where you're still vulnerable to bears	 zombie's	 and of coarse	 other players	 who more than ever want to clobber pown your face off. - Inventory space is crap. you can't carry♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need supplies to make your first ( yet way too ♥♥♥♥ing small ) backpack and have nowhere to put them. i understand that it is survival but if it feels like real life	 i already have one of those. im not going to play another one on the pc. 2nd and 3rd backpacks equally as small. still garbage and are forced to carry some items such as cooking pot	 sledgehammers	 etc... back to your way too unguarded non-permanent shanty	 that inevitably is going to be found	 and or looted while your out looking for a saw	 thread	 sewing kit	 or any needed item that you keep having to run back to a town for. - In my opinion this game needs base building. even if it were klunky such as Miscreated's base building some sence of security WHATSOEVER would be great. - And we cant leave out the Jogging. their metabolism system is SO precise that your set in a world with little to no food or water	 always starving	 and never have any stamina to get anywhere or run from multiple zombies for more than 6 seconds. they need to make the metabolism slower	 to allow a little less precision. giving you more running time	 and more time to find fresh food / water. so again. this isnt a negative review. merely critisizm of where the game is and my reaction to it. Yes i would recommend buying it to experience Scum for yourself but on the same coin i wish they had a few more things fixed than they do. i was under the impression they were a lot farther along than this from video's of devplay and twitch play. i really feel like im playing an early Miscreated here. minus the city's	 vehicles	 diverse weapons	 base building and readily available food/water"

Be prepared to do a lot of traveling in game	 the map is huge and with resouces spred over this distance you won't be in any one place long. There are some tweaks needed for inventory management and combat	 it is in early access so go into this expecting to find things that need changing. It is a lot of fun with friends	 finding them can be a challenge as you all spawn on different parts of the map. If you spawn a long way from your friend you will play a fair time solo as you will need to survive before you get to each other. The game is cool and I can recomend it."

The melee combat doesnt make you want to scream at the top of your lungs and punch your monitor. The metabolism system is incredibly realistic without being overly important to survival. The Zombies dont hit you from 10 feet away or run through doors or walls to get you. SCUM rewards you for being a good survivor by letting you spend ""fame points"" to spawn near your squad or region if you die. I very much look forward to where SCUM goes with future support... it might just be the survival game we have all been waiting for..."

I followed the development of this game for a very long time. It has always seemed incredibly ambitious and that generally makes people feel one of two things(or both)	 excitement and or concern. Concern because many games with far less ambition than this have failed terribly in their execution. This game is NOT one of them.The game currently has limited content	 but the content it does have is so solid. The combat is new feeling	 expanded and while at first	 seemingly a bit tedious	 the mechanics of combat actually offer more in terms of combat preference and play style than most other games. I have had shootouts with groups of players(and hordes of zombies attracted to the sound)	 Melee weapon fights with random strangers and one time even a fist fight that started with a guy throwing a soda bottle at my head. The lock on system for boxing makes manuverability an ease	 being able to dodge left and right	 weave	 punch	 jab	 kick.The Metabolism system at first glance seems overly complicated but in reality is super easy to understand and manage without feeling like you're caught up on micro managing constantly and really has a simple pattern of proper execution that is easy to follow and repeat	 however	 if you prefer to not bother with the intricacies of what you consume	 you wont suffer a large disadvantage for just eating any old thing when hungry. Repetitive eating will mean your whole body is constantly churning out energy	 by keeping your stomach and intestine full or at least not empty. But dont forget to poop or pee! Preferably from somewhere high like a radio tower or on the corpse of a fallen enemy.The amount of gear and the variety of each type is already so extensive	 even in the games infant stages.PROSLots of geargreat execution of mechanicsextreme detail has gone into game design so farSolo and MP are both funSurvival is done wellHUGE mapCombat is well done with many stylesJumping	 vollying	 dodging	 vaulting.Gear design is well done	 even down to rocks and sticks.Crafting is easy when the basics are learned.CONSThe game is still early in development♥♥♥♥ing Hackers.(new anti cheat was introduced today. I'll update thius con depending on my experiences with the new anticheat)The usual EA bugs EA limited contentAll in all	 the EA release of this game has shown the great length the devs are willing to go to in order to bring to life their full vision	 and shown that no idea is TOO ambitious with the right amount of work	 time and execution. While the content is still limited	 the effort that has gone into to released content is shaping up to be a great precursor for the direction and quality of the overall game and I think that is one BIG detail people have mostly overlooked.I wholeheartedly recommend backing this game in early access."

Most players spawn	 run to airfield and collect end-game loot and then they're off to kill or to just survive.The crafting system is easy to get used to as its easy and user friendly.Now lets talk zombies	 in this game zombies are everywhere	 but they are pretty scattered so you wont see more than 4 in a pinpointed area. Whenever you see a zombie	 you dont really feel threated at all	 as fighting them is pretty easy and dieing to a zombie is pretty hard. Now what could be improved is the zombie threat-level	 because as of now they are nothing but walking closets with gear for players.Improve this:Place a lot more zombies on the map	 increase their damage	 basically make the zombies a real threat.I know this is an early access so im not going to go into getting more content for the players after they have loot	 but yeah as of now when u have all the loot you can get	 you just run around trying to kill animals	 zombies or other players	 none of which will reward you anything of value as you already have endgame loot.Servers are to small 64 players on a map as big as this one is not really fulfilling. (took me 1 hour of gameplay to find another player with a full server.5/10 as of now."

Single player... crash upon load. Multiplayer... crash upon spawn in... Doesn't seem to matter where I put the graphical settings I can't reach 60 fps and it constantly utilizes 99% of my GPU in a system with 16GB ram	 i7-8700k and GTX 1080... The mechanics were good	 the detail in the metabolism tracking was crazy in depth despite not being fully functional yet	 even at low frame rate the graphics looked good too. I can deal with some poor optimization	 but an inability suddenly to even run the game is beyond frustrating. It's too bad	 this game was shaping up to be everything Day-Z tried to be for so many years. For now I'm unimpressed	 but my review might change if I can ever get in the game again and put some more time in. For	 maybe hold on to your money until they work more kinks out."

513710	0	0	webtwenty	111	9	1	6.4	September 5	 201	"I haven't played this game very much	 however I have played enough to see how the combat works	 how the engine itself works	 etc. The looting mechanic clearly needs some work with the occasional disappearance of items	 but other than that for early access it is very well put together. Joining servers with low pings doesn't matter because on multiple occaisons of chasing or being chased by people the other people would dissapear to reapear in slightly different areas	 however I have not had this issue when both parties are participating in combat. I also feel as though the mechs should recieve a slight nerf. The spotting range is quite further than one would first believe and they do insane amounts of damage including with the police vest on. The stealth skill seems to do nothing for this. Besides all this the game is still a lot of fun and much better than the counter parts such as Day Z. This game is easily worth the $20 if not more."

With the current content	 the game is similar to Escape from Tarkov mixed with basic survival mechanics of food and water.However	 the devs are clearly working incredibly hard on this game	 coming out with updates every one to two days. I imagine that a lot of the promised content will be coming to scum within the next 3-6 months and will provide for a much more fulfilling experience."

I like the game for the most part.... however	 They have a long way to go until the game is decently polished. It is plauged by bugs like zombies glitching through walls	 servers crashing constantly	 mechs getting stuck	 lag and desync beyond pubg	 the list goes on. That being said	 the game is early alpha and these things are to be expected. What truely worries me is not two weeks in to the games release	 I already have issues with the newest update. The mechs were	 in my opinion	 already a little OP. They made the game very frustrating in the first place as you would loot up for an hour after spending 20 minutes to get to the loot	 only to be murdered by a mech that saw you through a crack in a wall. Now the mechs see you from further	 hear you better and are causing me to seriously contomplate putting the game down and possibly returning it. If your cool with endlessly looting just to die to A.I. go for it but if thats not your cup of tea	 then I dont think it is worth the 20 bucks."

513710	0	0	ErfWerm	45	8	1	48.1	August 30	 201	"Buy this game.Ok... so...This game is in Alpha. There are multiple notices on this page	 on the developers page	 and even in game to remind you of this. Anyone that writes a review and talks negatively about the bugs in an alpha game is the same kind of person that would lick an electric fence after reading a sign not to. Avoid these people.Ignore all negative reviews that talk about bugs or lack of content in any alpha game. Do your homework.With that said	 lets talk about the game.A lot of people are saying its like DayZ. Ive never played DayZ	 so this might be possible. A lot of people are saying its like PUBG. I have played PUBG	 and its similiar in the sense that your in a large area looking for loot	 but thats pretty much it. This is not a run and gun game. Its not even a BR game. Its a survival game	 and it takes that aspect to the extreme.Starting the game	 you are brought into your typical character creation screen. I know there is a promo video that goes over this	 so i wont spend much time on it. Some of the options to customize your character are currently greyed out. Im assuming at later patches	 these options will be available. Playing the game is much different than any other game ive ever played before. This game takes SURVIVAL	 and really goes nuts with it. You have to watch your calorie intake	 make sure your getting enough vitamins and minerals	 hydration	 oxygen levels	 holy crap.. you will feel like you have a medical degree once you play a few games. If this sort of monitoring bothers you	 do not buy this game	 because its pretty much the biggest part. If you have ever spent some time in the hospital	 and you have been hooked up to all the machines	 this is pretty much your life now. Minus the bed. Buy this game.Let me walk you through my last spawn. Be me. Spawn into a new world wearing nothing but an orange jumpsuit. With the help of some guides online and some people in my channel	 i took off my clothes and was able to make an improvised backpack	 and a spear. So far so good. I hope it doesnt rain. Run run run... loot loot loot. I must of searched about 20 houses. Came up empty in most. Finally found a pickaxe	 and some other small tools. On the way to one of the houses	 I was running up the street and right in the middle of the street looking at me.. was another player.I'm not sure how long he saw me coming	 but he just stood there and didn't move. I stopped. I walked slowly towards him	 and he drew his gun and aimed it at me.  I dropped to a prone position	 used in-game chat	 and simply said ""hey man	 you can do what you want here	 but im unarmed and wont offer much if you kill me"". He put his gun away	 gave me some food	 and continued on his way. Again	  this is the type of game this is. This might not be every interaction	 and quite honestly	 if I had a gun	 i might of shot him. lol. I'm willing to bet he didnt even have any bullets	 but just like in real life	 i dont know this	 and treated it like he did. At any point in this game	 you might come across someone who might just shoot you in a face. You might loot for 4 hours	 and then you run around a corner smack into a robot	 and your gone. This is SCUM.Buy this game.People hate on this game for a number of reasons. The game has bugs	 will kick you from the servers	 and will probably give you high lag spikes. Your probably gonna loot for 30 mins	 and a bear will eat you. Melee combat sucks right now. Fighting a zombie	 and your probably gonna lose or take enough damage that you will bleed out and die. Your gonna loot 30 hours	 find a shovel	 a can of cat food	 a pair of shoes	 and maybe... if your lucky	 an olive or 2. Once you do find a gun	 if you find a gun	 good luck finding ammo. Unlike other games	 guns and ammo arent in the same place. You gotta find it. However	 i will say this. Guns can be a GREAT tool to persuade others with. They dont know its not loaded	 and because people spend so much time finding the useless crap they have	 no one wants to die like that. Squad play is sort of a joke right nw. You can join the same server as your friend	 use discord and coordinate where to meet up. The map is so huge	 and with no vehicles	 it can take FOREVER to get somewhere. Oh	 did i mention zombies and bears and other people hunting? Once you find your friend	 you can squad up. When you die	 you have to refind your friend. You might spawn on the other side of the map	 and if you do	 good luck. With that said	 the most fun for me	 when playing with friends	 was trying to meet up with each other. The game does lack content right now. Once you loot	 and find your friends	 the only options are to just look for other people	 loot some more	 or go get murdered by the robocop robots. Lets talk about that for a breif second...Awesome. Its legit a blantent ripoff of the t9000 or whatever it was called from robocop but they are awesome. The videos dont do it justice. I know you saw that robot	 said the same thing to yourself (""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;)	 and wanted to see one right away. They are as awesome as you think they are. The first time i saw one	 he saw me first. I heard it walking. Then	 i heard it say something to be in a robotic voice. I dont remember what it was	 but suddenly my area lit up with a hail of  bullets. I actually survived that fight	 just to die later to blood loss. Remember kids	 heal your wounds. Also	 avoid the friggin airport at all costs	 unless they patch in a rocket launcher at some point.Buy this game."

I understand it it early acces. But it should be atleast playingable to some degree of what is in game	 After all we did pay for it. The Resolution is really bad 2680 by 1080. is zoomed in really bad cant see all the items. Everthing that is placed in the world like containers  respawn place. does not stay in the world relog	 and its all gone!!!! Lag the more you play to the point it crashes then all ur work is for nothing. I am runing pretty good spec 2.5k computer. So it should run with no issues. The game has promise	 However at its state at the moment its get old real fast cant keep what is not on you	 die you lose it of course.  No way to store any items in game even thow you can craft storage items they just disappaer. Hug Disappoiment!!! I would get a refund	 But Been more than 2 hrs I wanted to give a real try. Right know Waste of time!!!"

They come in expecting a DayZ like experience	 byt its way more complex than DayZ	 and way more in depth. In SCUM you constantly have to take care of your character. You have to make sure his metabolism is good. You have to vary in your choices of food so you get all the minerals and stuff to get yourself going contra DayZ where you can eat an apple	 drink some water and keep on going. People expect pvp everywhere like in DayZ	 H1Z1	 perhaps Rust	 but thats not what you're gonna get. This game has a very well done and thought out survival system that focuses on the individual players survival in the PVE environment - not the pvp environment (this can and will probably be changed in the future by implementing more weapons and better PVP systems along with better network syncing and performance).People run into military areas expecting mad loots	 they get domed by a mech	 quit the game and write a review not recommending the game. I've had 2 friends do it so far	 so i can safely say that others have done the same. Despite my 10 hours of game time - as of writing this review - i strongly recommend this game if you're up for a challenging DayZ like game that puts you in a very realistic situation when it comes to surviving the harsh elements within the game.As of right now the game is in a Pre-Alpha stage and is missing a lot of content and has many issues. One of the biggest issues right now is Net-Code and network syncronization between all players on the server. I've also noticed that if you chamber a round in a gun without a magazine it tends to just not shoot	 which has lead to a few of my deaths in the game. Overall PVP works	 but is very clunky and not all that enjoyable	 but the devs are well aware of this and are most likely working on it right now.If you want to follow the devopement of the game you can check out their website https://scumgame.com/en follow them on twitter https://twitter.com/ScumGame or watch livestreams on twitch. They only post major updates on the website and smaller updates og Twitter. On twitch you can watch how gameplay progresses and improves over time. One day you might be watching a streamer PVP'ing without any networking issues and so on."

513710	1	0	76561198157932983	89	10	1	31.7	September 2	 201	"I have to recommend this game since it is in Alpha stage and to not recommend it would be unfair even though I have found it very frustrating and almost refunded at the beginning but I did have some fun.  I also bought the supporter edition which gives you a different colour light?  I think	 but even still	 you'll want to cover that with a hat so players don't see you	 same goes for the face tattoo	 you'll be covering it with a mask and hat	 so? kewl 8euros. I will highlight the problems. -If you don't have enough fame points which can be gained by killing zombies	 or farming trees etc	 you won't be able to spawn next to friends or teammates.  You'll have to run for one hour across a map.  Commit suicide and keep trying?  You'll go into negative fame points and be penalised each time and your respawn time will even become longer	 forget the fact you will having to run for 1 hour	 in the dark across a huge map to your friend	 sometimes dying after 30 minutes. -The metabolism system thing just seems over inflated to me at the moment.  I get it	 like	 you eat cereal and get your carbs	 you only eat meat	 you don't.  However I don't really care much for my characters sugar intake or volume of their bowls when I just started to die because I fell 5ft down a hill and I am only able to adminster a bandage once. Which then slow ticks my health. Or a zombie is attacking me and I just click X and prone and he no longer can. -Looting is fun but it seems all the good weapons are in areas controlled by robots	 which is fine	 but they will see you in the pouring rain	 at 3am	 in a bush	 when you're crouching. Cool	 dead again	 another 1 hour run. -You can 'squad up' with a friend but you don't see them on the map and if you logout	 you'll lose this. -Optimisation is terrible and frames can drop to 20 in towns	 or if you chop up a body and you've got a lot of items on the floor.  60fps outside though	 sometimes. Also my resolution is stuck at 1280x720 because when I try change it to 1980x1080 half the screen disappears and I had to go to .ini to manually fix it. -We played on a low populated server but it seems the players just run to the meta-area and take all the weapons and then spawn kill people.-The UI is extremely confusing at first.  So you need to make a backpack which requires 5 sticks and x other items?  Ok so rumage for some stones.  You'll need two stones to make a stone knife.  With your beginner clothes you'll have 2 pockets in your pants and 1 pocket in your shirt.  So you pick them up	 make a knife.  You now need to cut bushes to get sticks.  But you can't carry the sticks in your inventory	 you need to stand over 2-5 of them to craft a 'bundle' of sticks'  Then you carry them in your hand to the next bush and place them on the ground	 hopefully not losing them.   Now you cut the next bush	 it drops 3 sticks	 and you need 5.  Your bundle!  Ok so highlight it and uncraft it so now there are 5 sticks around you on the ground.  Great	 make a 5 bundle and carry them on your back	 you're half way there to making a backpack!  Ahh a boar!   This is the same for making a firepit	 a stick and then trying to cook steaks on it.  It is extremely confusing.  After we finally made a pit	 which kind of was at a 90 degree angle up a fence	 we couldn't cook the steaks until we googled it.  We had to right click the stick	 then highlight the meat and then the firepit said 'cook'  which afterwards didn't even change the name of the meat to 'cooked' so you never know. -As said above the inventory management is a nightmare	 at least at first.  There are certain things you can't even move becuase you can't carry. like a storage box.  So after spending 20 minutes making one	 it randomly spawned at my feet upside down	 I can't move it	 it is in the mdidle of the road	 great. Also imagine you have a axe on your back with a shovel and a gun in your hand.  You'll drop that gun every time you try and climb a ladder.  You'll lose so many items from your hands and not notice. Overall notwithstanding the negative points	 which are to be expected	 I recommend this game and think it has potential.  I had some funny moments with my friend over voicechat while we navigated this new game.  And everything I've said I imagine they're going to intend on fixing!  At least I hope!"

We're coming from DayZ so the controls were similiar and the playstyle similair	 but MUCH MORE HARDCORE!Lots and LOTS of bugs	 but none that made it unplayable. Just a lot more work.- Robot sentries able to shoot through walls/terrain/trees that sort of stuff.- So far the crafting menu is pretty simple. I like the subtly and that everything you need is there. Takes a bit to get use to	 but it's there. - Ladders are awesome	 but when it goes through multiple floors I feel like there should be a way you can get off on a floor and not have gravity push you all the way down. Other than that. Man this game is great and we instantly loved it!"

Combat needs to be more effective PVE as I noticed frustratingly that the zombies (or stimulated corpses) can easily get the player into a stun lock (especially in 3rd person) and can cancel attacks by the player mid-end animation. Also	 I like the BCU damage indicator BUT I don't think getting hit once (even on strength 5) should cause a sickness level 1	 and the re-opening of wounds should not occur after one zombie hit as well (I find myself constinatly patching). Wounds also re-open just as easily when wearing armour as wearing no armour (well	 atleast it feels like that).Can't wait for fixes (and bigger hordes and cool random events)."

I hold up surival games in the anecdotes that you can tell	 here are a few of mine over the last few hours;So I run over too a village and I go into the first building	 looted. I hear footsteps outside and premtively say my hello	 he says it back	 all is peaceful	 I get panicked when I know someone can end me straight away so when we meandered over to the other side of the village there was another guy chopping something up on the floor. Human meat further than you could ever eat spread out like a buffet. I said that cant be good for you to eat because of this games nutrition sytem (which is alot cooler than it sounds) he was like	 nahhh	 its fine. Vomits 2 seconds later. We say our goodbyes.I run across a shooting range when it was getting quite dark and hear movement over in the trees	 again	 i literally was about to say hello and then a gun toting madman fully clothed in camo comes out and shotguns blasts me from about 10 metres away	 63% health. All while these precious seconds are happening I have to be honest	 I was screaming 'Dont shoot! Dont Kill me! DONT KILL ME YOU PRICK!' At that	 the swedish? maybe guy said Ok Ok Ok Im sorry! Im pretty sure I said dont let it happen again in my panic. i survived.I stealthed into the airfield which has mega robocop robots protecting it and as i was making my way up the radar tower	 theres were HEAPS of zombie bodies in a corridoor	 with one closed door .... I dont know why I didnt click until I opened that door	 but a flash a sparks off the doorframe made me **** myself	 8 percent health down from 63	 bled out a few minutes later while laughing with the guy who had killed me.Me and my friend finally met up and we had yet to kill and cook an animal	 these are the ones that we saw in our travels but were unable to kill. Boar	 Goat (That ragdolled my friend) and horse. The horse I shot once in the head and it dropped to the floor	 it however did not die	 it sort of groggily got itself back up and bolted	 we both just watched it stunned. I was a little bit annoyed at my friend for not shooting but he forgot to load is mag with bullets	 anyway the horse ran about 200m and then walked from there and then stopped	 at this point we were about to finish it and it dropped dead. Animals bleed out. This is a simple mechanic that just IS in this game.To summarise	 Day 1	 I've had no graphical issues	 gameplay has blown me away	 core mechanics there	 hidden mechanics to discover	 actually leveling up your character. On this note I have to say to anyone reading	 farm fame points! If you run negative and starve to death you will have to restart	 at this point you would be probably starving so would slowly lose your abilities and learn to lose your stuff if you dont have teammates! A good backup of Fame points could tip the balance if you can instantly respawn on your squadmate. Yeah anyway	 I love this game	 looking forward to whats to come."

Scum is by no means perfect	 there are some severe memory leak issues that needs to be addressed in a timely manner and i have no doubts that they will be. After following this game for the better part of two years i can honestly and happily say that it has lived up to its hype and I look forward for what the future holds ofr Scum."

(also i hears it's like dayz... never played)  i run with the recommended card and i run everything just fine. although i do turn down stuff you would already turn down for reasons we all know.  50-60fps most always.  the survival aspect is good fun but i didn't find it all to difficult.  sometimes you might cut it close but if you keep up with your stats	 listen to your dood when he says he needs stuff	 and actually go search you should be fine. i have engaged every person i have encountered except one or two fresh spawns and the gunplay is pretty decent.  needs a little bit of tweaking probably but it is much better than rust imo.  i have also caught a few shots when i wasn't expecting them and turned the fight to my favor.  the shots to kill varies i assume but it usually feels right.  have not emptied a mag just to be looked at and shot.   im very hopefull the devs deliver on all their promises because this will be the survival winner once that's done."

Players aren't such unsuported kids. You can play and have a little fun.- Cheap. I was expectating a expensive price. ;)Cons:- Robots aim and fires you even if you are inside buildings and the build is all closed. - Robots shoots trepasses a very large metal wall	 like as its firing on an open camp.- Can't filter MP servers. Can't set to filter by players	 ping. Too bad.- Not otimized	 games freezes a lot even with i7 3.5ghz	 16gb ram	 ssd	 gtx 980 ti 6gb- Zombies trepassing walls like ghosts.- You can't create your own server. You don't have acess to servers files. Only if u rent a server for selected hosts with a very high price. All games that i knew using this spirit failed.Still unplayable by now.Im going wait a little more. Buy it if only you have a lot of patience and don't cares much about so many bugs.Im going playing a little more	 and im going update this review.It ISN'T A BAD GAME	 I LIKED IT.But by now it's very unplayable.

I attempted to play two online games both server end up disappering. I dont know If its my issue or the server.Anyway here are the pros and consPros:1.Ture Hardcore gameplay(Many detail that effects your body	weight)2.No third person view advantage(Especially good for royal mode when it comes out)3.boxing system is fun hahahaha.4.Details(Like some items you cant fit in the pocket	 even you have enough slot	 the item will be just to big for the pocket size)5. Very friendly community	 I met few people	 non of them attack me. (Maybe because its just the first day)6.A price that everyone can accept(Interesting concept mixing zombie and robots.)Cons:1. Since the game is realistic	 more animals needs to add in to the game	 for now the game kind of force me to eat human meat since its the only meat I can get(There are animals	 but rare)2.Zombie are a liitle bit too hard to kill once they see you	 every zombie has the ablity to charge(May be change it to the thin zombie can charge	 but the fat one cant). A adjustable server setting needs to gave to the server owner(Not sure if there is one).Since its only the first day for this game	 I'll give it a thumbs up	 the devs really put tons of detail into the game. I will say the hype is worth. It just need more work on some issues	 and keep listening to the cummnity!At the end I'll say this game is above most zombie game I play in the past	 I wont compare this to 7dtd	 they feel too different. But it's above Dayz and miscreated for sure."

513710	0	0	76561198219271689	51	2	1	2.8	August 30	 201	"DISCLAIMER I understand this game has just released and I shouldn't expect much so this is just my opinions. I didn't give much description on how to fix any of the problems I listed	 I just spoke my mind about the game as a consumer.Played this game for three hours and ran for two and a half of that. Can't tell on the map the difference between a town	 a military outpost	 or a shack. Got into two fights	 the first I got shot in the head and took 30~ damage	 then shot the guy in the legs and instantly killed him... then I got triple teamed within 3 minutes of rejoining (don't log out in a police station). Looting reminds me of of H1Z1 going house to house searching inventory	 and finding items on the ground. At the police station the same type of items spawned in the same ""lootable inventories""	 such as the mp5	 shotgun	 and mp9 all spawning in the same laudable. This helps with remembering where items can spawn	 but makes it a high priority support and makes most of the outskirts of towns	 or shacks pointless to loot.Inventory is not completely disappointing	 but	 after watching 10 of the videos on the steam page and one speficifly on ""improved game mechanics that other other games failed on"" then having it to where you have to put on someone else inventory to look inside of it isn't the best message. (I'm saying this because as a new player without getting help haven't found a way to look into backpacks people drop without putting them on)Another problem I had was I couldn't have a pistol in my holster and swap it in-between my 2 holsters and my hand. what I mean by	 this is my shotgun	 rifle	 and mp5 all swapped perfectly	 but when I found out I was only able to hold my pistol and if I swapped to a shotgun I would drop it I was kind of disappointed.crafting is complicated since	 I don't know / understand what most of the items either do	 stats are	 or their worth. I mean this as when I first crafted a spear I thought I would be able to throw it by aiming down and left clicking (again	 not sure if there is a way	 but I didn't find one) Next	 I got into a fight and I had a spear that I made and almost got 1 shot by someone with a sledge hammer. I expected a spear to work like in Rust with a thrust animation instead of a swing and that almost got me killed. (example of not knowing what items do) Lastly	 I'm not sure if a crafted items better than a found one or if an axe is better than a pickaxe. items in games change depending on how the creators want them to be used and handled so I believe they should add a way for players to know the tiers of weapons	 (I heard them talk about in a video	 but it wasn't listed clearly in the inventory) and if a weapon you find is better than your current one	 or if crating makes the weapon better depending on your character's stats.(one side note is I'm worried about if crafting items is even worth it. by the time I had the ability to craft a spear I had a sledgehammer	 and by the time I had the ability to craft a metal sword (which I expected is the best melee weapon) I had a shotgun.)Again these are just my opinions on the game	 I didn't attempt to solve any of the problems i have stated. i just want this game to be good for the developers and the community.Thank you"

It's not quite as heart-pumping for the reason that I think is random spawns can be anywhere on the map - so there is no Northwest Airfield where you know anyone who manages to make it there has to have SOME kind of gear and can be dangerous - you could be at the highest rare loot area in the game	 and some fresh spawn with nothing but his fists can stroll up. Otherwise	 the game is fantastic!"

Cut his head off... Nibbled on his bones... beat someone else to death with victims #1's severed head...NOW FOR THE REVIEW:Keep in mind this is early access	 therefore they can fix all of these gripes.To be honest	 they need to fix these issue's as soon as possible or steam reviews will slowly eat away at their credibility.This game has tons of potential	 I will reccomend it for the time being due to it being early access	 they need atleast one week grace period to get servers running as intended. This is day 3 people chill just a bit.Furthermore	 it's $20 you can make that in two hours at a $10/hr highschool job	 if you are younger just do some chores or lawn work. However	 if the devs do not start to fix the issue listed below I will change this to ""Not reccomend"". However they do deserve a ""grace period"".So is it worth your time ? - Yeah	 you will get some good laughs. Such as my full bear armor character running into the airfield	 torch in hand	 with my entire inventory filled with mushrooms. Then beating someone to death with the torch.So is it worth your money ?- This depends on you.For me	 it takes me roughly about 2 hours to make $30. I have now played for 23 hours... nuff said	 1 hour of work for 24 hours of play... Hell I  even hit my goal of $1.00 per hour.So is it fun ?- Good fun with friends...- Fun gunplay...- Also can be a running simulator...- Sometimes feels like a demo in my opinion. But	 simply by changing spawn rates of items and changing the focus of PvP on the map away from military bases will solve most of this issue. (Read more below on my suggestions to get more detail	 and see just how easily this could be fixedNOW WITH BEING SAID	 THIS GAME NEEDS LOTS OF WORK AND SOME OF THESE NEED TO BE ADRESSED ASAP! Pro's:- Looks really good. Great graphics...- Feels very polished	 such as the vault system (great system)- The engine feels responsive (held back by ping)- Lots of quality of life content	 such as the mini games	 bathroom and hunting etc- Best crafting system in any survial game to date. (Needs more things to craft	 however works wel).- When your not rubber banding gunplay feels very nice.- Looks intense on the UI and metabolism	 however you learn it quickly and its very helpful and works well.- Great menu system- LOTS OF POTENTIAL.List of things needed from most important are numbered 1 = 1.5 btw:1) Lack of content(Following the footsteps of ""bless online"" -> even though its early access	 the lack of content is creating a ""♥♥♥♥♥♥storm"" of hate and people demanding refunds).- Needs more guns VERY badly	 there needs to be a tier system	 all the towns are pointless outside of the police stations	 which are ALWAYS ""picked clean"".- This makes all the players ignore all the towns and just kill themselves or make new characters until they spawn close to a military base.- Honestly the front page steam streamer is just running circles at the military bases	 because they are the ONLY locations players even bother to go too.(People tend to only camp in offices in the military bases or hide on roofs.- There needs to be lower and middle tier weapons spawning in the towns often enough to warrent people bothering to stop and loot them.(This also would give players a chance gear up and actually fight in other locations	 furthermore it adress all the bambi's running into military taking all the loot and dying 10 feet infront of the killer robots).- Remove some of the death bots and increase the zombies in military base	 this in conjuction with the previously mentioned increase of weapons and better placement. (The mil base should kit you if you can survive	 and it should be very hard to survive).(You should have to go loot in a smaller town to survive in the military locations).- Military bases should hold modern AK's and M4's and much more	 all weapons should have attachments.- Randomly event dropped military loot in towns to prevoke people to go to them.- More faces	 more tats	 simple make my character not look like everyone else.1.5) Optimize/Balance- SPAWN GUNS WITH CLIPS (Jesus	 who takes the clip and just leaves the gun) (terrible concept)- Let us break down bullets we wont use into metal	 lead and gunpower.- Why is ammo more rare then the guns? Like who thought this was a good idea... It's a TV show about killing not a post appocolyptic world where all the bullet of the world have been shot and not industry is left to make new ones.- Honestly spawn the guns with one full ammo clip (IMO	 but you don't need to do this	 but the guns HAVE to spawn with clips).- Make it more apparent when bleeding.- Add auto run !- Game has memory leaks.- Most players sit at about 30 fps on decent rigs.- Most players use lower end hardware such as 1050's due to the GPU market. (really needs to be able to run at low settings on these rigs).- Even my PC	 specs at bottom should be getting higher FPS. (My game is 100% smooth and good fps	 but honestly it should be better).- The player connection lag	 aka rubberbanding happens alot. (huge problem)- Some servers will never show up for some players. (Two friends can be in one	 yet you will never be able to find it on the browser).- Condence the number of servers and try to increase the connection quality on these	 people will be willing to wait if they know there will not be any rubberbanding.- Better tool tips	 have it say why you can't craft something	 many don't know the survival skill unlocks them.- Smooth out the robots	 they either miss every shot or instantly 360 head shot you.- Every ""fatal error"" that has crashed me and my mates game has resulted in your character dying instantly on joining back	 or slowly vomiting to death.- Placeable items you craft.- Less servers	 they all eventually have peak times and times with no players. There should never be empty servers.- MP 5 sights are not accuarate at times.- You can see floating backpacks and weapons around corners you have not looked past.- Make your stealth and camo work on PVE	 I hate when robots or zombies randomly lock on to me even if im prone in a bush.- Have timers on chainging server	 such as an hour (atleast 30 mins to avoid ghosting)	 however allow it. When my server dies I shouldn't be forced to get off	 start new	 or just PVE til it gets more players.- Make Dex more worth it	 stealth seems to do very little right now. (I have to make my character fat to be most effective).- When my character has to♥♥♥♥♥♥or♥♥♥♥♥♥and does it automatically	 have the character♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants and degrade my gear	 I should loose a fight because my character needed to blow out his stomach.2) World building- Focus on making everthing worth looting	 but being overpowered unless you are able to fight to survive there.- Don't focus the game around the military bases	 move one bases to the larger cities to encourage visiting the towns.- The tactical vests make you look fat and your gun clips through your belly even on fit characters.- Moveable camps or tents that can save gear (Make them raidable).For all those starving	 kill a wild animal and cook it	 you wont need to eat for like 12 hours of real life time.If there are any other sugestions feel free to comment.If you liked the review	 please like it so that the dev can see this.

513710	1	1	76561197984548831	157	27	-1	7.5	August 31	 201	"Thumbs down without a doubt. OMG..where do I start? - It puts you into a character customization screen that's convoluted. I moved sliders and tweeked things for a few minutes until I realized there was some sort of point system. Much of it was grey'd out so you can't adjust them with no explaination why.  They make it look like you can customize your character greatly but it's all a show. It's VERY limited. EDIT: It appears you can't go back later and tweek perks. At all..- Then you get thrown on to a map...Ok....let's wait for some sort of backstory	 idea what you're supposed to do now or basic tutorial...nothing? Umm ok. I guess I'll walk around. In the place of a run key or run toggle	 it's set so you use the mouse wheel to run faster or slower? EDIT: This takes some getting used to..it's annoying.  - There's absolutely no story	 no goals	 no tasks other than to see what's hidden out there and it's all the same stuff. Trainer shoes	 combat boots and hiking boots have no stats attached to them. It makes no difference which ones you wear because you can be in inmate orange or full camo and the zombies still see you. - Let's go into the controls screen to maybe learn what keys do what..Oh..it's a very simplified set up that doesn't include all the keys and actions you can do with the keys. IOW..you can use F to open doors but also use it to search things. You have to HOLD F to get more options. I never would have thought of that..WITHOUT A TUTORIAL. You potentially bypassed valuable items all through the start of the game. EDIT: HOLY Sht..it forces you to take a dmp or p!ss but doesn't tell you in the controls how to do it..(Here's how) Hold down the TAB key..choose different actions from there...Why the effing TAB key? ""F"" is the action key. TAB makes no sense. So..when you character is dancing like he has to tinkle..hold the TAB key..choose toilet and then go to the bathroom anywhere. What? There's a toilet in every house and you can't use it? That would be CRAZY!!! - Back to the invntory: Wait..I can only carry 2 items at a time until I find packs? But crafting sometimes takes more than 2 items? What that means is	 you won't be crafting anything good even if you DO find quality items. - Then I found a fanny pack. Yay! I can carry more items. But now I have the items required to make a rock knife (as it says when you hover the mouse over the rock knife). The Craft button is stiil grey'd out. EDIT: Oh..when I changed shirts	 all the items that were in that short pocket (rocks) got dumped as well. You don't keep them in your inventory. So when you change pants	 jackets	 packs etc	 you have to dump the items out first..pick up the new pack and put the items in. - Crafting when it finally is posible: This part is a RARE benefit..If you have 2 of the items in your inventory and the other items that are needed are right there near you	 it allows you to craft the item even if the parts required are not ON YOU. They're in the vacinity..this is the only positive I've found to crafting. So..go gather some metal	 rubber and other items and just dump them on the ground in one spot. Then choose to craft items using those items. Now..how long will stockpiled items remain? I have no idea. - Houses..they're almost all the same!!! same set up	 same boxes	 same stairs etc etc etc. It makes you wonder if you already checked this house. - Hey I found a small area surrounded by a stone fence. I see some mechs patrolling and zombies. I assume if I lure the zombies near the mech	 the mech will take them out for me. NO...The mech didn't give a squat about the zombies and took me out with 1...ONE gunshot. - Ok..respawn..wait..you just made me NEGATIVE 22 points in your weird point system? - I get respawned way across the map so I find a small group of houses. I run into only 1 zombie. Should be easy enough to kill and I picked up some sort of hunk of metal to hit it with. Wait...there's no targeting system? I'm just randomly swinging my arms about and they're killing me? Why won't it go down? It finally goes down but just gets back up. Wait..somewhere in the fight	 my guy just dropped the hunk of metal? EDIT (If you accidently hold the attack button too long	 it throws whatever is in your hand) Now..Using bare hands	 I knock it down multiple times and barely survive. EDIT: At first it wouldn't give me an option to loot the dead body but now it does. But it just takes everything off the dead zombie and lays it out on the floor so if you killed 2 or 3 in the same spot	 all that loot is bunched up in the same area. (Fix: Hit TAB and all the loot in the close-by area shows up on the left side of the screen. But there's no tutorial showing you this)- I find a magazine clip. Nice! No bullets in it..really? I find a knife! Yaay! I equip it. Luckily I don't see any zombies..I found a rifle just sitting on a box in a house! A EFFING .22? You shoot squirrels with a .22..not zombies. Then I find ammo! Yaay! Oh wait	 it's 9mm ammo. Now	 I have a rifle mag	 9mm ammo and a .22 rifle with no .22 ammo. Where did my knife go? I guess he just dropped it when I picked up the rifle? EDIT: In the inventory page	 it won't allow me to put .22 ammo in the ammo slot for the .22 rifle. You have to equip the gun	 press reload and WOW..the ammo is finally in the ammo slot. I'll play this for a while more and if it doesn't get any better..I'm done with it."

As soon as you reach a good amount of gear you don't really know what to do. For me its great to range the woods	 flat lands and mountains and loot spots	 but I assume this could be a big negative point for a lot of players. I'm already missing quests - I know they will be implemented later.2. The Bunkers should be more difficult to enter. You can trick the mechs with sneaking around corners and fool them. Maybe more Puppets on the bunker property	 so you have to clear it first - And I think there should be Puppets inside the bunkers too.I really love the Game in it's actual state	 but I can't wait to get more stuff implemented.Keep on the good work!"

In my 1 hour playtime i found only useless junk. Fought several zombies with my bare hands and a sledgehammer which i found. Fighting feels awful and clunky. The zombies outrunning you with ease	 no chance to run away you have to fight them. They can jump like 15 feet high	 must be some kind of uber zombies xDDon't get fooled by the fake videos with cool pvp battles.

This game has a ton of potential	 but the servers need fixed ASAP. The Dsync will be the downfall of this game. I really hope to see more content	 and Dsync fixed very soon. But yes	 this game can be very fun. I do reccomend it for an easy $20.00"
513710	1	0	BigIrishPanda	77	5	1	32.3	September 10	 201	"Overall I love the game. It's everything I wish DayZ was and more. It continues to surprise me how tranquil yet challenging the game can be at such an early stage of development. I personally enjoy playing single player or with a couple friends on a private server so I don't have the experience of playing with a ton of people	 but even with the few of us we have  a blast. Trying to sneak past mechs into a military base for that good loot is exilirating. I hope that the developers continue what they have been doing and take this game to new heights. Hopefully soon they will include a bicycle or perhaps tameable horse to ride to get around the map easier. Other than that it's a very enjoyable and highly realistic survival/apocalypse simulator."

However the lag is insane	 the mechanics for aiming the guns etc is terrible even when you start off with higher exp. The energy is completely off the scale	 cant seem to keep it up at all. Too much to worry about instead of actually enjoying the game. Perhaps they could include building forts / camps?? gets tiring running around after you find all the military loot. Not much to do after that."

There is heavy censorship of the topic on the game foums as well	 extremely disappointing"

Right now there is no end game which just resolves in getting absolutely geard and PVPing other players BUT....... WE HAVE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN look at how DayZ Standalone has turned out to be and it scares me to see another game like this that has MASSIVE POTENTIAL. Like come on this is 2018 we shouldnt be getting something like this which is a repeat. I just hope the developers have learned from DayZ Standalone's Mistake
513710	1	0	B3AT5	42	4	1	32.3	September 1	 201	Tbh this game is really great and I enjoy playing it. It has a few ups and downs such as bugs but it is still an Alpha game. I believe this game has a lot of potential (more than Dayz ever had). A few things I'd like to see fixed are: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-Servers in the Server List should show the IP so it's easier to connect & play with friends-Fix the BCU (It's a little to much)-Make the crafting UI a little more flush and easier to use-Buff the Hunger (I would eat a whole meal and be stuffed on the BCU then about 5 minutes go by and i'm starving)-Buff the Stamina/Energy slightly -Make it harder to get Military gear-Nerf the Sentries/Mechs slightly (They can currently 2 tap  you unless you bob and weave you may escape)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I may add on to the list but as I stated it's still an Alpha game and I'm looking forward to the Devs adding More things & Patching Bugs.

This launch is so far better than DayZ servers and a lot of other games but what I would hate is for this game's rep to be ruined by people reviewing the SERVERS and not the GAME. Overall I would say this game has taken a lot of the best elements of survival games	 used a dayz template	 and then added a few mechanics that this genre hasn't seen yet (extensive diet	 vaulting).  The crafting is awesome and you can really learn how to do it quickly. If you can't handle the semi-goofy servers	 wait for it. But I really enjoy it having come from games like Rust	 H1Z1	 DayZ	 etc."

Just try out Singleplayer first	 and try to learn the game. It's really easy to start knowing how things work	 and if you don't know	 just try googleing it up or something.I do know that the best way in the beginning to get loot	 is to find bunkers	 but there are these robots walking around there	 and if they see you	 they will shoot the heck out of you. But they have a pattern that they walk on	 so as soon as they turn their back on you	 go and open the big bunker doors. You will get tons of good stuff from them.This game is in early access right now	 and I'm so excited to see the future of this game	 right now	 there is not much to do	 mostly like running around exploring and looting/killing zombies (puppets)But i've seen that they are probably going to add base building and veichles which you can drive	 in the future of course. But for now	 I really do enjoy this game. Not hard to pick up.7/10 for right now (may change in the future. Because there is a lot of bugs happening	 for example the screen freezes sometimes	 for like 1 second.)"

I had a good geared guy	 ate well	 no problem. Until my health started depleting until my eventual demise. I would love to see a depth explaination about treatments and reasons for why problems such as my health depleting occured	 (sodium level was 28% btw	 so that was not the cause). I would also like to see a depth explaination aboot every aspect of the metabolism tab	 and what will occur if say I had a lack of a certain vitamin	 what will happen if I don't treat it and how can I get that certain vitamin back up.Another con is the limited path the mechs follow. One mech followed a triangle path outside the bunker entrance	 I had no time to be able to run into the bunker without hearing ""Target Engaged"" and getting ripped apart.Overall	 Scum is amazing.

You also shouldn´t mind those negative reviews of people mad about the game being too dificult or them just crying around because they died within the first hour on the game... Mind saying that the game isn't suppose to be easy	 you will die multiple times full of gear	 but that is what makes the game fun and not repetitive when you with full on gear!So I hope the game continues growing strong and continues to improving =) PS : All the best for all the guys working on this for the past years!

In a survival game	 a RANK? for killing others? Ayer you f...kiddin me?I had thoug that would be different in this game because get things wont be so hard to obtain Because of the biometrics and hundres of variables ... the enviroment... that zombies would be dangerous.Would be hard to survive only hunting people. I was wrong...the same problem here. No reason to buy this. People keeps playing all the survivals game like PUBG... So I prefer keep playing PUBG.The game is early access...If the game changes and the enviroment is important	 and pleople start roleplaying.

Besides of some problems on MY hardware (running the Game on an I5-4690k	 16GB DDR3 and a R9 390 8GB Version)And even though i'am in between of 40-60 FPS i just love the game. Heard about it like 2 Days ago and i could not believe it.. You can climb	 hunt Animals	 there is PvP	 a giant open World and way more important	 the feeling most of us had when playin DayZ.Ive encountered 1 Player on a full server by now - Pro : A nice guy	 played a lil with him until we died to Macs. Con: Even though there is much PPl on a Server	 you wont encounter them until you get into High loot areas.Its an early access game and all of us kinda know what it means and we all r tired of it. This Games takes EA to a diff. Level. There is content. Maybe as much as in DayZ but with way more Features besides of looting and killing People. For a Price of 17€ (will increase during EA as content will be added) this game is much more then worth it!"

Loot is a bit scarce but I've already killed someone with pistol	 had a m1garand	 plenty of 22's and 1 MP5 but I didn't have a clip so I had to single shot with it.

You’re going to be greeted with a simple	 short menu ( no tutorial or how-to-play guide yet) and you’re going to click “multi-play”. You’ll refresh and there are a whole load of servers to choose from	 (too ♥♥♥♥ing many if you ask me) and really on the first go you’re gonna click the most legitimate looking one you can see. Organisation of the server list could be better and a little bit clearer. Then you’ll spawn into the map not knowing what the f*cking Jeffries you’re doing. You’re gonna run around press ‘F’ on some random crap on the floor and pick rocks up. Then- you’re going to decide this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and boring and log off.DO NOT LOG OFF. GIVE IT A CHANCE. Don’t take the game too seriously. Loot some buildings	 kill some zombies and♥♥♥♥♥♥in some bushes. There is so much to do on the game at the moment. You can find cars	 take people hostages	 cook human meat/animal meat as a source of energy - not to mention the intricate looking menu with you heart rate temperature etc. I reckon this game knows what it’s doing but just hasn’t painted the walls yet.

(you poop out items randomly with the delux pack dlc)- We were running into a mech zone and i had hyperthermia stage 3 and we were running around and i started to vommit in the open and a mech seen me and shot me to 1 hp and i died right infront of my friend.- I finished looting an area and i was walking to my friend to meet with him and i heard a gunshot so i went over to kill them and i seen a bullet fly past my head and i hid behind the rock to see where he was and i seen 2 Bambis with stone weapons and they said that they were friendly and their friend with the gun came over and i was deciding on if i wanted to kill them and then i had explosive diarrhoea and i said ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; then they killed me and took my loot"

513710	3	0	1eNsu1	35	3	-1	15.0	August 30	 201	"If this game had basebuilding it would be worth my time. However at its current state they released it this is how my gameplay went:Hours 1: feeling out the game to then die to 2 guys with guns.Hours 2-5: looting more guns and playing around with a friend. (Also this is a running simulator) To die and lose my gear because I cant stash anything I end up looting.Hours 6-9: Looting more guns and playing with the same friend. (Also	 this is still a running simulator) to get 1 tapped by a dragunov while running to a town.Without base building/fortifying ability there is no where to put all the loot you get after hours of grinding there is nothing to do and no way to save anything you grind out. To get 1 tapped in the head while running 2 times in almost 10 hours of gameplay in which 90% of it is running and looting Is not a fun experience at all. Combined with the poor optimization and server crashes this game would be worth in my eyes about 5-10$ at its current state.All that being said this game has a LOT of potential and I hope I dont see this ending up like DayZ standalone. I am also aware that this 10 hour gameplay is the first 24 hours after the release of the game.. However it does not justify the bad experience I had with giving it a good review. This is to help anybody who is looking at this to hopefully get a better understanding of the average buyers experience.All in all I'd recommend steering clear from this game until further updates/patches. Keep doing what you're doing devs."
513710	5	0	xhodar	65	1	1	65.1	August 30	 201	"The game has alot of potential. Its gives me the old Dayz mod feeling. But things that I would like to see.- Optimize the game. Yes its early access but this should always be the main goal. Make a game playable. I am using a 8700K with a 1080 and I have drops under 30 FPS... - Optimize the servers	 stable servers and a notification that a server will shutdown/restart would be nice. Looted places should contain faster loot for new people that join. I was looting empty places for hours.- Make a endgame. Build a base to store stuff. That you can break in to. Events to kill Mechs with loot. Maybe that loot you can make vehicles or something. Just something more then hey I am max geared gonna shoot some randoms now. Getting boring really fast.- Connect servers. Make server clusters that if I join my friend on another server I don't lose my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Starting over everytime is not cool. atleast your gear and points should go over. and make a 5 min relog delay for ghosting/loot respawning. do something creative.- skills/disciplines. I saw the skilltree and stuff but it was kinda disapointing. I saw alot of stuff but basicly it was nothing at all.- Crafting. wanted to make a storage box but needed planks or something but how do I get those? maybe a better tooltip for this or did I just miss something?Few small things I thought was weird.- Could not see if what firemode my weapon was on. Middle mouse just did CLICK but did not see anything change.- Armor not showing. I had so much stuff that the armor didn't show up anymore. Only when I dropped a few things like my shirt and jacket.- Storage system. I think all those small storages is anoying. with all those small pockets here and there. Just make a general and backpack. Atleast I like that more.- Mechs. I like that the good loot is protected that its not super easy to loot. But the mechs are kinda spotting you to easy. This makes fights on high loot areas not worth it. Cause the change you get shot by a mech is pretty big. This could use some tuning. Also it gives away your position pretty badly	 Since they even point to the direction some one is.- dropping your gun. When you have 2 slots full and your hands are full you drop that thing you have. Now this is mostly your gun. But it would be nice if your done using your hands that you automaticly just pick up your gun again. I lost a few guns/toolboxes this way and saw this happen on streams to.Would I recommend the game in the current state. No. eventough this is one of the best early access releases I have played. I even think its better then Dayz standalone in its current state after 3 years.But I said yes because I am supprised about how good it is allready and if they fix the FPS/Servers alone it will be fun enough."

Hell yeah.Does it require fast PC ? Yeah (I am on i7 5820k 6c @ 4GHz + 24GB DDR4 + GTX 1080 and runs on high/max at 1080p	 I would say a bit overkill for a graphic that you get)Is it boring now ? Unfortunately	 there is no much that you can do	 you can try and find items in buildings (game has worst item spawing in a history	 to find something usefull you have to look for 30-40 minutes	 to get a gun probably 2-3h).Is it worth $20 ? I would say so	 great has a great potential	 and I think that with a 12-18 months of dev time	 the game could be worth $30-$50.However you have to be aware that you are an Alpha tester	 game is no ready	 not so enjoyable at this moment	 there is not much to do (severs like to suddenly cease to exist (official))	 but the game has potential.It could be the best survivial game out there.

The devs need to fix a pretty horrible memory leak which cuts your FPS in half after an hour (ish). If you log out and in again	 your full FPS comes back. Further optimization is also needed	 in general.The game has hunger and thirst and all kinds of stats but absolutely no need for any sleep ....which is just very strange indeed.  This really needs to be added.But is it worth it.....?    Yes	 despite these things	 it is definitely worth getting.  Joining the journey this game is going to go on is worth £15. Absolutely. No doubt of that. Buy it. You will agree."

PVP comes in at a very distant second.If you sprint everywhere and fight everything	 you'll quickly find out that you're not an olympic athlete and probably run out of energy and that guy who only has his fists... is going to murder you with them. Then he'll eat you because he knows proteins and fats are more important than killing randoms.If you're buying this game for PVP. Buy something else.Also; there is a very steep learning curve. You wont know how to do everything on day one. Even if your day one is a full 24 hours of play. That's my favorite part of this game so far. So much information. And everything is equally important. Anyone who tells you it's easy to play	 is the person you'll see on the SCUM reddit or Discord asking why they're always passing out	 or why can't they stop defacating everywhere."

First off	 as I said the games values and concept are great. I love the open world feeling of hunger games. Looting and character developement are AWESOME. This game produces them like none other.

The view distance and bloom are annoying. Good luck getting a thousand metre shot in this game. (Scope zeroing actually gets that high in Scum) Tree lines become blurs at certain distances	 why.There is 7 rifles ingame atm. M1	 KAR98	 SVD	 AKS74U	 AK 47	  AKM	 Hunter 55.1 handgun M9. 1 Shotgun ""TEC01 490"" (made up gun) and 1 submachine gun the MP5.The models are nice to look at which is a good thing I guess. Personally I would like more variety in guns and less focus on food items or clothes. The SVD feels nice until you shoot it	 Sounds like a potato (quiet) and is less powerful than one in this game (takes a few centre mass shots to drop a zombie). A theme for all guns in this game is that you think to yourself  ""Oh	 ok maybe they are working on this gun	 and will improve it later."" Then you fire the next gun.. and think maybe not. Firing weapons in this game makes me appreciate other games more.The gunplay is a massive step down from Dayz and Arma obviously	 has to be said	 it is more arcadey than realistic. Inaccurate bullet spread in third and first person and bullet dmg is a joke. Zeroing does not work properly either. Side note; shooting a zombie with a shotgun several times point blank is just immersion breaking and clunky.No base building. If they had base building similar to Ark; Survival Evolved	 Rust etc. I would recommend this game	 I would find that fun and interesting. Without base building it's a survival game where you horde things in your inventory just to die later	 nothing gained. PVP just for the sake of PVP in a survival game is just sad imo. There are better games for that. Melee weapon crafting is ok	crafting in Scum in general is fluid. Which i guess you can't say about a lot of other survival/crafting games. Not amazing though	 item placement needs improvement	 not that it matters	 there doesn't seem to be much difference in terms of dmg between a crafted axe (easy to make) and a crafted metal sword	 which i find very weird and a dissapointing discovery when you find all the parts for a item you think is going to kick♥♥♥♥♥because it's difficult to make.Food crafting is a mess in terms of effort. Building a fire is very buggy atm. I had to look up on YouTube how to start one because I didn't want to waste time figuring out the specific niche way to work around a bug.Ingredients are too varied and don't spawn enough to be a viable or a reliable way to eat. Tedious recipes don't reward your effort at all leaving you feelling like you could have eaten those zombie parts you cut up a while back instead of grinding for a pot of chilli con carne thinking it would give you better sustainability. I like the idea of cooking different things	 it's a good idea	 but implemented incorrectly	 eg; grindy with no tangible payoff	 it can be a bad idea.Hyperthermia is buggy	 If I am hyperthermic swimming underwater in the rain there is something very wrong. But hey ♥♥♥♥ you	 you didn't figure out the specific way we want you to negate this condition so you're gonna die idiot. lol.Also you poo through your jeans in this game. You don't pull down you pants when you take a dump. You poo right through them	 do you have the most powerful bowels in the world?  Come on	 you kill players and die in horible ways but you won't show a bum in an animation while squeezing one off or a peen and balls when you take a whizz. Hey everyone loves the hillarity of it but you got to commit. lazy.Wait a few years for the game to develop into a game worth buying because as of now its got nothing to keep me playing. xoxo gossip girl."

Terrible timing that because ive been anticipating its release for a while. But back to the game. Its crafting is well thoughtout and consistantly useful. The food and body composition system is ynique nd really cool. I like the breakdown of whats in your stomach and the realtime needing to pee and poop ingame. It plays comparably to dayz but is less buggy and feels more complete in its current build in my opinion. the map features a lot of unique and distinct locations like weird tunnels and a vineyard i found one time. I look forward to playing again in 5-6 weeks and reccommend you buy it in the meantime.

Some bugs which I will list (from memory) and some things I would love to see in the game that I rhink would make it blow all other games out of the water...Bugs first I guess:Trouble starting fires. Both firering and fireplace indoors and out (recent patch too)Auto dropping is kind of annoying. I understand it's how the inventory management works which is done really well	 but auto drop causes a lot of accidents and equipment left behind/lostIt would be nice if (at least on single player) objects didn't reset on load... or ""player.interacted"" objects didn't.... I like to decorate.I will make a full written list eventually	 and post that but this is all I got for bugs (as well as ideas)Now for ideas:Free-run parcore	 Dying light did it well	 and I think with some adjustments and progress into the future it will be entirely possible and a major game changer (3rd person will be hard	 and would love to BETA test that <3 ).A fishing element (which i think I saw in the skill/stats)	 but execution IN MY OPINION should similar to that of Russian Fisher 4 = a great balance between simplicity	 thoroughness	 and fluidity (the castingand reeling as well as how fish&bait&tackle relate to your inventory) With your free look and a makeshift fishing pole it would be a major step up in the survival game genre.I'm sure basebuilding (however in-depth/expansive it may be) will be included	 and with how smart the team may be i'm sure some basic of framing can be used. Everything else in brilliantly in-depth	 so pull out an old Architectural Graphic Standards book and have us learn some sh*tThat's I have for now	 like I said I'll make a better list soon	 I just wanted to get these out there. Great game! 10/10 the potential is great. I invested in No Man's Sky from day one and it turned out great given some time	 and I think the same will go for SCUM... only better.

Game already has: Map with location	 jumping/vaulting	 a UI that tells you what is  going on with your character (In extreme detail)	 a sprint meter (that makes sense)	 recipes for crafting are findable in game ( no need to search google )	 and more.I can't speak for if this game will continue to prosper and live up to the hype as it is barely a week into release but so far everything works pretty smoothly and I don't feel like I am playing a broken game like I did when I played Dayz.

Then there's the combat which is boring and also annoying. you see 	 you have the ""puppet's"" which which can detect you from pretty absurd ranges aswell as sneak up on you and they can apparently jump walls you can barely vclimb over	 rotting decaying zombies can jump higher than you can and run faster	 oh yeah they can run and they can run fast	 it's impossible to outrun them	 in fact you'll just end up attracting more.melee combat boils down to lock on with V	 bait an attack then smack with melee but the problem is the zombies attack faster than you can aswell	 they can probably attack you twice in the time it take for you to start swinging your weapon and baiting a zombie is hard because they run faster than you can so they get right in your face and attack	 you barelly avoiding it	 also the block is garbage	 some weapons I can hold the guard but some it only lasts a second and it doesnt matter anayway because you get hurt regardless and in terms of stealth	 yeah it's bad there aswell. You move at a snails pace it doesnt matter because STEALTH IS BAD	 i mentioned absurd enemy detections and i wasn't lying	 enemy's can see your no matter how camo'd up you are	 no matter how hidden you are or howgeared you are	 you will get seen and it just annoying	 the only time stealth is a viable option is against other players because fighting isn't worth it as gunplay feels... odd to say the least and bullets are so rare aswell as actual weapons. For a game that emphasises realism it's got so many kinks to work out with it's core design and i like the premise and i can say that it's better than dayz in looks but the world still feels empty	 there's no vehicles ( that work ) either which makes me sad.TL:DR: Not fleshed out enough iMO needs more time before I recommend purchasing	 alot more time.P.S i actually like the crafting system aswell as having to maintain your heartrate and calorie intake."

513710	0	0	tyberin	291	6	1	75.2	September 3	 201	"That game puts whole survival genre on completly new level. Every game that was before tagged as ""Survival game"" now seems a bit... shallow. The whole metabolism system is huge step forward and even if the game currently has many missing features ( it just started Early Access - most people probably assumed there's gonna be everything already or almost everything	 for me it's very decent Early Access start ) the whole foundation of the game is rock solid and works. IMHO devs did splendid work and I give them huge benefit of the doubt for future developement because it's hell of a fun already. If you're interested in running	 shooting everyone around and have zilion different features than it's too early for that ( Early Access ). But if you feel like you might enjoy: - hunting ( you can track animals by blood if animals is wounded )- wandering around ( whole stamina / energy system that prevents you from sprinting all the time but just to walk or run slowly to keep stamina high for emergency situations - simple but really give you a realistic aspect of how it would look if you'd be in similiar situation - instead of being Usain Bolt all day long )  - handling zombies ( melee fight system is badass	 the feel of weight of objects as you swing but also as the hit lands - I just love it - hit the zombie with metal baseball bat in face to know what I'm talking about - but even simple boxing feels good - the sounds of breaking jaw or a nose when you hit straight into zombie face - that's just how it should be done )- sneaking around robots at military areas for military gear - now	 that's odd. for me it was completly anti-climatic at the beginning	 but after some time I actually appreciate the sneaking-around-something-greater-than-me-that-might-crush-me-easily feeling ( TBH I would add something like robots shooting flares into place you got spotted at night or something like that to have the sneaking aspect even more important for people instead of letting know not only robots but also everyone around that there is someone sneaking around )- and most of all - metabolism aspect - at first complicated and felt like a cannon ball you got chained to	 but after knowing it better it seems very balanced and very smart implemented. it's not about focusing heavily on eating whole time. it's focused on having a decent meal from time to time to cover your body needs and then that ""buffer"" lets you eat less or eat uncooked food for a decent period of time until your ""virtual"" body start to alert you that you need another mixed and decent meal. also I have to point out the one thing about crafting system - if you need to cut something	 you need something sharp	 that's all	 no matter if you got knife	 axe	 sword or whatever else is sharp in the game	 it will work. Same goes for other stuff	 so you might craft specific thing by dozen of different recipes	 if you don't have a rope	 you can make improvised rope from rags or use a wire if you found one. Be aware that current crafting system isn't deep by how many things you can craft	 but - just as whole game - it got very solid foundation for future expanding and implementing new crafting recipes at updates. I just have one hope	 there are many	 many promising Early Access games that turned into never-ending-early-access-games or went in a wrong diraction in developement and from something promising ended up as never-reached-own-potential product. So I just hope that SCUM will have a good developement rate and noticable content updates that encourage you to dig deeper instead of just read change-log and not even trying it out.For now - game is great and worth the price. Time will tell if it gonna be the game that completly change the survival games genre or just a game worth mention after couple year - there was this game with interesting metabolism system but nothing more."

Scum in its Early Access alpha state at launch is actually a better overall game than DayZ even though DayZ had over 5 years of development time. Anyone who enjoys the survival sandbox genre will really enjoy this game. This game does has a learning curve. If you have the patience to learn about this game	 it's pretty rewarding. Gamespires (the devs) did a good job with the combat system	 survival system	 graphics	 sound effects	 crafting system	 and added so many little details into this game that you'll appreciate after playing for a while. Of course	 being an Early Access game	 Scum does have many issues that need to be fixed and changed before I can call this game great. The netcode / desync is probably the biggest issue on most servers	 even official servers. PvP can be very hit or miss	 depending on the server you're on. If you're on a well-performing server	 PvP is great fun. If the server is not up to par	 it's a teleport / desync fest and nearly unplayable. Server instability is also an issue. Other changes and fixes I believe that are needed are as follows:- Lower the night time duration from 3 hours down to 30 minutes. 3 hours darkness is not fun in any game.- Fall damage is tuned a bit high right now. A 2m fall can result in at least 25hp loss and it takes forever to regen health in this game	 since there are no instant heals. - Zombies in this game are great	 but a bit overtuned. Some zombies can take up to 3 direct shotgun blasts to kill. They can also glitch through walls and doors. Not as bad as in DayZ	 but it's a problem.- The Fame Points system is a good idea	 but Fame should only be gained from killing players	 not doing monotonous PvE tasks like chopping down trees and running around for hours	 or shooting mechs from far away. It's silly that FP can be farmed so easily in this game. Losing so many FP when you die also needs to be adjusted. - Mechs should be able to be killed easier. It took me over 500 7.62x39 rounds to take down a mech	 and it dropped nothing. No Fame Points	 no loot. I know their objective is to be a sentry and guard high quality loot in this game	 but not being able to take a mech down with more ease is a missed opportunity in this game. - While I enjoy the RPG aspects to this game that allows you to customize your character's stats and skills	 being able to not render on someone else's screen while proned or crouched if you have more Camouflage than someone else's Awareness skill is not good game design. Plus	 it looks dumb seeing floating weapons on an invisible character model.If Gamespires can get the netcode / desync issue resolved quickly and implement their roadmap for this game in a timely fashion	 Scum will become an amazing game. It already has the foundation of a great game and has so much potential to be truly special. For $20	 it's a bargain if you enjoy this genre. Highly recommend people try it out."

I have been playing with a bunch of friends and I have never laughed so hard in my life purely due to certain mechanics in this game. Although the game currently is short of content I am genuinely excited by the roadmap put in place by Gamepires and I am fully looking forward to see how this game evolves through the early access period.

This game has exceeded my expectations in nearly all catagories. Even the horrid desync at launch was fixed within a week to be bareable. Combat isn't perfect but it's still fun. The survival aspect is IMO one of the best systems to date and will only improve. I don't like comparing it to DayZ because DayZ took  years  to add simple♥♥♥♥♥♥this game already covers and more. For $20 it's a no brainer from me to buy especially if the devs continue building onto an already aesthetically pleasing game. Easy 9/10 for an early access  survival game!

Although my PC cannot run the highest settings smoothly	 I would suggest an optimization overhaul. I'm not saying it's horrible	 but when entering a town there is a significant drop in frame rate and sometimes freezing	 and thats on a medium setting. Another thing I would highly recommend is the increase of loot spawning. Seriously	 I spent 2 hours just trying to find enough food to survive	 and I mean BARELY survive. Not only food frequency	 but also ammo spawn next to or near weapons. I am very excited to see what the future holds for this game	 and I will continue to play it as long as I see routine progress in the development of the core gameplay. Please don't sell out and start releasing a bunch of B.S. DLCs before the game is solid across the board. I've seen too many games fail by taking that path. Keep working	 it's great so far!"

Avoiding them became more of an annoyance than a challenge.- People are teleporting midfight. On a server with 30 players. Really?- Zombies are dumb.

Crafting	 vaulting	 intractable objects everything works.The UI is confusing at start but it all have sense later	 ex. if u put candle on a table than take a zippo	 select them both u can light it.  From the experience of other games we expect that we can light the candle when both the items r inside the backpack and that is not realistic at all.I see people complaining about blinking enemies but that is because people try to 3rd person peak	 when in combat use first person	 so far i don't have any blinking issue. (That is how the game solves 3rd person peaking	 players should disappear if some object is in LOS.)This game is in early alpha and im amazed why people r complaining about some problems that the game have and expect to be like some AAA $60 game from the start.I just really hope the devs continue the good work and don't become greedy with some money milking♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game will be the game i was waiting for so long."

I've been disappointed over and over again by these survival games and have been waiting for the next DayZ Mod. I sank easily 1000+ hours into that over the span of a few years and miss all the friendships and good times we had on private servers. The crafting system is seriously unintuitive and I feel like I've spent more time searching how to play the game than actually playing it	 but I haven't complained yet. The lack of dedicated server files is seriously disappointing as your only option is to rent one at a hefty price. Give me dedi server files and I will be happy. I haven't played on public servers yet	 so I can't comment on the desync issues people are mentioning	 but the 2 hours I played with 2 people were smooth and we had no problems. Combat can feel a bit clunky at times	 but it's really not bad. Optimization isn't terrible either	 even on a dated system (8350	 970 SSC @ 1.5GHz	 16GB DDR3) I manage to pull 60 fps pretty consistently with mintor *ini tweaks. Overall	 with all the minor issues and not a whole lot of content available yet	 I would recommend it in its current state. I've only sank 2 hours in and I can see quite a few more in its current state	 which is already my money's worth. $20 for 2 hours of entertainment is more than I usually get. This one is promising and I don't believe it's another DayZ clone cash grab. Please don't break my heart devs. <3"

I still enjoy the game and will play through early access. I'm looking forward to see how this plays out. I do still prefer DayZ tho and would play that before this every day if it wasn't for the lack of players. Still worth a thumb up for the low price and I've only played three hours so far. I will change my review after more hours if my opinion changes.

I usually don't enjoy survival games because you have to craft and gather way too much	 SCUM does not give that feel. I actually enjoy going through the towns looking for items because it feels like I am actually trying to survive. From the in-depth BCU stats to the vitamin/food type information it really feels like you are trying to stay alive.The zombies are top notch. They can pose a threat if they catch you unaware but most of the time it is easy to take them out or navigate around them.The graphics are out of this world. HOWEVER....... I can usually only run it for about 30 min before it crashes my GPU. I have a GTX 1060 6GB so I am not sure why I am having this issue. I have turned all the graphics down so if anyone has any other ideas I would love to hear them.I cannot wait for more and more patches and content to come out.

The Devs have a lot of work ahead of them if this is to become a really good game and not a boring repetition for gamers. SCUM gets many things right from the start	 but even though this is a survival game it still needs to become a game that people will enjoy and to keep playing it!Now lets see what SCUM gets right from the start.-----------PROS---------- :)#SINGLE PLAYER MODE: A survival game created mainly for a multiplayer audience that respects the fact that a lot of people want and prefer the single gamer experience.   #GREAT GRAPHICS & ENVIROMENT:Beautiful scenery	 night and day cycle that feels real. huge world to play.#SMART SURVIVAL MECHANICS:The entire metaboilsm mechanic is an excellent idea and provides depth to the game	 having to ballance your diet in a scarecity situation is trully an epic task.#UNIQUE CRAFTING SYSTEM: It feels real	 it is actually really hard and time consuming to create something. It's not complex but it's realism makes it really hard.#INTELLIGENT INVENTORY SYSTEM: It Is very different than other inventory systems cause it adds logic behind the management of your space	 what to put where actually matters to your survival. (you begin the game with two pockets) #UNDER CONSTANT THREAT: The sensation that you are not safe and always have to look over your shoulder	 even when you're safe	 gives a deep survival feeling to the game. #NICE THROWING MECHANIC: One of the most enjoyable moments in the game is when you actually hit a Zombie straight through the head	 from far away using just your wooden spear...most of the times you don't.#YOUR ANY MISTAKE COULD BE FATAL: Everything you do needs to be orchestrated to perfection	 no mistakes are allowed	 your stealth	 when you fire your gun etc....  you really need to be prepared or you will die	 this I promise.What the game fails to get right...--------CONS------- :(#BAD GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION: The Devs need to address this quickly or they will loose players and income. SCUM developers released the game thinking that all the gamers in the world own high end machines that can run the game on EPIC graphics settings with no sweat... they were very	 very wrong. Most PCs will have to strugle even on LOW settings.#BAD COMBAT MECHANICS: This falls under the category - DEVS this is supposed to be a game not a real life simulation!!! When you begin the game you have nothing	 you're a fool	 you can't shoot anything straight	 you can't really fight	 you can't stealth	 you are a complete moron and for this you will die many	 many times! Please devs	 make fighting more enjoyable	 the game is already hard! Make our punches count	 our axes do actual damage and our rifles work!!!#NO LEARNING CURVE/ NO TUTORIAL: I find this very stange because this game feels more like a simulation and it's not for the casual player. A learning curve is always requiered in a survival/crafting game. A simple 10 minute tutorial and to begin in a relativelly safe zone should be implemented on SCUM.#NO BOW!!! is this a survival game??? where the bow and arrows???#NO REAL PURPOSE/ NO END GAME:Its feels like a nice walk through the woods and scenery. I guess (hope) that an end game or a goal will be implementent eventually	 something like actually escaping would be great!FINAL EARLY ACCESS VERDICT: After the latest patches I have to say that the game has become playable	 some bugs remain	 optimization is still an issue	 battle system is problematic	 but for me this will all be fixed in the future. For the devs: A Survival game experience doesn't need to be more complex	 or more realistic than it needs to be. Remember that first and foremost this is a game! We need to keep having fun to keep playing it!"

So much lag I cant play at all and PvP is just so buggy. Even single player is a no go as soon as you fight Puppets its so slow. The crafting is over complicated in most areas. Even opening a can is silly.The metabolism tab is just not needed. Its hard enough staying alive building and crafting. You need to be able to play the game. Id say eating is too much at the moment. I eat 2 candy bars 2 tin of spagetti and a banana and I was still hungry. Thats just stupid. It looks great. Just needs to be less complicated in most areas. I cannot recommend this game as it stands its good to help out on early access but its not really playable for me. Plus not being able to build a shelter till your a higher rank is supid we are talking about a crappy wooden shack.

My first playthrough I booted it up in single player to get the experience and feel for how the gameplay works. Its an unpopular opinion	 but I do enjoy how menacing the Mechs are in the game	 and how they are something to be avoided rather than being able to take them down with a bolt action rifle. That being said	 I do hope they employ some kind of EMP devices in the future or some kind of counter to the mechs. As far as difficulty the most your going to have to worry about is very early game inventory management. There isnt much in the way right now as of base buildind	 but you can chop a few trees down and make inventory boxes near towns and houses for loot farming. I enjoy the fact that loot in this game makes sense	 for example	 military bases have the highest yield for medical and firearms	 houses for clothes and food with very rare chances for weapons. A lot of effort went into the game to get it where it is and from the developers YouTube channels they seem pretty adament about keeping this game alive and running. I am satisfied with my purchase."

It's a huge chart that has every single details of your body. You should maintain that to survive. Other thing ""puppets"" so called zombies are so damn tough	 I suggest to make at least a big stone axe at very start of the game so you can at least kill them with around 5 to 6 shots but just don’t stay in one place and hit them like other games	 you gota hit and run or sprint backwards while attacking. Good lots are very scarce and when you get them when you need it badly specially a huge backpack lol you'll be celebrating a joyful moment. so everything matters. Each and every items will be very useful and when you enter the military base or anything similar the risk of getting killed is very high unless you maintain stealth and make a plan how to avoid zombies and the killer machines. You have to survive and it’s a struggle in this game but achieving something is very rewarding and kinda awesome moment. Other enemy are the rest of the players unless you have a mutual understating and being friend with them or just they'll kill you for your items. So we have tons of things to worry about and stay alive. Mostly this game is very addicting. I love it! According the roadmap of this game it's gona be something really cool. Anyway let's see in future how it goes. Oh dang	 that bear -_-"

You'll reach this phase at some point where you got nothing to do and game becomes unplayable	 I do understand this game is not just alpha but pre-alpha? but still	 doesn't justify a whole team behind this game where they can release it as paid pre alpha but not enough content.

We played on a server in our region	 with a ping of <20	 and it still had real bad issues. For some reason the obtuse inventory management is back from DayZ	 including putting items into your ""hands slot"" and gun management. I wouldn't mind a complicated system	 if it at least worked half the time. Foliage and DoF kills frames and you have to rely on .ini editing to properly change graphics settings and some keybinds. Why when I search an item / dead person	 the items go on the ground next to them? Have it in a separate menu so you can see everything. I love trying to find the small items the players had behind a blade of grass. I returned the game before the 2 hour mark because I didn't want to be stuck with this unoptimized game until it's fixed. It's somehow worse than DayZ at launch. I might pick it up in the future	 because I would love a proper DayZ game	 but this isn't it in it's current state. I do not recommend the game in it's current state	 but I do have at least some hope for the game after a few months and some solid patches.

I'm enjoying everything so far from day 1 Early Access!!!The price is totally worth 20$ and once finished with adding tons of content -more crafting	 weapons	 mech	 AI	  vehicles	 aircrafts	 new maps etc etc etc	 the final price could go up to $40-$60 so for the price now it's a good deal and game is totally playable. PvP needs balancing worked on just as all EA games that's the point right to sort out balance	 problems	 bugs even find and rid any exploits	 duping etc and *DEVELOP a game properly to be ready and polished for final release out of early access with the communites support	 ideas and help to report any bugs thus = ""EARLY ACCESS"".( My overall review will be constantly updated/changed while putting *hours in actual experience/testing all gameplay it has to offer )PROS-Advanced skill / level up system Large map to explore and survive in with many threats from zombies	 bears	 boars	 weather 	 sickness	nutrition loss	 AI restricted high loot area's	 other players etcNew health monitor survival system is taking survival to the next level like no other gameAwesomeness like mixing Terminator	 Resident Evil	 PUBG	 Miscreated 	7d2d	 DayZ etc. SCUM is original like that but a lot of adavnced survival aspects makes it even more complex and adds realism and the melee combat so far seems smooth and not just able to spam attack.Many weapons to lootMultiplayer slaughtering zombies co-op PvE or take on other players in PvP as wellThe fist and melee combat almost feels like Kindom Come Deliverance combat but better.Epic Crafting SystemSolid base gameplay and storyNext-Gen Survival feeling very realisticSkill system according to gameplayLoot scattered around fairly easy to get melee armed in the startZombies hoards!!Smart dangerous AI enemy drones	mechas etcCONS/BUGS-Invertory slot sometimes disappears and a restart can fix itNo Xbox One / Ps4 controller support as of yet I was able to bind all controls and works fineSlight to some major stutter fps drop by buildingsThe sky turned into grey lined pixels happened once so far and lowering graphic settings a lil and restarting the game fixed it-PERFORMANCE TIPS-PC specs (i5-6400 / GTX 960 4GB / 16GB) - I been lowering high demand graphic settings like Post Processing	 Effects	 View Distance	 Dynamic Shadowing to Med for my setup	 doing this helped decrease stuttering and smoothed it out. I'm getting 48-60 fps with Res at 70 on Med / High graphic settings"

Its great when you find all your gear in a dangerous place like the airfield and make it out without a scratch killing 1 person and sneaking past another. The people that are giving bad reviews just because they died to another person are so dumb we are prisoners probably the most dangerous people	 the game is called scum after all we are scum people why would a murderer change his ways on an island where there are no consequences to your actions. The first time i died i got killed by a mech was I mad	 a little but it showed me how powerful the mechs really are but the risk reward is worth it. This game had a way better launch than dayz and it seems like its gonna be great with allthe crafting you can do. I can see it now in the future with base building rp servers and cars armored up with roof panels. This game gives me the enjoyment of back when i was playing dayz mod origins. And i will continue supporting this game."

Ill keep it to see if it gets better with new content	 but id really recommend buying something else.. youll be bored or annoyed in no time 4/10"

Players are teleporting and there are frame rate issues. Other than performance issues and lag it is a pretty cool concept and has a DayZ feel to it which I like. Buy it if you wanna see it evolve or want to try it out. You shouldn't have a problem if you have a high end pc. This game has some mechanics that makes it different from other survival games and it has potential. It is also really cheap when compared to an unfinished game like DayZ.

You run around doing nothing but searching copied layouts of houses and finding plastic scissors more than food or anything else for that matter. God forbid you get your hands on a gun	 but don't have the magazine or any bullets. You can search town after town after town and find nothing but plastic scissors. I don't know what kind of zombie apocalypse this was but the items that are available are hilarious. I'd say 90% of the places that have good loot are patrolled by super mech robot things that are apparently on the zombie's side as they only shoot at you	 not the flesh eating zombies. I ran around with an empty M1 for hours trying to find a car battery to make a lead plate to make some bullets for it. Only to search half a hundred cars and find absolutely nothing in every single one. I don't know who decided that rare of loot was a good idea but I literally just spent the last 12 hours running around to each town (that wasn't patrolled by super robots) and still had not found a single round of ammunition	 a single magazine to ANY weapon	 nor a shred of edible food. Thankfully I found out I could easily cook the abundant Puppet zombies. Overall	 I found this game an extreme time waster. Need animal hide? Better get a damn gun because the animals seem to be ghosts when you sneak up on them and take a swing with the only weapon you have	 probably a club with nails. I swear	 next time I find a pair of scissors in a damn microwave I'm going to set off a nuke in that house."

You are not getting a full 60$ game here so dont buy it with that expectation. The game is a ""dayZ"" survival style with more zombies	 animals	 and robots. keep in mind i dont like to use dayz as the example because that game is dead and riddled with more bugs than my stank nerd♥♥♥♥♥ This game has a great arcade style feel like pubg but with a great in depth survival system that keeps you on your toes.

Choppping up zombies to cook them is ok. All the bugs and issues that come with an early access game never bothered me no big deal. Its just the expanse of wilds is so vast like you are really Jeremiah Johnson out there. The lone tree that falls in the woods when noody is around	 well you are the one to be there to hear it. Zombies are a non issue you can clear out a town with a crude stone knife or climb a latter toss a grenade to attract all in town and pick them off with a .22 hunter 55 rifle	 both get old fast. pvp... I guess its ok when it happens	 usually I never knew what direction I was hit from even when in a bunker. crafting is there for sure but most of the stuff you just dont need or isnt worth the hassle to make stew soup for instance. It takes a huge pot to make it that takes a giant section of your main bag to carry it. So you need to carry all these ingredients like vegetable oil	 salt and vegetables in the event you run into a big pot or just forget it and eat from the endless supply of MRE meals and canned goods found in any bunker. Or BBQ zombies if bored. The whole pee/poop thing	 it is neither here nor there but it is definitely in the game. You can get hypothermia	 diarhea	 and all these other illnesses	 i almost always carried a pharmacy	 pills are everywhere for a variety of  sickness. The robot base guards follow simple paths and patterns are not a problem unless they shoot through walls I am sure that will be resolved at some point. A goat nailed me in the balls once then I made a bear hat from another encounter.  After 60 hours I no longer have any none zero desire to treck around looking for something to do. I don't know if i have done everything it sure feels like I have. Oh and i played with some friends	 that was cool for about 10 minutes before they were bored and wanted to pubg or something else. I think the game would be better with half or more of the map removed."

I really enjoy Scum as it is already	 just had my first adventure	 and what a exciting experience it was. Took me right back to glory days of DayZ. ( In its beginning	 not as it stands today. ) I have been exploring	 and participating in gun fights. With people lagging every witch way	 people of diffrent skill or knowledge of play all trying to fulfill our destiny. what ever it will be	 and it was awsome. I simply had a blast	 laughing and cursing as i made my own way thru. Until i meet my final stop	 and it was my time to catch my bullet. Saddly i become a victim of KOS but thats also a part of the wild and unforgiving life of Scum. If he was me	 i woud do the same.

513710	0	0	76561198308653595	32	8	-1	75.2	September 3	 201	Ok so there is a few major problems with this game that i feel like everyone should be aware of. there is a major memory leak you can only play for an hour or 2 without your frames going to 10 and you needing to reopen the game. along with the looting system wich is also broken you can only find weapons and ammo that are usefull in military bases. that are overun with players since there is only like 15 of them and 64 players in a server so there is never any loot in the bases and if there is good luck getting past the mechs that can snipe you down even if they see so much as a toenail off your body. so as of right now i would deffinetly not reccomend this game to anyone. buy a game like miscreated were atleast the looting works and the map is overun with loot in any type of house.

YES it is! for 20 bucks u get a very fun time alone/with friends and its totally worth it.PROS:-great survival experience	 running around looking for food (proteins	 carbs fats etc) is really fun and interesting-hunting is a really cool feature	 well done mechanics-mechs and puppets(zombies) are pretty fun	 mechs can be a bit glitchy and wallhack you	 but generally pretty fun and a great addition to areas with sick loot.-realism is also pretty great	 gettin injured	 bleeding out and time to kill by riffles is very realistic and makes every second of the game much more exciting.CONS:-i personally think the map is too big. meetin up with friends takes ages if u dont get lucky spawns near eachother( or u can suicide and lose RP)	  too much runnin in areas with nothing around. not to mention u can be playin around for hours  and not see a single person unless u go to a millitary zone.-alot of vilages with very low loot spawns	 literally a whole village and all u find is useless stuff	 a shirt and a piece of candy(when u took like 15 minutes runnin to that village).-gunplay doesnt feel realistic at all. guns are way too easy to shoot and have very little recoil and i think it kinda ruins the realistic aspect of the game.overall i love the game	 WORTH THE MONEY	 and has some new and unique aspect to it	 of course it needs polishing	 but so far im a fan of these devs	 and really REALLY hope they will put alot of work  into this game	 unlike other EA titles."

The map is nice. Puppets are great. Robots are a nice addition.Optimization is poor but with enough tweaking	 you can get acceptable FPS ( in my case acceptable is 75 fps ) on lower end PC ( like mine ). The game has a enough content to enjoy for many hours. The price tag is perfect.8.7/10 for me."

It is interesting if you have patience as the map is huge and zombies are quiet challenging. If you don't have patience then don't waste your time and go play something else. Obviously game is unfinished but it's playable and i'm glad it has been released.Once again game has a lot of stuff in it	 therefore take your time and explore. For early access it's 7/10 rating from me	 but i'm sure it will reach 8 and 9 as time goes by."

Atm it seems people are out to kill not team up so getting an weapon and being good at melee is a must in my book. pleasantly surprised by the graphics and look of the game	 scenery looks great.   Character models are ok but limited so im guessing there will either be a lot of paid for DLC to get away from generic which is already seen in the first release.  Maps are large and right now with max 66 people in a server there is little action until you reach the main towns or robot controlled areas.. the zombies are easily by passed or killed if your bored and the robots are really dumb machines.Its EA and looks like it will need a lot of fleshing out on the game mechanics side.  Controls tend to be standard although the initial bind on sprinting for some reason wa done on the mouse scroll wheel...go figure... but you can change it... havent run into any major issues or bugs ...oh and stay away from goats .. if you hear it bleat...run they are more deadly than any robot in the game..."

Dont jump out of 2nd story windows	 you will get hurt and die f you dont patch your wound. Most frustrating part of the game is the crafting I think. I found everything to craft ammo	 only to find out that I didn't have enough skill to craft it. Best part is you can log out of the server and log back in at a later date and start from where you left off. All in all	 this game has potential and could be very successful. Depending on the DEVS.

If you enjoyed that game (I didn't) then I could recommened this as that dated game needed a face lift on graphics and this game is pretty much it. Take said I only gave it about an hour and a half. In that time didn't obtain one weapon neither melee or ranged.  It was just like Day-Z run around endlessly for bits and bobs once in a great while.

I'll also change this review.I think Steam Reviews don't do this game justice as you are meant to rate the game itself and not the dedication of it's team.  Given that the devs are very social and respond to criticism I have high hopes that they will continue to improve the game.  If it's all an act	 then bravo to them	 they made a sucker out of me.  Hopefully that's not the case.The bad:  The crafting is minimal at this point.  The gunplay is very poor.  Armor does nearly nothing and firearms do extreme damage.  Loot table is either nothing or everything.  Don't expect friendly players as you lose all you have when you die	 meaning trust is generally high risk low reward.  The map is huge and players are small.  You cannot spawn next to your friend in the beginning	 meaning meet-ups might take between 5 minutes to an hour.  All of these issues can be remedied	 however.  I won't rate this negative given it is early access and the devs need all the support they can get.The good: It's just... Fun.  I don't know how to explain it.  I hope the devs never pander to the masses	 I don't want another normie game.  SCUM has something different going for it and I hope the devs stick to their image.  There is an extremely in depth metabolic system.  I hope in the future I can get scurvy and go blind and convulse on the ground.  Tools have levels of utility	 and if you have skills to compliment them you get higher or lower resources.  Scissors cutting up a shirt will get more rags than a sharp rock	 for example.  Animals can be butchered for realistic amounts of food	 so a single deer can feed you for in-game weeks.  People can also be butchered...  The weapons have a realistic ballistic model	 and they HURT.The anticipated:  There are a few firearms in the game	 and most of them are very high tier military weapons.  In the future	 there will be weapons of poor quality	 like double barrels	 revolvers	 breach load rifles	 bows	 etc.  Hopefully this offsets the loot tables so you can pick up a revolver in the towns and head to the military areas with something.  Health system is extremely basic. Now when you get hurt	 you bandage.  I want to perform surgery on my friend who has an arrow lodged into his knee forcing him to walk slower.  In the future	 the medical system will be overhauled.  Few things can be crafted.  In the future	 many things can be crafted.  Vehicles do not exist in the current version.  In the future	 they will.  I'm excited to row a boat I crafted only to get shot from 400 meters away	 forcing the person who killed me to swim to my boat.  Kidnapping players.  During a stream	 devs spoke of this.  Netcode.  This is the biggest one that I imagine will be the most difficult to solve.  Once this is fixed it will make the current PVP actually interesting."

Their vision systems is really interesting and offers a third person game without the third person camera abuse. The metabolism screen is scary at first but you quickly get the gist of it. Having a Fame score ultimately gives you a goal once you are all geared up and survival is no longer an issue. Finally	 the world itself looks amazing. The fact that we got both zombies and assault Mech is also very cool. The Mech can be a bit buggy when they detect you through walls but they will probably fix this. I frankly don't think of much downsides even if the game is only early access. The future of this game looks quite bright."

This title might not be everyones cup of tea but I thought I'd just break down a quick pros and cons of gameplay elements/mechanics I have come across in my first 10 hours. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS Theres groundwork for a comprehensive crafting system with elements of base building and fortifying already in place for future development.  The melee combat is tight and is all about timing your swings (haven't taken on multiple enemies) The skills system has potential but in its current state is somewhat lacking.  The stealth mechanics work as well as you'd expect	 hiding in a bush camoflages you fairly well and you can sneak up behind zombies with their back turned quite well.  It looks beatiful	 even running on high settings. I've had two crashes in my 10 hours and a few stutters but nothing serious. Compatibility and optimisation needs work but isnt as horrible as everyone says. (I have an NVIDIA GTX 970 4gb) The vitals and metabolism stats are so comprehensive that its almost overwhelming the first time you look at them. But they are easy to work out.CONS The shooting mechanics are rarely impressive	 long range shooting can be hard and the bullet drop of for some guns (especially the pump shotgun is not accurate). You can head glitch through some textures and be able to see through walls. Loot spawns in singleplayer are average at best. Placing storage and shelters is strange and the placement doesnt always go to the same place. (It pops out the back right side of your player) Finding clips is extremely rare. There isnt enough explaination of the crafting system	 and there arent even that many things you can build.  There is too much forest for such a large map	 more settlements and loot spawns need to be added.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So theres a short list of the pros and cons I have found. Considering this game is super early access	 fully lacks a tutorial of any kind (maybe thats the point)	 has a completely underdeveloped wiki (so you basically have to work out alot by yourself) and any lack of direction in terms of what to do other than survive	 it has charm. Although its not even close to being as comprehensive as ARMA 3	 its array of mods and its community	 I dont think SCUM is trying to be that. Its more of a better developed earlier access spiritual successor to the failed DayZ project.  Keen to see how far this project goes	 with continued support and communication from both devteam and community	 SCUM could go a long way and truely be something special or be cast aside to an ever growing backlog of survival shooters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

I've played this game probably too much the last couple of days and im enjoying it. Looted a few military bases and got pretty geared but not sure what to do next. PVP is kinda unenjoyable at the moment due to desync	 but hey	 its been in EA for only a few days. I'm sure they're working on that as we speak. So far the devs seem to be on the ball and frequently reading the reddit post.-Graphics are great	 optimization is not so great. On my i5 1060 12GB i get about 50fps on medium	 but drop heavily while rendering cities. I know thats not a super powerful rig	 but still. -Metabolism system feels fresh and keeps you on your toes.-""Puppet"" (zombie) AI is a little annoying but i guess zombiez IRL would be prettty annoying too-Inventory system is great in some aspects and awful in others. Obviously inspired by Tarkov but not executed very cleanly	 chest management is quite a frusterating chore for a gamer with OCD.-Gunplay feels a bit arcade-y but still nice-Loot is well balanced	 somewhere between Miscreated and pubg lol. Feels realistic.  Police stations are a good place to find weapons and light armor in early game.-Military bases are a scary and pretty intense areas. high risk high reward.Well this review ended up being way longer that I expected so I'm going to stop now or else ill just keep goingTL;DR -Game is fun	 I like it. Not a whole lot of things to do quite yet but a great Survival game. Refreshing if you like the genre and a good game to get into if your new to the genre. If PVP will make or break it for you	 wait until it gets better."

513710	0	0	76561198799755405	40	3	1	26.2	September 2	 201	"24 hours played.Scum. A fresh new game that takes everything we know and love about survival games and multiplies it by ten. There’s a lot to love and as of right now	 not much to hate. Please note that I have never reviewed a game before so lets give this a shot.As you would expect	 you spend the first few minutes creating your character before you get thrown into a 144km map with nothing more than a prison jumpsuit that has only a few inventory slots. The character creation doesn’t seem like much and appears to be very straight forward but it’s one of the most crucial things starting out in Scum. Your character's ability to survive is dependant on the stats that you enter. An example of this is if you create a character a bit more on the chunky side	 you’ll have more health	 however	 you’ll lose stamina	 endurance and your overall wellness will be lower. If you go with all muscle	 you’ll be able to run fast and run for much longer but you would need to eat A LOT of calories and not only calories but healthy calories.It’s important to find a good balance when creating your first character. It’s your only chance to do this unless you spawn into a new server so again	 it’s all about balance and how you plan to play. I made my character very skinny and lightweight that way I was fast on my feet but I also don’t require much food. The tradeoff is that I don’t have much health and can very easily be taken out with just a single bullet in the right spot.Once you create your character	 Scum is a lot like other survival games. Spawn in	 scavenge	 craft and work your way up the ranks. It doesn’t take long to get a good set of gear - it all depends on where you’re looking. I wouldn’t waste your time in regular houses unless you’re looking for clothing and random items like scrap metal or a can opener. You MUST risk it for the biscuit. Airfield	 bunkers	 camps	 police stations	 etc. Those are of course the most popular areas so your odds of running into someone is greatly increased but that is where you’ll get the backpacks	 guns	 ammo	 military clothing and so much more.Anyways	 there are a lot of little things that I love about Scum. For the rest of the review	 I’m going to be using a pro/con list just to go over some things that I love and some that I don’t love. Once some time has passed and some updates have been released	 I will be updating this review as I go.+ Graphics/audio. Both the graphics and audio in Scum are fantastic. If you’re able to play at higher quality settings	 you’ll be more than pleased. The audio is extremely directional making it very easy to spot the area that a gun was fired. Or maybe a zombie/animal that is close. The sound effects of guns reloading and firing are all wonderful.- Performance. With an overclocked i5-8600K and Asus 1060 6GB	 I average about 40-50FPS and I don’t think I’ve seen it over 60. I know that it isn’t my system so I only blame optimization but I sure hope this is addressed sooner than later because I’d really love to see what medium and high quality settings look like at 60FPS. Or more. I play on a 2560x1080p monitor (ultrawide) but even when rendering down to 1920x1080	 it’s no different.+ Game balance. Everything seems very well balanced from crafting	 scavenging	 etc. No weapons seem extremely weak or overpowered	 etc. I think the DEV did a fantastic job with this before releasing to the public. Although	 I do think the food/digestion system needs a bit more work only because it seems like I can never eat enough and by the time it finishes digesting	 I’m still hungry due to the amount of calories I typically burn running around the map.- As mentioned above	 I do play on a 2560x1080p ultrawide and at that resolution	 quite a bit of the HUD and screen are cut off unfortunately. An example of this is on the crafting menu	 the “CRAFT” button doesn’t show up at all. I have to close the food menu in order to craft something.+ Replayability. This is just one of those games that won’t get old for a long time. This will get far better with updates when more crafting and what not is introduced but even at its current state	 it’s more than replayable to me.In all	 it’s a fantastic game that I really enjoy. I have absolutely no problem with supporting the developers in the meantime and I won't be docking the review for any of the negative aspects above. I'm sure they will be addressed in due time so for now	 it's a 5 star game. As long as I see somewhat frequent updates/fixes	 this should be THE BEST SURVIVAL GAME to ever be released."

Brings back the feeling I had when I played Dayz Mod.  A huge world with so many possibilities.   So far 50/50 on bandit or friendly player interactions.  The military bases and compounds are insanely scary with the threat of other players	 puppets (zombies)	 and giant mechs that will kill you in seconds if caught in the area.  The military compounds are all over the map with a great risk to reward balance	 with plenty of civilian towns in the mix for more common loot and friendly player interactions.  So far I love all the mechanics.The bad.Server restart alot.  There are many moments of server lag	 small stutters	 memory leak frame loss	 low tick player updates	 and poor in game voip.  The net code or master server load has some fairly big issues.  Many of the health systems are not fully implemented	 though a huge number of the are.  Over all its mostly technical issues that plague this game.  I reccomend the game fully	 but hope performance is the largest focus of the dev team for all of the beta/full release.  Stability will always trump features with the game beings as fleshed out as it is now."

Although the game still lacks of many content	 I can't blame devs because they did a titanic job during last week by fixing major server issues and the game itself is only a week old. Sorry for my previous discouraging review	 but I was chagrined that just when I bought Scum I wasn't able to join any multiplayer session right away - I've quiet bad experience with couple of other early access titles	 that's why I reacted so badly. It wasn't fair to say these words about the game	 since devs works very hard to fix current issues with game's performance	 network stability etc. I hope you will succeed in finishing this game	 because it has a tremendous potential which no game has ever reached. And now cut to the chase. What I did like about the Scum is very flexible crafting system	 which allows player to use many alternative parts/ingredients in the specific recipe. I was stunned by amazing military underground bunkers which have a giant storyline potential	 which could serve as the best team-oriented base/hideout in the entire game as well. The only issue I see so far is obviously a net code which makes player interaction very hard if not impossible due to constant warping.To sum up: after first 2 hours of technical issues and successfully joining my first online session  I found Scum to be very interesting game with a lot of potential. For me it eats DayZ for a breakfast	 not only because of said development and storyline potential	 but the very quick addressing any game related issue.

SCUM is more fun than it has any right to be right now - as the majority of the content has not even been added into the game yet. The developers are active in the discussions and Reddit community	 and more important than that; they listen. This is a survival game first and foremost. You shouldn't buy this game if you're looking for a *constant* fast-paced action thriller	 but that doesn't mean this game cant be fast-paced	 or filled with action	 or thrilling. There is nothing more thrilling than desperately searching through crates for a single 9mm round for the pistol you just found because you've heard another player enter the same bunker you're in. It is terrifying to then creep around the hallways	 sweeping each corner expecting to see them waiting for you. SCUM is amazing. I will never not advocate for people to play it."

Upon trial	 its actually quite very complex and challenging with all the meters and things you have to maintain while not having a direct tutorial or how to do things. Upon 80 minutes playing the game	 I started running around	 scavenging and trying to craft items ( too many items or ingredients with not much knowledge or guide on what theyre for ) and ended up having a full inventory of items with 0 craftables. Graphics wise	 the game is quite promising although when night time hits	 its quite difficult to look around with the pitchblack screen with the probability of getting killed by zombies or robots. ( which happened to me soon after ) I guess the game has a long way to go and might be better of played by casual players like me once its already ready.

You have to learn a lot of new mechanics like metabolism which inludes calorie balance and vitamins intake	 walking/jogging/running	 no 3rd person peeking	 tracking animals	 crafting which is kind of different	 cooking	 etc.Map is 12x12 kilometers which is maybe too much at this stage of the game. However	 developers have promised vehicles so that makes sense. Map environment	 which is inspired by Croatia	 is astonishing. Throughout the world you can find military bases	 military bunkers	 small cities with police stations and a few points of interest like airport	 dam and railway.There are few types of AI in the game. Mech (robots) are guarding the high loot military areas and they are pretty badass	 so it's a high risk - high reward. Puppets (zombies) can be tricky sometimes	 especially if you have only melee weapons but you can use stealth to avoid them. Animals give you a lot of food	 if you are able to kill them. Sometimes you just wound them but you can use tracking mechanic to find them again.If you are looking for a PVP only game	 I don't think this is a game for you. If you just want to run	 find a weapon and hunt other players you'll get bored pretty soon because you have to take care of your character's metabolism to maintain your energy and stamina regeneration.Current stage of the game is just ok. Servers are getting better each day	 but fps is dropping due memory leaks. Developers have already released four or five patches in the first week of early access which could help you understand how much they want to make a best survival game out there.If you decide to play this game	 I recommend you to join Discord community which can help you a lot at the beginning of your Scum journey."

Developers ""address"" their hacking issues which are immidiately bypassed within 24 hours and their customer service is a joke. This game will fail	 mainly because the hacking is out of control already	 and the only way to avoid hackers is to pay a ridiculous monthly fee for a private server... When trying to address hackers to their customer support; doesnt matter if you tell them the name of the player	 the server your on	 the location and time within that server	 they expect you the be constantly recording for proof - how many people record all the time? Not mention how unknowledgable they are about their own game and pretty rude....So basically they expect their customers to police their game for them... while being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about it..The time up until you deal with a hacker is fun though	 the exploring and killing zombies/players is great fun	 until everything you worked hours or days for is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away in a few minutes because a hacker just teleports to your respawn location -> kills you again -> Repeat.

I know it is only in early access but it is not fun when players are glitching everywhere. And the last biggest issue I noticed is that there are no vehicles to get to places. It is extremely hard to get from places to places and those who can only play for a couple of hours feel that this game is unreasonable as an average person does not have the time to play. Desync and vehicles are probably the two biggest issues currently in the game and if this is not fixed	 players may stop playing SCUM. I love the concept and it would be a great game if pulled off	 but the map is so big and it takes such a long time to travel. For those thinking of buying	 expect some glitches and some frustrations	 but it will be a great game if the developers listen to the community."

I love this game but there is sooo many frusterating moments in it from grinding for hours with a prisoner only to have his life slowly tick away from no apparent reason to spending the majority of your time and energy searching for scraps of food to replenish the energy you spent searching for scraps of food. The detail in this game is mind numbing. After 12 hours I'm just starting to understand how most of the metrics effect the character  and I'm finally able to keep him alive for more than an hour but occasionally he'll just give up the ghost for no reason. I'm pretty sure this is a bug and hope it gets fixed before my frustration gets the better of me and I refuse to play anymore. I understand that this is an early access game and still being developed	 however	 I did pay for this and the idea of having to pay to test out a clearly unfishished game just doesnt sit right with me. There needs to be some sort of tutorial to teach the player how to do what needs to be done. Maybe there isnt a tutorial for a reason. Maybe the player is ment to feel alone and abandoned with no direction or knowledge of anything. Idk. If that were the case	 I think it could have been done better. Crafting	 for example. It took me far too long to figure out even how to craft and some crafting recipies just don't seem to work at all.  The last thing I'll mention has to do with physical harm. For as detailed as this game is	 when the character is hurt and losing life	 the menu is far to vague as to what is actually wrong. ""Sick"" seems to be the multipurpose label so its near impossible at times to know what to do to remedy the problem. Tonight I spent an hour or so watching my HP tick down at a rate of a % a minute till dead. I could not for the life of me	 figure out what had happened and what to do about it. Lost everything I had acquired in the past few hours. SUPER frusterating. Over all	 SCUM is a beautifully rendered	 well detailed game that has a long way to go before I can play without worrying about rage quitting and never returning."

You'll need to at least a few hours to grab any idea on how to play the game	 because the beautiful thing about this game is it chucks you in the deep end and then the pool just keeps getting deeper and deeper and before you know it	 you've died without learning how to swim.You can not go in to this game and expect it to be easy. You will die	 you will get shot at and you will feel lost because you can't figure out how to use something or what you need to live.But	 at that very bottom point of nearly wanting to log out	 ♥♥♥♥ING KA POW	 You're being shot at or a zombie is chasing you and everything you had an issue with is simply thrown out the mother ♥♥♥♥in window because now you're trying not to die so that once everythiung is calm again	 you can go back to trying to figure out what it was you hated so very much.The cons;Bugs - So far there isn't HEAPS	 however the ones I've come across I've sworn at the computer and nearly ragedWhen you go down a ladder sometimes it'll randomly jump you off	 and as I was up high on a silo	 I fell	 died and lost the last 2 hours of my gear. I've also been shot at inside a building with no windows my miltech bots	 again	 died. And you can sometimes not hear anyones foot steps at all.Gameplay - The only con about the gameplay is that there's no info on how to survive. For me	 love it	 can't fault it. For most other people	 it's annoying. But	 I'm 28 and have had to learn a lot of things in my life	 others may be feed by a spoon and won't understand how somethings in life work	 this follows into the game	 a some what beautiful yet hungry angry monster.Out of 10	 as the game sits	 I'd give it a solid 7	 the type you'd want to marry and settle down with	 get a house loan and grow old with.This could be the game of the year for me	 only time will tell.Not that it matters	 but here's my comp specs. I'm yet to see below 80fps with everything maxxed out on 3000 res.nivida 1080ti	 32gb ram 3400	 i7 @ 4.2ghz	 game and windows are installed on their own SSD'sI have ADSL2 and only get lag when I first join the server	 or the servers about to restart."

This game could potentially become very very good! But in its current state? I can't recommend purchasing it if you're looking to get a game that works right out of the box and is full of content. The map is huge and has interesting spots to explore but there is a lack of variety currently in both premade items and definitely in craftable items as things are. I'm sure this will expand in the future and when that happens I'll be happy to change my review to an absolutely glowing one! But the game as it is is just too buggy and unpolished to recommend unless you're just one who loves giving indies a chance like me :)This review is also a non-recommend because the game is still glitchtastic. YES	 I know it is in early access alpha but that doesn't prevent game breaking glitches from ruining the current experience. Just recently I spent 30 minutes sneaking through a military base around robots to get to all those sweet sweet goodies only to find myself become trapped inside a desk	 unable to move	 unable to log in and out to fix it	 and I ultimately just had to quit that official server as there was no other way to get out. I've fallen through the map several times already since I've been playing. Overall the game is a solid concept but the playability just isn't there to recommend buying it. Give it 4 more months of early access development and it'll probably be in a good place to buy the game	 support the devs	 and have a product you'll actually want to play without getting frustrated at the bugginess of it all"

As you can probably imgaine it is very annoying	 especially since you can lose all your progress in the matter of seconds if they happen to kill you.

Yes its day two of early access and yes this game has massive potential	  it's what all of us have been hoping for in regards to a proper hardcore survival game. The mechanics are truly top notch and if the devs are as on the ball as they have been so far	 these issues will get sorted within a few months	 fingers crossed. With saying that	 in it's current form it is far from playable. The number one issue is the netcode. Every server	 every player teleports around 24/7. Pvp is impossible right now unless you get lucky spamming your mouse button or the player is not moving.If you are on the fence	 I would suggest to wait it out until issues are fixed."

What I really like about this game is that you are not forced into engaging other players or going to the best loot locations	 You can craft many things yourself from backpacks to hunting weapons and clothing.The Crafting system is still in its early stages but I like it.What I'd like to see in the future:+More Hunting Stuff ( Weapons	 Traps	 Bait	 Fishing )+More Variety in baseing like different and bigger Shelter Styles+Animal Taming ( Horses & Dogs ) ... Dogs could be used to hunt animals & protect the players shelter+Expanded Cooking 	 more foraging... ( Insects? Herbs? )What I want them to focus on right now:+Better Optimization+Enhancd User Interface ( The Server-Browser is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and we need steam friends intigration... also a party system maybe )+Dedicated Servers ( Your Current Provider is known for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ virtual servers that are just not capable of running this game at its full potential )I can recommend this game for now	 and I will keep updating my review as well as share my expierence later.

Didn't think I would enjoy such a game but SCUM really changed my mind. This isn't a game you can learn after a few hours. It definitely takes time and patience to really learn the ins and outs. That to me makes this game worth it. Something to challenge you and to make you think rather than just shoot at things aimlessly. The learning curve is pretty big so take your time and plan things out. Overall	 I like it and will spend most of my time on this game for awhile."

There still are some desync problems i have experienced	 but once its fixed the game is quite solid for being an early access.There's also some memoryleak problem that makes your fps drop after about 15 minutes in-game	 but it can be ""fixed"" with a memory cleaner program.

Opinions subject to change depending on the outcome of the game	 come year one. For now:Pros- Survive! Eat	 Drink	 Farm materials	 raid mech bases	 and make a small shelter.- Loot simulator- No microtransactions (yet)- Active developers with dedication to making this the best survival game out there- HARCORE survival. Manage and maintain your vital stats down to the very amount of vitamin b12 you're receiving from that wild berry- Fluid AI - None of that BS zombies lagging through you are stupid AI. Although they are easy-ish - they provide a challenge. - No real limit to the amount of people you can play with. With the options of 24-32-64 man servers	 you and all of your friends can jump on a server together and survive.Cons- Not optimized- Promising Early Access- Constant server wipesAt the end of the day	 if Early Access is not your thing dont get this. but if you dont mind that minor detail	 pick it up and start surviving.

For instance	 dying frequently will take ""fame points"" away from you. If you go negative in fame points	 you will have to wait to respawn. In my opinion	 this makes no sense because for me at the very least	 looked for tools for ~25 mins. The developers take a really realistic perspective on the game; however	 making a game too realistic and relatively complex doesn't make the game fun. There is much to discuss but I just wanted to put my opinion out there. So... is this game worth the price? Since this is still in development	 I won't bash it until it fully releases.

The devs are very fast to fix the issues. 3 to 4 patches a week	 that's a good point (Not a Dayz Standalone :) ) The game is beautiful. It seems that the memory leak which drops the fps is gone completely. Run at 80 fps in ultra with a 1080 and an old AMD FX8320@4.0ghz with 8Go DDR3. Not bad at all ! This game is so beautiful and the map is so wide. It's very well optimized in comparison with PUBG. The sentries are terrifying	 I can feel my heartbeat in my chest when i hear 'Prisonner	 leave this area immediately"". But these robots have to respect their line of sight. At the moment they can  see me behind a large trunk on a rock. Not fair...It's the kind of game	 where you can just walk	 and explore the map and feels the environment	 Mediterranean coasts	 forest	 mountains	 lakes	 and ponds. You're a prisoner	 yeah	 but also a tourist in this game. (@devs	 we need a larger fov in fisrt person	 a the sound of the drops on the leaves during a thunderstorm.

This game is empty and feels so boring. The graphics looks nice but they are extremely repetitive. The over complexity of some aspects is there only to hide the fact that the game has not much to do. Expect endless walking in the forest going nowhere. It has no originalty	 it seems that everything has to be a mix between PUBG	 Minecraft and Fornite. Games I dislike deeply. Don't waste your money. What can you expect from the developers of Serious Sam? More annoying garbage. 1/10 - A game should at least be some fun. Hit yourselft with a stone in the feet	 that's funnier than this game."

What i can't overlook at this time is the lack of content. While im sure that the devs are grinding their asses off	 i fear that the game will die in the coming few weeks because of the boredom. The pvp is meh because of people teleporting in cqc (i dont know the exact term) but i know this is top priority to devs so hats of to them for releasing so many patches.While the loot is dispersed very well in my opinion	 i find myself at the end-game too fast on every server because most of the pvp is happening on Airfield. The map is too big to travel on foot which throws exploration of the table but this will be fixed with the introduction of vehicles	 which will hopefully happen as soon as possible.The thing i look forward the most is probably the fortification of buildings	 which sounds like a very interesting idea. I am curious at the execution of this idea just as much as i am scared of it.In conclusion	 I love the game	 I will spend much more time playing this game and I look forward to the future that the devs might bring to it BUT I believe that the game will be worth playing in a few months and not just now.I look forward to changing my review in a few months!"

513710	1	1	Nykoloz	140	45	-1	1.8	September 11	 201	"Very bad launch	 feels super rushed even though they delayed it multiple times	 horrible optimization and server issues.server renting as well... yeah guys dont release dedicated servers make the only way we can use private servers is if we pay a third party that you made a contract with so you get money out of it...Also	 if you join someones private server and they drop items on you and do things to you with their basic admin priveliges you will get permabanned from the whole game.Optimization is horrendous	 i run the game on my i5 7400 8gb ddr 4 ram and Radeon Rog rx 560 4gb which is the amd equivalent of gtx 1050 ti  and the game runs at around 40-50 fps on the lowest preset for me at 768 p resolution.Servers also have severe desync issues as well and there is a huge lack of content at launch that the developer videos promised to be here.All in all to summarize	 this game is not worth buying right now	 the whole map has 8 same model houses recycled all over and the map itself outside of those buildings is very empty	 Zombies pose a little to no threat and the robots are absolutely broken in terms of how much threat they pose. Content is extremely lacking	 servers have a bad net code and can only be bought through a third party service and if you join some players server they have enough power to completely ban you from the game because of faulty anti cheat. Optimization as i said is horrendous and the server wipes happen often when they add new content so you will lose your progress if the devs feel like it.This is a horrible launch and the biggest dissapointment ive had in years of gaming	 i was looking forward to this game for more than a year and was very hyped for it and the developers gave impressions of a game that would have great content at launch through developer videos. It all ended up to be a flop	 considering how incompetent these devs are at content releases and game development in general i strongly expect this to be a second version of DayZ and i highly doubt they will make it out of early access in 2-5 years if they ever will and even when they do i dont expect much. Devs chose bad business practices with the servers which showed how immature they are as developers by not even being able to make a dedicated server function which shows a lot about their development skills and shows a lot to me about the future of the game in within just 2 weeks of its launch.Sad to say this but this game wont last very long even though i was very excited for it. Got a very bad first impression	 and first impressions matter a lot	 even if you guys make this game one of the best survival games of all time i highly doubt i will return to it again just out of the bad taste it left on my mouth the first time i tried it.P.S good job on deleting the discussion i made on steam forums asking for a help with fixing my framerate through file modifications like i do with every game that runs poorly since you guys arent able to optimize the game yourselves	 really shows how mature and community centered you are and how much you care about players	 sad that you even unconstitutionally removed my post which broke literally zero rules. This is the final nail in the coffin for me	 refund request sent out."

I guess you lack basic reading comprehension and missed the fact that this is an early access game.This game is super promising	 the developers seem to be actively watching what the community says and are trying hard to make the game more stable and fix game-breaking bugs/issues. If you know what you're getting into and want to support the game	 by all means buy it and help test things out. Keep in mind you are more or less a tester for the game	 not necessarily a player. Whether you play the game as normal or purposely try to break it your goal is to find bugs	 report the bugs and bring things up within the community discussion boards here and on reddit.What you're in for is a pretty basic survival game with laggy players	 combat logging	 cheating	 and a hell of a lot of bugs. It's your duty as an early access player to endure through all that and help put in the work to report	 discuss	 and test problems in the game. If you are someone who doesn't get upset over getting killed by pure BS and can see past the current issues	 please buy it and support it. Know that this is a really ambitious project that needs a dedicated community to be sure it's steered in the right direction and motivates the developers to continue on with the project.Please don't buy this game if you're skeptical about their claims	 wait a few months and then buy it ;)Devolver	 Gamepires/Pandora	 and Croteam have my utmost respect and confidence."

Online PvP is horrible	 players teleport all over the place even when im playing on a 30 ping server. Guns and items sometimes glitch out of the map which could be annoying	 also logging off and logging back into the server sometimes causes you to lose the weapon you had in your hands. Other than that the game is still lots of fun	 I've been only playing solo for now	 but it seems it could be so much better with a squad or a duo. I am going to recommend this game since the low price is worth a buy even at this early stage. 7/10"

513710	1	0	acoustickazoo	77	20	1	8.1	September 1	 201	"SCUM. A complex game that is DayZ inspired in many ways	 mixed with some elements from The Culling	 a hint of Rust	 a touch of TheHunter: Call of the Wild	 and a whole lot of fun. While there is no anti-cheat in place as of this writing do not let that deter you from giving this game a chance. The premise behind SCUM is that you are a criminal thrown onto an island with other criminals in a type of gameshow like The Culling	 and you need to survive by any means possible. The character customization is pretty minimal right now	 four face options	 a few tatoo options and you can only be male right now. A lot of the sections are grayed out such as crime	 flaws and more whiich leads me to believe there will be a time down the road where you can flesh out why you've been locked up	 what flaws you have and more. For now	 every criminal I have made is in for arson. Before you throw yourself into the midst of SCUM I highly suggest you give singleplayer a go as you won't have to worry about other players	 and you can freely go at your own pace and learn the ropes. When you first spawn in after you created your SCUM	 look at the ground and press F to search for rocks. If successful	 you'll see rocks surrounded by a bluw glow from which you need to press TAB to go into your crafting. The crafting in this game is a bit daunting at first	 but once you start making a few things you'll get the hang of it. You'll want to create a stone knife	 as it will be used for just about everything at the start such as cutting down trees	 shredding clothes into rags	 and cutting up animals if you're lucky to bag one. You start with only THREE inventory slots	 so my suggestion is now that you have a stone knife	 go back into TAB and then your inventory	 and cut up both your prison top and pants. Once that is all said and done	 create rope	 which will unlock the basic courier bag. Create it	 drop it on your guy and now you are good to go with nine slots of space to work with. Don't wander off just yet. You need to defend yourself and that stone knife will only do so much. Find some trees	 or bushes as they kind of work the best	 and cut them down. What you are looking for is long sticks	 and once you have those near you (they do not need to be in your inventory	 as long as they are in the vicinity you can craft with them) you want to craft two wooden spears. There are two holster spots in your inventory (marked 1 and 2)	 drag a spear into 1 and then 2	 and you should see them appear on your back. Now you can defend yourself for the time being in case you run into any zombies	 which brings me to my next point: fighting zombies.So you may have noticed that shift doesn't make you run. You change your speed of run with the mousewheel	 which there are three speeds to choose from: walk (default)	 jog	 and sprint. Try to not sprint around the zombies as that will aggro them from what I tested. I was able to sneak around them while in walk mode	 they left me alone. If you do aggro one	 this is where your spears will be of great use. If you want to melee	 it will take around ten hits to kill a zombie	 which mean you will have to do a lot of bob and weaving and swinging to lay hits on the zombies as they hit hard. The best option is to get some distance	 hold your left mouse button which will bring up a sort of arc system that shows you the trajectory in which the path of your spear will take. Toss that bad boy at the zombie and if you land a hit	 it will go down	 come back up and it will only need one hit to drop. This is a far easier tactic	 and you can get your spear back by hovering over it with your reticle. Holding right mouse button causes your guy to focus in a style that mimics TheHunter: Call of the Wild. When you hunt and animal and it's bleeding	 runs away...run to where you shot it	 hit it	 etc.	 and hold the focus. You can see what type of animal it is	 how bad it's bleeding	 and the path it took as it ran away. Don't worry about your energy level right off the bat	 especially if you start running everywhere. It takes a bit to for it to effect your guy negatively	 and most likely by then you will have found food to replenish it. Oh	 what's that? You've found food and your energy keeps staying where it is	 at a zero? Press TAB and press 3	 which is your BCU menu. Here are a lot of numbers and graphs that probably have you scratching your head. At the bottom there's stomach fullness	 bladder fullness	 colon fullness	 intestine fullness and the like. Guess what? The more you eat	 the more your stomach fills	 which then fills your colon and intestine	 and eventually	 you can hold TAB and select to take a crap. Trust me	 you want to do this sooner rather than later as you don't want to be in a fight with some zombies	 running away from mechs (yes there are giant mechs that guard high loot and are KOS most of the time)	 or another player	 and your guy just drops his pants to take a crap or even urinated because you neglected to keep an eye on all of that. You can overeat and your guy will eventually gain weight after a few days. The reverse of that is your guy can lose weight and become sick if you don't take care of him. So you need to make sure you're not just eating everything in sight	 which will be tempting at first. Explore! There are cornfields	 sunflower fields	 grapes	 olives all growing wild that you will come across. This is why it's wise to jump into singleplayer for a bit	 explore and learn the ropes. Then when you feel you are ready	 jump into a server. Just like DayZ or any other survival game	 don't expect many players to be nice and expect to be KOS. There's probably a lot I have left out	 and that's okay. Learn at your own pace	 explore	 and have fun. This game has loads of potential and I know this was more of a guide than anything so I'll get to the review part. This game is as much fun as it can be frustrating. Keep in mind that if you create a character on one server	 and then want to go to another	 you have to start over. Also	 when you join a server you are possibly and realistically up against people who have grinded a long time	 have guns and will show you absolutely no mercy. Even as a naked criminal with a spear	 they'll down you. I highly recommend SCUM	 as the potential is there	 the devs are active and have talked about adding a lot of amazing things (hey you want to go fishing to get food? Do it.). Again	 this game is in EARLY ACCESS. It shouldn't have to be said	 but it will be: expect bugs	 changes	 hackers	 cheaters	 something you liked about the game going away	 something you hate about the game being added. It's all part of the deal. If you have a few friends who want to play a new game	 try this. If you are down to give this game a chance	 ride the waves of the changes and being in EA	 go ahead and go have a blast because SCUM does a lot of things right. Do not let the mixed reviews throw you off. Enjoy!"

On a good server or solo game you can actually get caught up in the immersion.  There are problems	 the game can be arcadey	 and it does have a slight player lag	 but beyond this I still feel like I have to recommend this game.  I encourage you to join for the journey of making a really good game.  Don't buy this game if you want a perfect and complete game	 because its very far from that.

It's fun	 but you will want to bring a friend or two or a few. If you go it alone	 you need to be very crafty	 or just avoid the gunfire. Choose your character's talents: muscled up melee man	 sneaky sniper	 lightweight marathoner	 and so on. Live off the land like a mountain man	 far from towns	 or raid camps	 towns	 and military zones for some sweet loots. Silently chuck a spear into a zombie head	 or noisily blast them and call up their undead companions. This game has a unique camoflauge scheme that rewards methodical sneaking and nerfs third person corner peeking. The game also has one of the most detailed physiological simulations: eat too much	 puke. Eat some nasty cabbage	 blast your colon out. Neglect your full bladder	 and you might drop pants to whiz right during a zombie fight. Carry too much stuff too far too fast	 get hyperthermia	 heat stroke	 pass out. Constant updates from CroTeam (of Serious Sam fame) keep chipping away at the rough part	 which is server lag most obviously. The roadmap promises bases	 safe zones	 vehicles	 more talents	 more items	 and so on. It's easily worth the $20 for the early access	 which is the final judgement criteria for this player."

You are going to spend first 10 minutes of your spawn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere due to eating the first♥♥♥♥♥♥you meet around and this is going to lead you to diarrhea.You can't basically die of starvation because you can eat human meat so you just have to kill an isolated zombie	craft an improvised camp fire and a skewer with meat (can't eat raw human steak apparently) to cook it.Map is wide: 12x12 kms are enough to spend a full couple of hours to cross the whole map.PvE is hard enough to be fun	also enough to be stressing if you're a newbie or you are not paying attention.There is ALMOST no way to defeat the big bots patrolling the military areas and also no way to defeat more than one zombie at a time with melee weapons (the only chance you have got is to climb over a wall or to rush in a house and slam the door behind you: they can't open doors nor break them down).If you are hit by a zombie	chances are the next hit is going to land on you and not on your opponent: due to animation and stamina recovery zombies are as fast as you to hit you with their arms	while you swing your axe.Keep in mind that if you want to kill something/body you have to aim for the head.You can throw axes by simply hold Left Mouse Button	if you manage to hit the head you will make it dead.Same for the hunting ambushes: wait for the deer to stand still and aim for the head	otherwise you will just hurt it and it will flee.Be advised: boars and goats can harge you is they see you while you sneak on them	they usually knock you down for more than a couple of second and flee at supersonic speed so you won't be able to track them again once they're gone (damage is about 20-35% depending on speed of charge (so if they run towards you from further they will make you more damage) and wildlife's body size.Going back to starvation: a single deer can provide you a number of steaks that simply can't be counted (about 50)	also if you chop its parts you will get pieces of fat too	over the steaks; so now you've got 50 steaks with any of them divided into three portions and 50 pieces of fat multiplied for 10 portions each.Don't waste food: only hunt deers when you are playing in group and every one of you is really really hungry.If you are alone just focus on an isolated zombe and cook some delicious human steaks."

Currently	 there seems to be a memory leak so I would recommend restarting the game if you notice a drop in frames. If you are a fan of the open world survival genre	 this is well worth the 20 bucks. A word of advice: don't let getting military gear be your only idea of an endgame	 especially with how insane the robots are right now. Learn the map	 how to craft	 and how to be stealthy.

It didn't disapoint	 I got geared easy enough whilst getting chased about by zombies	 the controls felt smooth	 looting felt great and buildings looked detailed.Then a mech shot me. RIP.GameplaySo SCUM plays out like your typical survival game only there are some major differences to the likes of DayZ	 H1 and <generic failed survival game here>Third personIn SCUM you have the option on all servers to play in third or first	 the choice is yours. However do not expect to use the third person camera to look around corners as the devs have implemented something wonderful...you can only see what your characters eyes can see	 even if you are in third person. I was very apprehensive about SCUM with it being primarily a third person game due to the way people cheese the mechanic so this new feature is very welcomed and any dev in the future would be a fool not to have a similar mechanic in their game if they want any element of realism in it. Bravo devs.Food and waterGone are the days where you eat anything and everything to fill up a merry little green bar that represents food.Enter SCUM and the memories of your childhood being told to eat your greens	 as in SCUM you'll need to eat a healthy balance of food ranging from other players legs to wild bears	 layered with a sprinkling of chocolate and vitamin pills and you're good to go.Whilst initially it's quite daunting and you might find yourself starving you need to remember SCUM is	 in a sense	 a realistic game so you can go a long time without actually eating	 you will also soon find that food and drink isn't actually that hard to find as unlike other games it's not just about looking every building hoping from scraps. You can hunt animals	 you can pick corn fields	 grab apples from trees or hell kill a ""puppet"" (zombie) chop him up and cook him! Daunting at first	 but I love it and it's a fresh idea.The worldThe world of SCUM has been carefully created with twisting hillside roads leading over bridges	 through tunnels and around various picturesque locations.As you run around the map it's easy to see how much time and effort was put into creating the world	 some locations are breathtaking (especially if you have the graphics up!). You have roadside cliffs that tower above small farming towns	 military bunkers guarded by robots that hate socialising and buildings that are not just copy and pasted 1 floor houses but giant prison blocks with multiple floors and some even with basements	 they're a maze of rooms filled with thought out interiors...the list goes on	 in short	 it's feels great to enjoy the world you spend so much time running around.EventsWhilst playing in the free roam world of SCUM you earn ""Fame points"" this is essentially your currency and currently it is used for two things	 respawning and events.At any point you can buy into an event	 for example team deathmatch. There are a few different types and locations which are played out in a instance seperate from the free roam world	 your main character is removed from the world and is safe	 if you die in these events it does not effect your free roam character in any way and once you're done you are put back into the world.These are great fun for getting a feel for the guns	 practicing combat in various locations or if you just want some quick action with no drawbacks; they are also a good way to make fame should you win.RespawningCurrently respawning has the following options:25 Fame : Spawn in random location50 Fame : Spawn somewhere in the map grid you died75 Fame : Spawn at your campsite (should you have placed one)100 Fame : Spawn on squadmateThese all work great but my only issue is with the last one	 spawning on squadmates. This really needs tweaking so you can't spawn on your squad if there is a conflict in the area much like how it's done in ARMA as currently it's fairly easy to get fame so whilst 100 sounds like a lot it's really not and means the squad you're shooting at will respawn almost on top of each other multiple times before you can drive them out of the area.Hopefully this will be changed soon.RatingFor an EA title that has been out around a week it's already proven to be better than other survival games on the market	 the devs have also been pushing out patches almost daily to fix the major issues	 even working all hours on Sundays.It shows great promise and is very playable	 priced at $20 it's easilly worth picking up if you enjoy these games.1-2-3-4-5-6-7-[8]-9-10Controls / CraftingFigured i'd throw crafting in here as it is loosly related.The controls are pretty generic and don't really need to be talked about too much	 everything functions as intended and are bound in ways that feel comfortable from the get go.One thing you will notice different is sprinting is done with your mousewheel	 it's strange at first but it grows on you as it enables you to go from jogging to sprinting in no time at all and if need be straight back down to walking; if you've played Escape From Tarkov imagine how they have done their various crouch levels but with sprinting instead	 sounds strange	 but it works. Also I hope they add the Tarkov style precision crouching	 it would be a welcome addition.Crafting at first can also be a bit confusing	 it took me longer than I care to admit to learn how to actually do some simple tasks like opening a can of food	 you would think if you have a can opener and a can in your bag you'd be able to simply right click the can and open it	 however you need to select your can opener with left click so it highlights it (or a knife / similar sharp object) and then the food which will then give you the option to open when you right click the food.This is how you do various interactions with objects in the world	 should you want to light a fire then you select your matches / lighter / flint + steel and then select the campfire which will then give you the option to light the fire when you right click the camp site.Crafting objects can take quite a lot of materials	 some of which are too large to lug around but luckily the devs have included crafting from the floor so the objects you need to craft just need to be within your vicinity which makes the crafting process a whole lot smoother.1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-[9]-10Visuals / OptimisationThe game is stunning	 there is no doubt about that. Even if you are playing on low graphics settings you can still see how beautiful the game is.However it is plagued with a few memory leaks	 however a patch has come out that hopefully has fixed this issue but as of writing this review I have yet to try it. I fully believe in the dev team that this will be fixed either in this current patch or in the next few patches as so far they've done nothing but prove they're working on sorting these issues out as a matter of urgency.1-2-3-4-5-6-[7]-8-9-10OverallBrilliant early access title that's cheap and does what it says on the tin with hard working devs that are bringing new ideas to a genre that has been filled with awful let downs.Worth buying if you enjoy a great survival experiance. I could write more but I have ran out of space!1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-[9]-10"

513710	0	0	BentNoodle	53	9	1	13.9	September 4	 201	"When I started this review i was hesitating to recommend it	 because of performance issues	 netcode	 dsync	 connection issues	 and everything of that such	 which can be quite annoying	 but looking at these devs I believe they will be fixed soon. The devs have pushed multiple updates fixing important things such as cheating. It seems like they are very competent and hard working.Now for the pros:• Regarding the possibly confusing metabolism menu	 you really don't have to worry about it if you don't want to	 but it is great for people like me	 who like to micro manage. It's there if you want it	 otherwise you can pretty much ignore it• Character creation is great. While the options for physical appearence is rather limited other than body type	 the skills section is where this game shines. There are many possibilities of skillsets you can have for a character	 and they change how you might play the game.• While there are many good things about this game	 there are many problems I have with it	 even ignoring the bugs;• Inventory UI and crafting UI are very bland and sometimes hard to understand at first. The crafting escpecially	 is not very intuitive	 and the ui looks boring in general.• No end goal. Once you loot one of the big military locations	 there isn't much more to do in the game. While of course it is a survival game	 and there isn't really end games to them	 it would be nice if there was more depth in the game. As of now	 you can spawn right next to the airfield	 and in an hour have as much loot as someone who has been playing all day. This causes the game to get repetitive.• This is controvertial	 but I think either the map is too big	 or the player limit is too low. I feel like seeing players is pretty rare. And while of course pvp is not the main point of the game	 it is still a part	 and I feel like it is not occuring enough. One way to fix this is this is to incentivize looting other areas of the map than the common places right now.• Bugs. And there is lots of them	 including 100mph boars running around	 players teleporting	 getting kicked out of servers	 and other things like this. Although the devs have recently said this is their top priority right now	 so i will edit this once its fixed.In conclusion	 the game is fun	 but there are lots of issues. I bought it	 and don't regret it	 but you might."

I am assuming that this caused the anti-cheat to flag my account. of course when you try to appeal you get a copy pasted reply from easy anti-cheat about your false ban GG bought 2x accounts with supporter packs and both of them got banned now. What a joke

A zombie comes by	 shot it 5 times and it still comes at me. I try to use a shovel to beat the zombie	 the zombie is still alive. I die. Lost all the hours of gear in the random location. I had 75 points	 so i spawned in that sector. Get to my body and it's gliched. Can't pick up any of my gear. Seconds later	 another player snipes me. Get to repeat it. The game is fun	 but it's got it's issues. I'd say wait on the $20 till they get 6+ months of time on servers fixing. Looking forward to a complete product though. btw	 my charactors are always hungry... like	 non stop. lol"

It has plenty of potential and I definitely think it’s worth playing. It’s in early access so you can’t call it a broken game yet. It’s definitely worth investing in."

But DayZ was too buggy	 too broken	 it never had anything really quite right with it. I like a game where I'm not always just engaging in firefights. I am so sick of COD-like games and this is the ideal game for me. I love pacing myself. I love being able to choose my fire-fights. Playing with my friends and coming across a high loot zone ang getting kittet was the most rewarding feeling. Shooting my first zombie in the head and watching him drop 2 feet from me was the best shot I ever too. Zombies ARE a real threat	 but they're not spammed across the map and you can avoid them if you're patient and use stealth. The BCU monitor is also really fantastic. I actually made my skinny character fat after hunting the bear and eating all those bear stakes. So now I'm on weight watchers. Shout out to the devs as well. They are EXTREMELY responsive and they react quickly. In the first hour the servers crashed a lot (if you didn't expect that you have NOT been playing games for very long) but maybe an hour or two after release the devs already released an update that fixed the problem for me. I didn't have a single crash in 7 hours of playing. If you like survival games then this is the game for you. Thank you CroTeam for bringing this amazing adventure to us and letting us experience your world."

Fame points give a Slither.io type of urge to gain more and more points as you fight / gather / survive your way to the top. The great thing about it is you can actally gain a competitive amount of points just from crafting and surviving. The Food system although complicated at first	 is a great way to prevent people from just stacking up on meat when they have attained guns as all nutrients/ foodtypes are tracked. Most people I have run into are friendly since no one knows how to play well. The farthest along ""early access"" game I have ever played. Worth 20$ 3 times over. And there is more to come !!!"

513710	1	0	SaberToofWuff	97	15	1	27.8	August 30	 201	"Scum is an amazing Survival game with a vast crafting system. Although to start it may seem confusing	 eventually (within a few hours) you'll be a pro and be able to understand the game. At first you will more than likely die a lot to various factors. Players that kill on sight	 giant killer robots that harass you at military bases	 sickness	 hunger	 zombies. After you get use to these things and after multiple death	 you'll learn how to not get killed as often. So to start with the postitives	 I really enjoy the crafting. Although you cannot build a full base at this moment in the game build	 you can build a shelter which you can spawn at. To spawn you need to use fame points. To get fame points you can kill things	 craft things	 chop bushes	 pretty much do any action. ITs 25 fame points for a random spawn	 50 for a general area spawn	 75 for a shelter spawn	 and 100 for a spawn on a teammate. To start a squad you just hold ""F"" on a person once you meet up and then invite them. I really enjoy the graphic of the game. It is very beautiful	 but with the difficulty to run the game	 most pc's have to run it on low setting due to memory leaks and lack of optimization. Loot is easy to find	 bullets are not. So you won't have a problem getting geared. This is nice as you will not die to a geared player because you have nothing. With all the good aside	 there are still many things that need to be improved. But	 it is still in early access so I assume these things will be addressed eventually. First is some of the animations are a little wonky. Another major problem due to the large playerbase already	 is laggy server. This makes gunfights and melee fights very awkward as you just punch someone and the next thing you know they are behind you. There are also many bugs and glitches that may make you frustrated. Another thing is the mechs will see you even if you are behind them. They also can see you through wall	 and even on occasion shoot you through them. They only need 2-3 good shot to kill you armored	 so you can see how this gets annoying after your first few deaths to something like this. Another issue is the camera locks on to enemies. This means you could be trying to fight a specific person and the camera autolocks onto other in a melee fight. This can also get you killed when your character locks on to a zombie as your running across an area with robots. YOu will then lock onto the zombie and if you are being chased by a robot	 this can be a cause of your death. There are other issues	 but I overall reccomend the game. It is very fun especially with friends and has great potential. I see this game as DayZ done right	 on launch already. What are you still doing reading this small novel though? Buy the game already its $20 and if you dont like your first 2 hours	 you could always refund it. Zero risk. But	 im confident you won't have to refund as long as you love hardcore survival games."

513710	0	0	76561198078050783	118	9	1	9.0	August 30	 201	"SCUM is currently an early access version of an intricate survival/TV show battle royale game. It's hard to appease both crowds but I think the devs will pull it off. Most of the negative reccomendations are due to bugs/instability/ or failure to understand game mechanics. All of these issues are common with every EA title. The important thing to note is that while SCUM is pretty bare on content in it's current state the overall design is good	 the game looks great and is fairly optimized already. I'm happy to give these people 20 dollars and see what they can do to this title in a year. I would personally prefer a heavier lean towards hardcore survival than what already exists but I'm happy to give these people money and time to flesh this game out and make it great."

I Kinda wish they had waited until either transport and/or base building was implemented as running takes too damn long	 you can be running for well over an hour just to find your team mate.  The map is great	 the map size is great	 movement does not feel clunky at all	 and feels really nice to play. It feels polished thats for sure.  It would be good to see some improved friend/party options so you can see locations of team mates on map	 or be able to add them to a friends list and party without having to run all the way to them just add them and to be able to see their name above there head for 50 meters. Overall great game and will only get better. My main concern is that transport and base updates will take months to roll out  by which time the game will have lost its hype and have less attention than it will deserve."

THE DEVS CARE!!!8.5/10 - A better balanced and optimised DAYZ.Good: Only $20USD	 thousands of servers to play on	 devs constantly updating game	 optimising coming along well	 great loot	 massive map	 solid nutrition/health system	 hilarious with friends	 and great familiar guns/attachments.Bad: Player/animal hitboxes need adjusting	 gunplay between players needs some work (die too fast)	 animals tank sniper shots to the head (LOL)	 Robot MECH's one shot you most of the time	 cant carry bundle of planks in weapon holster slot (like wooden stick bundles)	 cant choose where to place or move crafted items etc: Fireplace/Firepit/Storage Container Long Review:I had been loosely following SCUM's journey since it was announced	 when one day i noticed the devs had listed a release date. Eagerly awaiting relsease day	 it finally came! First impressions were something of pure excitement	 but the somewhat poorly optimsed features along with the many server issues the game was encountering soon forced me into frustration. So i took a 1 week break from the game	 purely to try some other new titles whilst keeping a close eye on the SCUM Devs. After not playing SCUM for a while i suddenly got the urge to try it out again...So i jumped in	 i noticed almost immediately that the menus were smoother and the server selection screen was loading 100% faster. I then quickly created a character and entered a server. I could not believe my eyes... The game was running at very high fps and looked incredibly smooth and beautiful. After some research i quickly realised that the devs had been working their asses off and had rolled out a whole bunch of patches/hotfixes in just 1 week! So with that said ive been paying this game again nonstop since. The loot feels perfectly balanced around the massive map and any average skilled player can become fully looted within 30-45 min of spawning! There are so many individual animals	 weapons/attachments	 edibles	 ingredients	 medications	 melee weapons and crafting tools/recipes. Its just insanely indepth!Its a great thing when you can actually see how much THE DEVS CARE ABOUT THEIR GAME	 ive had some great fun with firends and solo so far and i sincerely wish them the best of luck with all future plans/updates for SCUM and i will be ambitiously awaiting to see what they have in store.

The game measures how many calories you use	 and you need to eat enough to balance your calorie loss vs gain. Running and other strenuous activities use more calories than others. This places importance even on simple movement. What you eat and how much is very important. Eat too much	 you'll be sick. Starve and you'll die. You need to go to the toilet too. Water is also necessary	 you need to stay hydrated.What your character can see	 is what you can see. No more abusing third-person camera to see over obstacles that your character couldn't. This only applies to seeing other players	 but that's the only time it needs to count.An interesting camoflage system. You are literally not rendered to other players if your camoflage skill is high enough vs their awareness skill. This stops people from adjusting graphics to remove grass and bushes to gain an advantage. This lets people play the game the way it's meant to be played	 without other players abusing the system to their advantage.Not just other players as danger	 but also zombies and robots. All this	 and it is still in early development. As time goes on SCUM will become an even more incredible game than it already is	 which will be exciting to witness and enjoy.Get in early now and git gud."

Nothing like some human steak to take the edge off those hunger pains. If you enjoy survival games	 I'd recommend giving SCUM a try.

But it is miles better than many Early Access releases.I would personally say that the game in its current state is worth the price	 from the 8hrs I've played so far I've had great fun. There is plenty of content already and more is on the way. Judging from the dev's communication I'm confident that they can iron out the issues and deliver what they promise. Frankly	 as long as the netcode is sorted to make PvP more reliable then I would have absolutely no qualms with recommending	 as it is I'm still willing to do so thanks to the other content in game and the currently low price.Yes its another survival game	 but the content it provides is a good blend of what we've seen before with some refreshing new ideas.

Will update when they're sorted out.As far as the game goes	 it's basically DayZ with a little more depth and a lot more players.  So	 it will be a good game if you enjoyed DayZ/H1Z1 (before they gave up on survival)/Miscreated.  Performance is good.  I know others are complaining but I'm having no issues on that front.  4790K/GTX 970/16GB of RAM.  Changed the settings to High and dialed back the shadows a step and it runs smooth at 1080p.After the first hour the server disconnects chilled out and I thought the game was working good.Finally get a gun	 hear a guy in a building next to mine	 get into a fight and he's teleporting all over the damn place.  Aiming at his head	 pull trigger	 he teleported damn near behind me and blew my head off.I'd hold off on buying until the network issues are fixed unless your idea of a good time is spending 3 hours looting a bunch of gear just to lose it in an instant due to♥♥♥♥♥♥server performance. Expected disconnects on day 1	 but they really need to sort this♥♥♥♥♥♥out.   Server was half full so it's not like it was overloaded or anything.  Disappointing	 especially since they delayed the release to put out even more servers	 which apparently accomplished nothing even though there are 50k players which is what they planned on BEFORE they added more servers.

The few stats you can invest in don't really factor into how you play the game and the survival system showing biometrics and percentages of food intake has no factor due to the fact that food and useful items are just as scarce as they are in Day Z. You won't really care what your sugar levels are at	 or how much fiber is in your diet... you're just happy to find something to fill your stomach. In my opinion it'd be best to wait until this game is out of early access to see if it can distinguish itself apart from every other survival game out there."

Even in early access I thoroughly enjoy the game	 even with the rough edges (bugs	 wipes	 lacking optimization). The metabolism menu offers some creative elements	 add in weight loss/gain and the overall dependency on your physical condition	 small accomplishments feel great. With some fine tuning to the craftic system and the games optimization (sprinkle in additional items and maybe other maps) the game will be that much better once all is said and done. 8/10 would gladly poop in the woods with a chance of being killed by a bear or zombie again."

This game is still a major work in progress	 but still this game is pretty damn fun! being able to survive and play with new 3rd person mechanics is awesome! I love the new third person mechanics implemented into the game	 only being able to see the parts of the person if your eyes can visually see them. I love the fluidity of the characters movements! Scum does have a lot of networking issues to take care of but with these guys doing more for their game in a week than most devs.... They are heading down a very successful path! I will be honest I refunded the title due to the Low FPS I was getting but after a few patches from their release build	 I find the FPS not to be such a huge issue. The game is such a blast! the time to kill is just phenomenal! I love the damage system in the game	 the only thing I think needs work is the frames	 the Melee combat fluidity and the metabolism system in regards to medication and vitamins actually affecting you! Overall the game is addicting and is for both PVE players and PVP players! The game has a singleplayer option which I love! Worth all of of the $19.99 I refunded and re-purchased the game with!"

The mechanics are great	 there's a whole metabolism system for your character	 as well as strengths and weaknesses you spawn with. The idea of the game is good. AS OF RIGHT NOW (9/5/18)	 vehicles are said to be added	 it is a must. The game feels like a runnning simulator	 which I don't have much experience in. The map is very large	 which is a plus (when you can use a vehicle)	 and there is a wide variety of locations/ buildings to go to. I haven't found anything negative with the looting system yet either. My main concern/ problem with this game	 is that when you get in the game	 it feels dead the whole game. Little action. The most action you can get right now is going to the airforce base and sneaking around the robots and finding like 2 other people if you are lucky	 or.... unlucky. This is to the SCUM devs	 please develop more ways to keep the player enganged	 I feel alone in a full server (64/64 players). But I will still reccomend this game	 after all	 it released like a week ago. We need more action! Thank you!"

This game is like the combination of good elements you find in other games but at the same time creates it's own identity. This is a huge level up on survival game genre as this is by far the most complex. You really need to watch every aspect of your body like every vitamins or how many teeth you have. THIS GAME IS FUN	 many will say that seeing your character pee or poop is the most fun thing about this game but I beg to disagree	 it is the inclusion of MECHS. I haven't been this thrilled raiding a base cause this mechs can literally kill you on sight which means goodbye to your hard earned loot	 also their unconventional voice for a robot is so chilling. You either love this game if you love survival games or hate it if you don't get what this games are about	 calling it a running simulator will only make yourself look dumb.Probably the best early access game I've ever played. For me they don't need to change anything just optimize the game and fix some bugs then they're ok."

But in case you're wondering about the technical aspect	 On i7-6700 3.4 GHz	 GTX1060 6GB	 32GB RAM	 Win10 64bit	 graphics set to max	 it stayed above 50 fps most of the time except when I crossed the grid line and the game loaded the next area. And I've encountered no game-breaking bug or crash (yet). Compared to Ark and some other more-linear games	 SCUM's optimization is not bad.For solo players	 this looks very promising as a survival game. You kinda get The Last of US/The Walking Dead vibe (without story	 of course). SCUM doesn't hold your hand and it will punish you. If you're not well-equipped	 taking 2 puppets (zombies) head on is suicidal. The puppets have Vulcan hearing and the Mechs have Hawkeye vision. Inventory management is a pain. You'll have to choose between a new-found item	 which might come in handy later	 and food	 which is scarce and you will need it later. If you're attacked and you don't have any first aid kit	 you'll bleed to death. And so on.If there's anything to complain about	 it's the lack of explanation on the basics	 not even the HUD. And with all the graphical options	 there's no brightness/contrast slider. Really?As the development continues	 I hope to see better performance and balance adjustments. And it would be a HUGE plus if the dev would allow solo players to customize their own single player experience like Ark (e.g. more/less wildlife and plant spawn rate	 puppets	 loot amount	 etc.) Also	 controller support would be nice.If you don't mind that the game is still in Early Access	 the single player content of SCUM is already worth its current price."

Wearing the lightest clothes you can maybe sprint for a minute before you drain all your stamina. From there the only method to regain it is to walk. Not jog	 but walk. For 2 or so full minutes just to get it back up. By then	 there goes half of your player's energy. And theyre gonna need something to feed them back up to 100%. Honestly	 with movement on its own so punishing on a large map its just impossible to play. Hardly no locations to loot	 bad loot spawns entirely	 all on a map with a player cursor for you to look at and see every location in the game. For the survival theme I dont know how I feel about maps with cursors and mech AI defending high level areas but it does not feel right to me. If you want my personal opinion on the game. Its far from done. It put too much work into realism that the gameplay	 you know	 the fun part of the game?	 is just gone for me. Realistic in some areas	 broken in others. You might walk your way down to the store in real life	 but no way do I want to literally walk miles in a video game because the systems are too punishing to allow you to push beyond that. I cannot recommend SCUM to anyone really. Unless your $20 really cant be spent someplace else."

No lag	 no stutter (maybe a bit when entering a big area with lots of containers)	 no glitches or bugs that ruined my experience.Currently there's not a lot of content but	 again	 this is an early version of the game. Looting is really satisfying: You need to be extremely careful and time your steps to not get caught by a player or NPC. I also like a lot this new melee fighting system that devs implemented. I'm very satisfied by this game and the price I paid	 knowing that my money is destined to build an excellent and innovative survival experience."

I've been trying all the different aspects of the game instead of just rushing a feedback as most people do.So far	 I just freaking love it. The graphics are just wonderful	 lights	 landscapes	 textures	 effects are pretty solid. The only thing lacking on this side is a little bit of optimization	 frames are not the best out there	 but you get used to it.The mechanics are initially hard to get	 but they're pretty simple once you get the basics of crafting and making items interact between them. Melee fighting against zombies is incredibly fun	 while in PvP is something that has to be improved with better sync. Right now it's pretty messy. Shooting mechanics are really basic so far	 they do depend on your skills and attributes	 but I feel like recoil control could be improved. Also here	 in PvP it's quite weird since people disappear and desync all over the place	 but once you get into situations you find the sweetspot for gunfight engagements. It's incredible the amount of details that are present in the game so far	 the metabolism	 crafting	 scavenging and looting. Playing with a friend who knows a lot about mushrooms	 we could survive walking around the woods just getting edible mushrooms to eat	 but still finding a lot of poisonous or psychedelic ones	 which I personally find fantastic.Visiting bunkers and military outposts is a real adrenaline rush while you try to avoid the mechs guarding the area	 and multiple times I just felt like I was really there	 in a movie scene. I'm really impressed so far. You have to be intelligent and if you have some survival skills on your own	 trust me this game is gonna make them count thanks to the wide mechanics it has. Random encounters with people are really exciting	 right now I have a fellow european survivor	 which I got to know after I almost gave him a heart attack after screaming like a madman: "" GET OUT OF MY BUILDING	 THIS IS MY  BUILDING"" when I heard him approaching... So many fun moments... you know there's some kind of bonding when you both pee on each other legs... Or that time when I was AFK	 just to find one of my squad mates pooping on me when I came back... Absolutely recommended game	 specially when you see devs so committed to improving it and face problematics ASAP."

It feels more like an episode of naked and afraid rather than always being chased by people that want to kill you all the time.  The map is big so you don't constantly run into people.  I love the metabolism mechanics of the game so that	 if i eat a lot	 i have calories stored and dont have to keep eating all the time.  If you know how to survive	 survival becomes not difficult and i think that's a good thing.  Looking forward to see what they add to the game.  There's plenty of food in the forest so if you want to avoid players	 you can live in the dense wooded areas.  Some people make the game about getting ""geared up"" and finding guns so they can kill other players but	 on my journey	 i barely ran into other players and have survived for very long periods without even having a gun.  if you have melee or boxing skills	 the puppets shouldn't be a problem.  I enjoy the game for sure and am looking forward to the future.  very good first impression for me."

I can only see a positive future for this game.Before i list my reasons	 please note that this is an early access	 and you are going to experience issues	 but the point is that by buying the game	 you are showing that you want this game to progress	 and you are supporting that process.+If you are into graphics	 this will satisfy.+In Depth UI (and will only get better with time)+1PP and 3PP	 with original tactics of balancing the two+EXTREMELY active development+Relatively smooth overall gameplay (will talk about this later)-Map is too big for transportation by foot only. (They will add transportation eventually.)-Other players are fairly laggy (again	 give it time)-Mechs are buggy and overpowered (being fixed as well)-only good loot is at bunkers/POI's (they are working on this as well lol)so pretty much... there is nothing bad about this game that they won't eventually fix.

It has done a ton of work and receives frequent updates and thats with the devs listening to players and trying to make everyone happy.  The game is not for everyone and definetly has a unique group.  It is kind of like dayz except it works and its got a good bit more to keep up with and I think will be very different in the end as well.  Overall its a great game with great developers and if u see people complain just remember that not everyone loves this sort of hyper-realistic type of game that these amazing developers have done a great job on.

Realistic nutrition	 character stats are meaningful from creation options	 crafting	 hunting mechanics	 combat mechanics that are really well done	 military bases are patrolled by Mechs to control RNG campers	 nice graphics	 so far very few bugs.

The zombies actually feel scary to be around	 the fear of going to a military camp or airfield is really there	 you genuinly need to be careful about your action	 even how much you sprint. It feels like a genuine fight for survival.People may complain about disconnecting from servers or finding it difficult to join them however its only launch day and to be honest i dont think the devs expected such a big responce towards their game.Also to note	 alot of people complain about the optimisation but its not actually that bad.

The map is very pretty and reasonable well balanced however the looting is ridiculously military heavy at military locations. I understand that it may not make sense for military spec gear to be just laying around in someone's home but I am not kidding when the /vast/ majority of somewhat decent gear is at military locations to the point where there is seemingly no point in looting elsewhere.There are looting phases are lengthy and travel between destinations is DayZ running simulator all over again	 however this time with confusing nutrition.I do not agree with their decision to make food/water so sparse	 especially when they are trying to promote player choice over what to eat. The menu system may as well be a straight copy from DayZ standalone with the crafting system incredibly difficult to understand. At this time I understand that I have a low number of hours and the game just recently released	 but I am looking at whether or not to buy the game for the product presented /now/.Finding servers to play on is bad	 put simply. They have a favorites tab	 but its worthless as you cant actually favorite servers. You can join off of IP	 but you cant see any of the server's IPs! There is no server search feature for servers.I would not recommend until they fix server performance	 menu UI	 and ingame performance. It looks like there is a /lot/ to fix and develop as the game progresses and the game has a lot of potential and that is what it should be viewed as	 a game to potentially buy at a later date."

No	 of course not. However	 you can tell the devs care very	 very much for this game. In the ~19 hours since release	 they've already put out two pretty solid patches to help with bugs	 performance	 and even adding a few things to the game.I love that I can go from survival	 to Battlefield-like objective shooting in just a few clicks if I get bored. And	 when I'm done	 I can go right back to the survival aspect and keep going	 or do more of those events. The concept is fantastic	 and can help keep two types of players satisfied.The map is beautiful	 the character design is great	 the AI threat is real as f**k and the stat/skill/metabolism system is just phenomenally done	 if not a little daunting at first. I've wanted a game for a while now that sort of combined EFT's hardcore realism with DayZ	 and this is pretty dang close.They've also added a tiny bit of The Hunter: Call of the Wild with the animal tracking system. Hunting is really fun and challenging	 and gives you a relaxing break from the rest of the game.The planned features (safe zones	 merchants to use your fame poitns (in game sort of currency earned with all of your actions)	 more guns and game modes	 fortifying buildings	 etc) will keep me playing this game for a long time to come.Would absolutely recommend this game if you like games like DayZ and Miscreated and	 to a certain extent	 Escape from Tarkov. If you're not into those	 you probably won't like this one	 either."

There are plenty of good reviews on the game. This review states the problems with it. If you have played Dayz then you have played this	 Until they add more to the game I would not recommend it.What the current version boils down to is Loot -> Die by a mech or by a person. The gun play would be my biggest complaint by far	 It just doesn't seem satisfying	 The controls are weird and seem robotic like and the way the guns work feel like the engine is not supposed to be used for medium to long range combat. The fighting does not feel satisfying or realistic	 Not sure how they would change the gunplay but the biggest thing in the game is combat and it just doest not feel good shooting guns. Rendering is another issue	 People and objects tend to blur then disappear completely from just a little ways away. I turned depth of field off and this is not what causes it. The calorie tracker and all the different vitamins and minerals are undermined by the fact that you do not really play long enough for it to effect you unless you're just eating salt. Until they add the safe zones and the traders like they say they are going to I do not see anything that stands out in this game currently to buy it for. The game gets stale quick. Other than the fact DayZ devs take a long time to update their game	 Dayz did it better. Who knows though	 If they update this game enough it could find its niche."

It will just take time since it just came out.i think this game have alot of potensial to come with fun fights alot of eating and pooping as you do in daley bases but what if you poop in a fire fight or if a zombie is after you ;) think about that alot of twists can happen under game. regardless i play this game att  medium settings and it looks still great 9.5/10 gama play still alot to fix but its good 7/10 is this game fun you ask i can give 10/10 but play with a friend will be more fun	"

Overall I can say the game looks and plays real smooth already. I play on medium settings with my ryzen 1200 (OC'ed) and gtx 1050ti but it looks pretty good on these settings. I think the game delivers on its promises so far	 whether you like them or not. There's a few things I have run into which I would like to share:1. Certain character creation skills are not unlocked yet. Dexterity only has one at the moment	 which resulted in me having 4 points left in dexterity which I couldn't spend. The locked skills include vehicle skills. At the moment vehicles are not included in the game yet (they have been promised by the devs)	 so I understand why they're still locked. Still	 something to keep in mind when building your character. Also things like gender	 skin tone	 crime and a few other character details are still locked. I assume these will be added to the game in the coming months.2. Item creation is confusing at first. For instance	 I had all the materials I needed for a wooden club (a wooden plank and an axe)	 however the craft button was disabled. After a bunch of messing around in my inventory to see what caused the disabling of the crafting I gave up and moved on. Later when adding nails to a baseball bat to create a baseball bat with nails (very convenient name indeed) I figured out both the nails and the bat had to be outside of my inventory. In hindsight this makes sense but nothing in the game notified me of this.3. There is no character creation saves. When I tried joining a multiplayer server I had to create a completely new character	 I couldn't use the same one from my singleplayer game. After I had finished creating this new character I tried joining the server. 'Connection failed'. Great. No problem	 let me just join a different server... Well... I had to create another new character. After that I gave up joining a multiplayer server. I might give it a go later	 but PLEASE GIVE US CHARACTER SAVE SLOTS	 ty.I only ran into a few glitches	 such as shadows of trees projecting on water really far away	 or my character's legs glitching through the ground when prone. Nothing gamebreaking. I'm looking forward to the future updates! I will keep updating this review	 but I can definitely recommend this game if you're into this genre.EDIT: after having run into them several times	 I think the robots are too overpowered. One robot saw me when I was crouched on top of a structure several stories tall. It proceeded to kill me with 2 shots while I was prone on that same structure."

If you wanted higher than 30	 you commited a thought crime. Eat dirt.The only reason you shouldn't buy right now is because of features. As of current	 this is just a ""Day-Z before it got fixed"" clone. There isn't anything to do. You just loot	 run around	 grind level	 and fight. That's all. And normally I do a good job of finding reasons to recommend games. For some reason they just added a lot of mechanics and gave us a play-test. Not anything to be mad about for most	 but if you expect a game that is actually a game	 this is not that. This is a working functions test in its current state. There is no progression	 there is no story	 there is no longevity. I've grinded since I downloaded and have hit a real dissatisfying wall: I have full gear and a gun	 with focus on surviving but  nothing to survive for  which is really aggravating. Puppet spawns are long and drawn out	 there is no base/barricading	 there is only war. Not fun unless you get money for sitting around doing it."

I DO NOT recommend even considering buying this game in the current state as you will be running for an hour until you get to a small area of buildings	 find a few items	 realise that you just wasted an hour running to accomplish nothing.If you're playing with friends	 as I did	 you'll spend the majority of the time running towards eachother and likely die doing so.Recommendations for developers:- Add vehicles	 immediately	 this would dramatically reduce the time it takes to get from point A to B and give more to do.- Increase the density of structures	 add more buildings	 this would help to give players more to do	 thus they spend less time mind-numbingly running.- Make it so people can spawn in with their friends immediately; a lot of people are going to play with others and by letting them band together quicker and easier it provides more time spent actually playing the game instead of just running towards eachother.Will this game get better? Probably	 if the developers choose to add content	 which many of us understand is becoming a rarer occurrence amoungst alpha/ beta games.Should you buy it right now? Probably not unless you're willing to wait a few months so that the developers have time to flesh it out.Edit: To all the people criticising my review	 I understand	 you enjoy this game in its current state and you acknowledge that it will improve in time. I acknowledge it will get better in time	 as a result of feedback. Developers need feedback from the userbase to understand where to take the game	 otherwise you end up with games such as H1Z1 and DayZ which faded into a much smaller community with very niche preferences for games.Let me repeat this	 the purpose of a review is 1. To tell people what the game feels like from my perspective. And 2. To tell the developers what to add to cater towards a wider audience.I respect the developers for the work they are doing	 however	 from my perspective (and I shouldn't have to even say that since it's a damn review) this rushed open alpha release with very little content shouldn't have been made as it provides a lot of negative PR for those who	 unlike me	 won't come back to the game in a year or few months to see if it's improved."

The first thing you will notice is the game is stunning	 i run a 1070 and have most things on high and get between 30-50 fps. i never notice it dropping but there are micro stutters but thats an bug.The loot is good and if you have prayed games like Dayz then you will get the looting right away. The combat very clean and easy to get on with	 the only downside i have seen is with there new style third person view where unless you have direct line of site they will vanish	 this would be great if it didnt do this evey time they walk by a tree as it looks like they lag or teleport 3 feet which makes it very hard to shoot them. I also dont like that if you kill a guy in a quad	 as long as he has has the fame point he can spawn with in 30m of his team mate	 I think it would be better if they had to wait 5mins to spawn there as combat gets interesting.Overall this games is 100% worth the £15! see you in game."

This game is what DayZ has trying to be during its entire development. I played this game on a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 gaming laptop with 16G's of Ram an Intel i5 7th gen core processor followed up by a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 and it runs incredibly smooth on high settings. However the game is choppy at times running 30FPS in large open areas. Most players DO NOT KOS. But be cautious around some. Hunger and thirst no longer kills but impairs you. Your stamina takes a blow as well as your energy but this is not life threatening unless left too long. (and i mean like	 20+ hours irl) the game at this point is lacking content but i have much faith in these dev's. Servers are reltivley full but spawning in the northern area's it may take awhile to run across another player. Gun play is superb. Not so much customization but realistic kick and loading animations. Nothing else too really talk about	 crafting system is just another crafting system and as of right now there is no base building. Zombie's are fast and do not overwhelm you 1on1 but firing your gun can attract a ton of zombies which may get you trapped and eventually killed. Zombies spawn everywhere but the larger cities and airfields house the most zombies	 making looting not so boring as you cannot run from house to house without making sure there are no zombies around the corner. BUY IT NOW."

You can play for for maybe half an hour before memory leaks cause freezing. Your PC will freeze up too once you exit the game meaning you have to either restart it or leave it for 10 mins before it’s becomes usable again. Played 12 hours of the game the only two times I’ve died were from freezing at the wrong time. It’s completely ruined what is other wise a decent and detailed survival game. Wait until memory leaks are fixed before buying if you only have 8 GB of RAM.

Instead of just a ""I'm full or hungry meter"" You have this really cool in-depth stat sheet of your caloric intake and actually wants your character to eat a balanced diet. Exploring bunkers and points of interest feel extremely tense with the zombies actually feeling like a threat and also the Robots from Robocop that patrol the area and will gun you down if it catches you which makes sneaking around bases and bunkers that much more butt clenching of an experience. I do have faith in studio and publisher of this game and the missions and end game that are supposed to come out sound amazing and it'll be awesome to see where this game goes. Try it out	 it's loads of fun."

The core gameplay is brillant imo	 and if they've got that at launch then Im sold. Many people have and will have server issues but again the game launched yesterday and there was a large fanbase for this game which means that everyone is joining a server at once. I don't feel like a game derserves a negative review purely beacuse the servers where a bit unstable on LAUNCH DAY. Yes	 the mouse wheel is used to run but ONE CONTROL that I fits with the games mechanics	 doesn't really mean the game is bad. To conclude	 people need to look at what there getting which is a lot for a VERY EARLY ACSESS GAME. Servers issues can be fixed and they are being fixed.  If you have the money and are looking for a survival game I really do suggest SCUM."

Something to think about for the dev's: With this great metabolism system that you guys developed + this great map	 I think	 this game would shine more as a pure nature survival simulation involving gathering	 crafting	 hunting	 seasons etc... Maybe an extra game mode(dlc) in the future. Kudos guys	 way to go!"

First impression is a big ol ""wow	 thats fantastic that someone is putting out this level of quality and depth in a game""! The other initial response was to feel a bit bummed that as I attempted to play via my controller (rather than keyboard)	 the only action available at this time is forward and backward movement. The dynamics and realism of this game is stunning though in a way that I feel totally emersed in the environment (with the rather cumbersome exception of learning the actions on the fly as a zombie beats me into a pulp). The other trouble lies in the recurring notification that my character is perpetually hungry despite the mushrooms and corn that im consuming. Im really looking forward to getting back into this game as the developers work out the kinks and getting up to more than eating shrooms and corn."

For being such an early state of the game	 the developers have made quite a stable build. However	 as with any game in early access	 there are flaws	 one being the combat system. Maybe I just suck	 but I always seem to have trouble with the zombies	 where most of my swings with melee goes right through the target and doesn't inflict any damage. I also use the ""dodge left/right"" during each swing of an attack	 and that doesn't seem to help. But like I said	 I could just be terrible at the combat part. As far as gameplay	 it's smooth	 enjoyable	 and entertaining. I can't wait to see what comes later on down the road with more crafting and surviving abilities."

513710	2	0	76561198140633259	15	2	-1	67.0	September 8	 201	"Despite being in pre-alpha/early-access	 too many issues exist to recommend at this time. A clear emphasis has been placed on character mechanics	 particularly metabolism	 at a cost of gameplay and purpose. Even metabolic functions	 which have been developed quite well in every other accord	 get exhausting when forced to defecate five times per in-game day and constantly be concerned about food intake. If survival is supposed to be emphasized	 it lacks any engaging allure as a sustainable system can be obtained within an hour of gameplay. There are so few crafting objectives in game to consider it a major element	 and PvP is obviously not supposed to be a core focus. With that stated	 what little PvP does exist has a well-balanced risk v reward	 yet comes with substantial issues. At this point	 PvP provides the only incentive to continue playing SCUM	 making server selection of upmost importance. A majority of players time will be spent searching for scarce weapons and even more infrequent ammo	 making an acquisition of a well-hidden stash of acquired loot necessary before successfully engaging in PvP. As an opinion	 this element of gameplay is well developed. Problems emerge when players perpetually leave your server until empty	 with no signs of re-vitalization. Once a server empties	 all items and acquired loot become pointless as no potential exists for PvP	 survival is not challenging enough to be engaging	 and there is no-where near enough crafting to keep a player busy. Also	 because a player cannot bring loot	 character stats	 or shelter equipment between servers	 restarting from scratch is the only way to re-institute PvP back into game. Many bugs and glitches exist	 but developers are actively addressing issues that arise. Major concerns for this game moving forward centralize around a lack of content	 purpose	 or reward system to keep players immersed. A fame point system exists which is well executed	 but unsubstantial enough to be a player’s only reward. Since pre-alpha launch	 development has proceeded with metabolic balance	 in many respects making it more difficult to manage. If this game proceeds to emphasize a need to acquire food and frequent defecation	 without providing more content or overall direction	 players will likely become disengaged shortly after purchase	 and no community will prosper. Developers suggest plans to assimilate primary and secondary missions	 as well as improve crafting and introduce elements to improve a player-friendly environment (such as safe zones)	 which if followed through would indescribably improve gameplay. Although several other agonizing aspects exist	 such as tremendous difficulty traveling any reasonable distance	 it remains difficult to suggest that these are negative dynamics to a survival-based game. Nonetheless	 improvements can be made on travel	 which are also presumably in development. Such an incomplete game at launch raises concern that reputation and community will squander before playability emerges from development. For this reason	 releasing such an incomplete product	 even at pre-alpha	 appears irresponsible. However	 because of an excellent foundation to SCUM	 it remains easy to forecast several future scenarios that could change this games course from a crap emphasis	 to an addiction worthy of a twelve-step program. For reasons mentioned above	 this game deserves a neutral rating. What negative dynamics exist can be easily improved in time. However disappointing it may be to receive such an incomplete product	 more hope exists now that this game will become a staple in my library for years to scum."

I don't have this problem with any other game I own	 from early access titles to the latest AAA games	 so it's not a matter of hardware or driver updates. It also takes forever to load.I like the survival aspects of the game	 but the game's systems are overly complicated and there is no tutorial. I've found myself having to tab out of the game just to find out how to light a fire which is needed to feed your ridiculously ravenous character. If you want to make a fire	 and you don't have a backpack	 you'll need to carry one log at a time and one stone at a time. It takes four logs and eight stones to make a fire. And tinder which must be also crafted. And a way to light it. You'll have to search for each stone manually	 right clicking all over the ground and you have to get the right kind of stone. Once you actually build and light the fire	 yYou can make a skewer to roast your meat on	 but the skewer disappears after you eat	 so you have to make a new one	 requiring getting another stick which means you have to find the right kind of bush to cut down	 and then you'll have to craft the actual skewer	 and roast the food. I think it took about half an in game game just to make the fire	 light it	 and eat one skewer. It's just so needlyly grindy.The buildings in the game are all cut and paste. If you've seen one town	 you've seen them all. I do like the inventory system and the clothing layering system. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sound effects. The guns are really crisp and satisfying.  The controls are clumsy as all hell though. After many hours of playing I'm still not entirely sure why it sometimes locks me into first person view	 which then requires reaching all of the way across the kjeyboard toi hit enter in order to take you back to third person. During a fight with multiple zombie running at you	 it's easy to die because of this. Every time you log in	 you need to set up your quick select. The game won't remember it. The zombies are great	 but if you kill one zombie near another one	 even with a silent throwing weapon	 the other will know	 and run to exactly where you are even if it couldn't possibly see you.This game just has a long way to go before it's anywhere near enjoyable. I hope the developer continues to improve it	 as I think it really has potential	 but this is as about as rough of an early access as they come	 so at this time	 I really wouldn't recommend a purchase."

Your hunger or thirst will not be instantly sated	 it takes time and for hunger	 it is also required you are eating more calories than you are burning in order for you to start regaining energy. The game is not as broken as some people seem to think it is at the moment it is simply more in-depth than they expected.Personally	 I have had a brilliant experience so far and I'm sure most others will too if they put in the time to learn the mechanics before giving up on the game."

When I saw the trailer	 and the introduction of new system like the wetness and drying system	 I was skeptical at best. However	 I was suprised when I played the game for the first time	 the hunger system is quite revolutionary for a survival game at this time and the third person mechanics made combat signifcantly more enjoyable.

Atleast for me.My Specs:I7 4790kgeforce 980gtx16 gigs of ramand im NOT running it from an SSDThe result are 60-80 fps on default settings with hickups and stuttering as things get rendered in. To get 120+ i had to tone it down to 720p and turn almost everything off/low. That smoothed it out but it didnt help the fact that aiming down sights still felt terrible. The low FOV didnt help that feeling either and ofc the game looked like i forgot my glasses. Trying to identify items on the ground = mission impossible.My Recommendations to the developers:Intigrate a ""hold"" option for aiming down sights. (i would personally also like to see a transition rather then instant pop in.)Intigrate a FOV sliders for ADS and Firstperson in general.Optimize performance LIKE CRAZY.Especially the last part here doesnt sounds particularly flashy on a update news page. But who cares about 3 new backpacks when playing feels aweful.As it stands the game is just unenjoyble for me. The ADS (aim down sights) and Framerate beeing the MAIN reason why.So if you have a beastly computer that can handle it. And you don't mind toggle aim down sights with low FOV. Give it a shot. Otherwise i cannot recommend the game in it's current state."

If you like this too	 i can recommend this game for you.I hope for the future of this game	 that it will be possible to just do survival and enjoy the games beauty and realism like in single player. I personally dont need to ""kill"" other players to have fun. The only thing that mocks me right now in its current state is that you cannot use some simple rope to craft your animal skin jacket and pants because it would just be a bit rough but not impossible if you need to survive and who would be so dumb in real life to freeze to death instead of start thinking for yourself and work for yourself instead of stealing or search hours for a 10 of 10 condition of yarn because you cant join this iten. But please always remember this is early access.Here is something different and somewaht off topic and please remember like evering else i write down: my personal opinion. I did read the news about this game about Nazi tattoos and i  think people shouldnt get mad about games in which there are some symbols or something. this never really represents anyones personal opinions. For example you could get mad because the programmers said: ""we are not even germans"". because someone could get offended by thinking: all germans are evil	 or even Nazis. (By the way: i am german and not offended). Please Population of the world: start reading more	 learn and think for yourselves and become more than you are right now	 we should be more than the parts we are made of. Come on guys watch the videos of the game programmers that explaines the game	 read the game manuals that are explaining a lot of the setting and story of the game. I think the game is made well especially for early access and i want to end this review whith the words of colonel Kurtz from the movie Apocalypse Now: ""You have all the right to kill me	 but you have no right to judge me""thanks for reading"

I had crafted a torch and had a lighter in my inventory and I still couldn't light the torch	 with no tips anywhere I just gave up. Don't bother fighting the zombies they all attend LA fitness or a local gym and are extremely ripped with black belt level hand to hand combat	 and move pretty well for decaying corpses. Also have fun finding ammo after finding your first gun	 hopefully they make a DLC called common sense and have a few ammo laying by weapons.

There are tons of bugs like zombies clipping through walls	 but it is the second day that the game has been out. So many tiny things implemented in the game make this game so fun. It's like they took the best systems from all survival games and put it into this one. The gunplay is decent enough and there is even a combat system for melee in the game. There are so many things and skills that you can learn. The game even has crafting. The only thing I want them to add in is base building or something like that. Having clans or bases  would make this game very fun. Overall I'd give the game a 9.5/10. I recommendplaying on singleplayer for a better and more immersive experience."

It is only just released as early access	 but the game is pretty stable and the gameplay is fun enough already. The graphics in the game are very nice. Great looking decorated map with good resolution textures everywhere and nice lighting and effects.The AI seems decent so far as well	 but I do have sometimes Zeds trying to grab me through walls. Their awareness and their persistance of chasing you feels balanced. It can be a challenge sometimes	 but it is possible to avoid them completely.I like the crafting system and the UI. There are quite a lot of things to craft already and it will be expanded a lot more when they add vehicles and base building and stuff. The crafting system is easy to use and doesn't feel cumbersome.The game is not very optimized yet it think	 because the RAM usage is really high and with a GTX970 I can only play the game on medium/low settings if I want 60+ fps. On Higher settings the fps dips all the way down to 20fps. They game still looks good on low settings though so it is not a big deal.Overall I think the game has a lot of potential and is currently already very playable. If you are into survival games then this game is defenitely worth a try."

This is one of those games that I bought on a whim	 then reached the gameplay potential far too quickly to really enjoy any depth to it. I wouldn't recommend you buy it in the current state. There is so much space to the map	 but so little to care about doing. This game reminds me of a hokey survival edition of something like MGS combined with Dead Rising - but with none of the fun items or great gunplay. The items are bland and the gunplay/melee combat is choppy and unreliable. aiming and going ADS just seem to be sloppy for the current build. Melee fights with zombies just devolve into strafing ballet. The giant robots are pretty cool	 and are about the hardest thing that you'll have to deal with in the game. There's only one type though	 and it gives you a russian accented warning to get out of the area before it starts shooting at you. Robots usually patrol the loot heavy zones and are easy to navigate around when you learn their patrol route. The coolest aprt about this game is the biometrics/hardcore survival screen which will be super cool to survival fans when accurately functioning. This screen has everything	 even down to the vitamins you're deficient on. For the same reason	 it can take away from the fun when the readouts aren't accurate. The biggest improvement I'd like to see would be more to do in the wilderness. The game has HUGE swaths of forest areas where one could get lost without the map	 but there isn't much to use in these vast areas. I can construct a shelter which is this tiny	 itty bitty structure with a slanted roof that you'd have to be crouched to get under. Oh	 and you can make a big box to hold your excess stuff which won't have much use either	 just seems more of a trash collector. After a few hours	 I wound up scrounging a shotgun	 ak47	 ak74su	 SVD and some grenades. After that I built the shelter	 box	 stone camp fire and just kind of sat around at the end of some rail road tracks cooking zombie meat. That's basically your end game	 sitting around a box of loot while cooking meat on a campfire."

Paraphrasing my friend: ""If Arma 3	 Escape from Tarkov	 and ARK (minus the dinosaurs) had an orgy that resulted in a baby	 this would be the result."" I'll be completely honest in saying that there's not a ton to do just yet other than survive	 loot	 and kill zombies/other players. On the flipside	 the depth of those aspects actually provides _a lot_ of content! To survive	 you'll need to keep track of every aspect of your avatar's metabolism: what kind of foods you're eating	 how much you're eating vs how much energy you're expending	 making sure your stomach doesn't get full	 and most importantly: defecating at the right times. I haven't noticed a huge impact from the enironment just yet (weather	 wetness	 etc.)	 but you'll also need to make sure your avatar is maintaining a good body tempurature. To loot	 you'll need to constantly maintain your valuable inventory spaces and track the weight of each of the items you're picking up. Gone are the days of Skyrim	 where you can carry 300 pounds of iron and run up a mountain like some Olympic god. If you're carrying too much stuff	 and your avatar is out of shape	 you'll be forced to stop and throw up about 30 feet up that mountain	 losing all of the invaluble food you've eaten. To kill	 you'll first need to find weapons	 with varying degrees of effetiveness. You can hurtle just about anything in the game at your enemies	 but it will help if the end is sharp. Guns follow an in-depth ballistic model (that I haven't yet had the pleasure of getting frustrated with).I think they've hit the nail on the head with this survival sim	 and I can't wait to see where they go with further features and improvements."

The amount of potential this game has IMO is very exciting	 it's already on par with or better than the originators who are still ""alpha"". (Slam)   This is the game we have been waiting for!"

Half the towns don't even have loot and you'll spend your first 20 minutes unsuccessfully scrounging for anything to craft your first item.Couldn't find loot within the first 20 minutes?

If you are a fan of hardcore open world survival games this is worth a try for only $20.  When playing an alpha game you have to look past the bugs and issues and decide if the core game is something worth sticking around for and of all the alpha games I have purchased (A LOT) this one is at the top of my list of worth it.   I look forward to what scum will become in the future.For an Alpha game i give this a 7.5/10."
513710	1	0	freakylt	95	14	1	23.0	September 3	 201	"TL;DRScum is now one of the most enjoyable survival games I have ever played and it's only in early access. The potential the game has is phenomenal and my only hopes for the game is that it continues in the direction it is headed.Please ignore any negative reviews made by someone with less than 2 hours	 because to be honest	 they have barely touched the surface of this game and how in-depth the gameplay really is.Now for the detailed review.Optimisation:For an early access title	 the game is very well optimised. I stick at around about 70-100 FPS	 and at times can reach over 100 with a 1070 GPU. Bearing in mind	 the world map is huge	 with plenty of dense vegetation and forestry areas and multiple major towns.The game runs incredibly smooth which is promising to see. However	 with that said	 the game at launch faced some memory leak issues	 but was quickly resolved by logging out and then back in. But	 with 12.3 hours played (at the time of writing this) I have not had to do that. So my guess is they have either found a temporary fix or resolved it completely.Mechanics:I think what sets this game apart from other survival games	 is the simulator-like mechanics. You have a metabolism tab that opens up a f*** load of nutritional information and stats. You have things like your vitamins	 calorie intake and outtake	 how many teeth you have	 sugars	 proteins and more. At first	 the depth to this and how it is represented in the UI	 can be overwhelming. But believe it or not	 it is fairly easy to manage the important aspects of your metabolism so don't be worried.Animations:Again	 for an early access title	 you would expect to see janky animations when running	 vaulting and so on. This is not the case whatsoever with Scum. The running animations are fluid	 jumping is responsive	 and vaulting is better than PUBG and Battlefield 1 (surprisingly). Something that caught my eye	 which is not too common with video games	 is the way your character reacts to its surroundings. For example	 I built a storage box	 stood next to it	 and my character put one foot on top of the box. Little things like this really show off how much detail the devs have put into this game.You really cannot fault their animations. Shooting:Shooting is not bad yet not great either. It still has some work to do	 especially if you want to make the PvP appealing to everyone. The TTK is very short I noticed. My first encounter with other players went down strangely. I had a .22 hunting rifle and managed to one shot a dude in his chest. I was fairly surprised to have dropped him that quick. So maybe increasing TTK might make engagements more enjoyable and challenging. In terms of hit registration and hit boxes	 I haven't experienced any of those issues yet	 but I am sure some other players have. Only time will tell as I come across more players.Crafting:Not only is the nutrition in game very detailed and in-depth	 but so is the crafting. It is very realistic yet simple and intuitive at the same time. Cutting down a tree will leave you logs and small/large sticks. These sticks can be bundled together and you can carry them in your hand. Similar with logs	 you can cut them down further into planks and bundle them together	 then carry with your hand.A nice tough to the inventory system is the way you drag things out. You can physically drag an item and place it in any specific location in your surrounding area. You can also craft things within your vicinity instead of placing them in your inventory first.In addition	 cooking is really well done. You can make a small skewer that takes 3 pieces of meat. To cook it	 you click the skewer	 then click the fire and select cook. It then runs the cooking time/animation and you are good to go. Again	 so many detailed little touches that make the game great.AI:The AI in this game are awesome. The zombies (known as puppets in game) aren't stupid and physically react when you get in a certain distance. The attack animations are bog standard but not buggy. Hit detection can suffer a bit when both you and the zombie swing at each other. Other than that it is a great laugh trying to kill a zombie with your axe.The sentry robots (not sure what the correct name is) are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but offer so much more to the game. If it wasn't for the patrolling mechs	 the game would be a bore with just zombies. The mechs offer a completely new dynamic to how you approach the airport	 bunkers or guarded outposts. They are somewhat OP at times	 with the spot system being way to quick	 and the shots being way too accurate. However	 the latest update since reviewing this has changed them again	 and made them somewhat easier to circumnavigate. It is hilarious seeing your friend aggro the mech and get shot at numerous times. A welcomed addition to the game.Overall Gameplay:At the end of the day	 it is a survival game	 so whether you spawn in fresh or die	 expect to do some running. I've seen a few reviews stating this game as a walking simulator. Guess what	 it's a survival simulator	 what else did you expect.To be perfectly honest	 there are enough towns	 buildings	 outposts and more to accommodate your trips. I don't see myself walking/running for more than 10 minutes before I see action. As mentioned previously	 the game runs very smooth and when you have a beautiful looking game that runs well	 it makes for a much more enjoyable experience. Final conclusion:This game is amazing. I love every minute playing with my friend. We have had so many laughs with its poop mechanics	 and karate kicking each other in the face until one gets knocked down. I highly recommend getting this game. Yes	 it started rough	 with bad server issues and so on	 but the devs have made great improvements and continue to do so.From what I understand about this team	 is that they are fairly young and small	 so to be able to make a game this well in early access	 you couldn't congratulate them more."

What counts as ""Camouflage?"" Does stealth count into it? What does Survival do? How do the weapon and melee skills aeffect the character? Second note i want to add to this is it just takes too damn long to rank up said skills. At medium	 to level up say	 running	 you would have to run nearly TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT	 in real time	 if the rate of leveling keeps going at 1 tick / second spent running	 just to reach 1	000	000 running experience.The map feels way too sparse as it is. Everything just feels like it's a half a hour run away in comparison to other survival games	 (obvious point at dayz here.) where towns are in variable distances. Not to mention your character	 regardless of the endurance stat	 ends up being an asthmatic that gets exhausted roughly after a minute straight run. The metabolism tab is very cluttered	 and once again	 lacks direct information with what half of the different things even do. Most of it i learned by trial and error. And Google.The melee combat is probably the most innovative ive seen. Rather than being a blind swingfest	 having a somewhat of a soft lock system for the thing is nice	 while still giving you proper control of your characters movements	 making it easy to dodge a crazy person's swings. Blocking however	 feels useless as you drain stamina faster than you can say ""♥♥♥♥""	 so just out maneuvering is always the better option.Loot has a nice balance to it	 while being purely rng on searching the closet for clothes or if you have to mike tyson a crazy person just to steal his. But i feel that the military bunkers are just way too easy at the current. There is literally -nothing- stopping you from sneaking into one of these places	 running through it and coming out with an AKM	 acog	 bullet proof west	 a helmet	 ammo for days and some scraps of food you've discovered. The mechs literally protect nothing (unless you happen to get dirahea and have to stop in front of one because your character decides the time to go is NOW as you're being gunned down by some massive millimeter rounds.)Then..the multiplayer. About 66% of the servers stuck at ping 999	 do not work. The ones that do work	 do not show a very good environment unless you're playing on a low population server. Why? Who knows	 some people say it's because they're locked at  5 ticks	 maybe the multiplayer just isnt as polished.TLDR? If you can spend the while waiting for the game to get refined	 because the devs certainly are active	 then go ahead	 buy it and give it a try. Otherwise i'd skip this one for now	 just keep an eye on it."

There are plenty of bugs and lots of jank to be had (the devs have already released a couple of patches to fix various issues)	 but the game that's here has a very solid base and a lot of interesting ideas.Those ideas are what set it apart from DayZ. SCUM has very unique and in-depth character customization and metabolism mechanics	 not seen in the survival genre. The character customization allows players to allocate stat points to do things like increase the amount of items a character can craft or how stealthy or perceptive they are. If a character has more points in stealth	 it will be more difficult for other players to spot them. If the character has a high awareness score	 they can spot others more easily.SCUM also addresses the third person ""cheesing"" often discussed amongst survival game fans. If you're behind a wall	 and there's another character on the other side of the wall	 the game will not render the other character unless yours actually has line of sight with his eyes. This also involves awareness and stealth checks	 as previously mentioned.The metabolism system	 while seeming incredibly daunting at first with its various charts	 graphs	 and scores	 doesn't necessarily need to be engaged with in a deep way unless you really want to get the best performance out of a character. Generally	 just making sure your character is fed and hydrated is enough. The developers have stated on past streams that they want it to be a system that players can engage with as much or as little as they'd like	 and I think that it's almost there.In addition to the customization and metabolism	 SCUM offers event modes to break up the sometimes monotonous bits of survival. For 10 Fame Points (which are accrued through crafting and killing)	 inmates can enter event modes and drop into a no stakes	 traditional deathmatch or objective mode with a chance to earn even more fame.However	 SCUM isn't without its problems. 60FPS can be a bit tough to achieve (I had to lower my render resolution to 60)	 and the netcode has been less than stellar. That sort of thing is to be expected in an Early Access game in its first week though. The developers also seem to be keen to be communicative and active in finding and fixing issues. That's a huge plus.So	 SCUM seems to have a lot to offer	 even in an early and janky state. However	 I think there's a strong base here	 and I think it could become the survival game that players have wanted since DayZ first entered development all those years ago. If you can deal with the jank	 by all means pick it up. However	 if you don't have patience for the imperfections	 maybe wait for a couple of patches."

I loved the metabolism mechanic (although it's not as essential as the game first makes it out to be	 so don't be put off by its complexity)	 I loved the combination of zombies	 mech's and PvP	 I loved the look of the world and was overall very impressed with the game. However	 the game is not without its faults and the main one was server lag. Trying to PvP (especially hand to hand or melee) was nearly impossible due to players lagging all over the place. The lack of a tutorial	 even a basic one	 seems crazy with how much effort has went into the game so far (thank you to all the Youtubers for the tutorials). The size of the map is impressive but also unnecessary due to a max server pop of 64. The large map coupled with the lack of places to visit turns the game into a bit of a running simulator at times. There are many other small issues but these are matched	 if not outnumbered by the other little things the game just get right.In the week since the release of the game there have been so many updates (read the patch notes) and the developers have obviously been listening to their player base as the patches have been aimed at fixing the issues players faced with lag	 performance and hackers being the main ones.

Yes.. it has issues	 yes the PvP isn't great right now.. but it's coming along.

I've played this game probably too much the last couple of days and im enjoying it. Looted a few military bases and got pretty geared but not sure what to do next. PVP is kinda unenjoyable at the moment due to desync	 but hey	 its been in EA for only a few days. I'm sure they're working on that as we speak. So far the devs seem to be on the ball and frequently reading the reddit post.-Graphics are great	 optimization is not so great. On my i5 1060 12GB i get about 50fps on medium	 but drop heavily while rendering cities. I know thats not a super powerful rig	 but still. -Metabolism system feels fresh and keeps you on your toes.-""Puppet"" (zombie) AI is a little annoying but i guess zombiez IRL would be prettty annoying too-Inventory system is great in some aspects and awful in others. Obviously inspired by Tarkov but not executed very cleanly	 chest management is quite a frusterating chore for a gamer with OCD.-Gunplay feels a bit arcade-y but still nice-Loot is well balanced	 somewhere between Miscreated and pubg lol. Feels realistic.  Police stations are a good place to find weapons and light armor in early game.-Military bases are a scary and pretty intense areas. high risk high reward.Well this review ended up being way longer that I expected so I'm going to stop now or else ill just keep goingTL;DR -Game is fun	 I like it. Not a whole lot of things to do quite yet but a great Survival game. Refreshing if you like the genre and a good game to get into if your new to the genre. If PVP will make or break it for you	 wait until it gets better."

If this game has piqued your interest	 learn the basics first	 like where the loot is	 how its various systems work	 and what you can expect from the gameplay. I've enjoyed it so far even with its hiccups	 which are to be expected from an early release which dropped days ago. PvP moments are intense and dodging mechs is exciting in SCUM. I've played some solo and with groups and probably enjoy playing with a group more but for either player type that enjoys survival games	 it's worth checking out."

And this game is the closest thing i've had and enjoyed in a long while. I like A LOT and can see so much room for potential	 and i hope that it reaches that potential. BOTTOM LINE: I have paid a lot more for a lot less game. $20 of fun can easily be had in this game	 try it out."

If you squad with a friend you can see each others names in close quarters so PvP inside a building isn't as messy. But from distance you can't see squadmates name so communication is needed.+3rd person doesn't have advantage over 1st person in PvP+Collect fame points from kills	 surviving	 doing much of anything	 for perks like spawning in a certain sector	 spawning on a teammate	 spawnning randomly.Cons:-BUG: Desync in PVP makes servers above 30+ people hard to PVP on. This is the biggest of issue right now. once this is fixed (I'm confident it will be very soon) the PvP will make this game much more enjoyable.-Stamina amounts need tweaking (as expected in day 3 of an alpha)	 you can't sprint for very long regardless of the body type you make of your charcter.-Health % can take a very very long time to regenerate if you don't have a proper diet and a healthy character. Proper nutirion can be hard to sustain if you are PvPing in airfield for long amounts of time-Leveling skills take a very very very long time.-Not many attachments for guns-No auto-run key yet-Can't swap items easily in inventory.Overall: When desync issue is fixed this game will be even more amazing than it already is. PvP is fun when not laggy	 surviving with mates is always a good time. Screaming and running away from mechs can get you goin' as well.Cheers	 Survivors."

Pay the $20 trust me it's still good but with all this support when the game goes out of early access it will easily be one of the best. 7/10 so far but i can easily see this game to be a 9.5/10

The events you can queue up for	 man	 what an awesome system. People need to queue for those more often because they are fun	 you don't lose your gear and it's a great way to get accustomed to the gun play and the TTK (Time to kill). Pros: 1. Excellent developer team	 responsive and they care. This is their baby. 2. Very immersive world	 so many things are searchable. 3. Gun play is really good. 4. While the health tracker	 vitamins	 minerals	 etc. may seem confusing at first	 once you understand it	 even at a novice level	 you really start to appreciate the detail they put into tracking how the body works. 5. Gear looks great	 even lower end gear. 6. Sound design is really nice	 as well as the weather and day/night cycles. 7. The fact you can toss rocks and smoke grenades to distract zombies getting in between you and looting is great. Cons (Neutral	 considering it's in EA	 will update later on down the road to be full cons):1. The servers seem a bit sketchy at times	 optimization should fix this hopefully. 2. I'm not sure if I'm the biggest fan of the system they have in for preventing 3rd person peaking.3. Cars need to be put in the game as soon as possible	 simply because the map is huge. 4. The map is so huge	 with the current player cap things can get a bit lonely	 though if you want to see people there are plenty of hot spot looting locations to do just that. I.E. airfield	 random scattered bases	 the dam.5. Crafting tends to be a bit confusing	 perhaps some streamlining or some sort of tutorial at the beginning would help this. 6. I'm not a big fan of the depth of field blurring	 I realize this can be turned off through files but there really should just be an option for it. Things I hope they add in/tweak: 1. Another type of mech	 see Black Mirror's episode titled ""Metalhead""	 those robot ""watch dogs"" would be great additions and add in a terrifying threat	 especially if they tracked you. 2. Loot variance	 balancing. Official servers are quite barren. 3. Maxing out stealth should make your footsteps quieter and doors open softer.4. Add in the ability to breach doors	 gently crack them open	 just more options for stealth and entering buildings. 5. At least allow friends to spawn in the same sector as you	 this will get better with vehicles	 etc. A big thanks to the dev team of SCUM	 it's clear that this is your baby and I hope that you all continue to work just as hard as you have to continue making SCUM a truly fleshed out	 survival experience. Should you buy this game? Absolutely	 -IF- you can handle the bugs and trials of playing an early access title	 or see hope in this dev team. Twenty dollars and you get an experience that took DayZ almost 6 years to even scratch	 with even more survival features	 better gun play	 intuitive AI. If you can't deal with the trials and tribulations that come with an EA title	 probably not."

It's not overly well optimised	 but my 970 and i5 can pull 30-40 fps	 the combat is clean	 the survival elements are gripping enough to keep you interested. There are more features than dayz standalone had for a LONG time after early access release. So far	 I am impressed. I am looking forward to play it again tomorrow with some friends. Looking at some of the other negative reviews	 I honestly couldn't disagree more with what people are saying about it's not even ready for early access. They need to learn what early access is. You knew what features were and were not in the game before buying as streamers and youtubers have covered the game extremely well prior to release. They didn't allow pre-ordering either so you can't even complain that you didn't know what you were buying. Really gamers are extremely toxic towards their own system	 it's self destructive. I really cant beleive anyone can complain about such minor bugs or missing features (which I dont think there are many	 it's actually feature rich for an early access game)	 and at this price? Damn you lot are a needy bunch of entitled ♥♥♥♥s. It's an excellent early access game for the price. I wonder if a lot of negative reviews are complaining about random♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the real reason they are complaining is because they have bad systems or don't know how to configure graphics settings for the machine that they have? Looking on steam hardware charts	 many steam users dont even have a 2GB GPU let alone a 970	 1080 or whatever. less than 1% of steam users have a top spec OC i7 8 series with a 1080ti combination	 but everyone in this review section seems to have that configuration... get real. You udnerestimated how much umph your machine needed	 and now you are salty your gtx 550 can't get 160fps like fortnite so leave a bad review for such minor reasons. As an Arma 2 dayz mod (pre epoch) player	 this game is the FIRST survival game to give me that feeling again. All the others that have come	 gone	 stuck around	 turned into utter bags of♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the first that has shown to be a cut above the rest.

The crafting is awesome	 the looting is great	 you can find everything you need if you pay a bit of attention.My first run: spawned somewhere in the middle of the map. Quickly crafted a rock knife	 then wood spears	 killed a zombie and crafted a backpack. Happy dayz. Then I was ready to explore. I headed North because I wanted to see the lake and get on high ground. Found a military base	 actually a prison	 on the way. It was like a completely separate mission. I sneaked around and got myself a handgun	 some ammo for it and two cool rifles. And of course some camo clothing. Without being too greedy	 I left the prison and continued my way North	 climbing mountains	 crossing streams... man	 the scenery and level design is amazing. Crossed the big dam at the lake	 stopped by small houses	 shot some zombies	 the usual. Ended up being able to craft my own ammo	 food is plenty	 even got some vitamins. Slowly I made my way all the way North and stumbled on a hidden military settlement. This is where it got bad. Somehow one of the huge robots saw me and swiftly shot me. With 2% health I managed to limp away and hide	 just to die a moment later. Luckily I had over 100 points so I just respawned in the sector and after a quick hike	 I got all my stuff back. This is where I am right now. Had to log out to take a break and wait for daylight. For sure there's something cool hidden in that settlement.TLDR: this game is so much fun. It's everything Dayz should/could have been. Everything just feels as it should be. Doesn't feel like a running sim	 it's not too difficult yet it's challenging enough.Also	 on day one	 I had zero crashes	 zero server issues	 and no lagging. These devs are amazing!"

You will most likely fall to your death.-Wish you could exit your inventory when you eat something	 if you do it now. It cancels what you eat. -128 player servers. -Less fame points lost when you die/suicide. -Spawn closer to your friends. And how the **** do i use cigarettes? I have only played 2.6 hours and i love it. It is just smalls things like this that i feel can make the game much more fun and playable."

Killed by falling - obvious	 and most interestingly died from drowning	 Swam out for miles and as nearing the shore my health started to drop	 I presume from not being able to breath underwater	 surprising that because as your swimming you can't rise to the surface	 you simply swim along the bottom of the body of water with no way to actually get to the surface to breath?.You then die and all the stuff you've struggled to find simply disappears	 you can revive sure	 but at a random location on the map if you cant afford to spawn near your death	 and its so hard to actually get any points in order to revive near your gear.So can I recommend this game in its current state? no not really	 wait for a few more months till its gets a bit more polished and the kinks ironed out.Note to the devs	 keep going	 don't let it fall by the wayside and I will change to recommending the game.Further additional experience with the game has proved yes its flawed but it has potential.Even in a survival situation with the world going to pot as in the game	 there would still be things to find	 your wandering around villages and towns that the inhabitants it seems have taken everything not too bulky to carry which includes nails and tape	 yet when you come across zombies they only have the clothes on their backs?. So trying to find ANYTHING is hard to	 Wheredafack is everything	 did the aliens take it all?Why is it so hard to find anything practical but you can find paper	 rubber bands and magnifying glasses	 where they particularly choosy when they evacuated? No dear leave the gaffa tape and rubber bands	 take your hot pants	 who needs food when you have your football jersey to worry about..And as yet Scum has no purpose to it	 your basically running around trying to scabble out an existance trying to survive only for there to not really have one as yet	 so why bother	 its just a see how long you can survive game hence the survival format	 eventually you will die either from a zombie or a mech in the bunkers. And why is it ALL the zombies are male	 did the aliens take the women too?But to be honest if the devs put in as much effort into gameplay as they did for the animations of peeing and pooping then maybe there'd be more content	 I don't really want to see my guy go through the motions (quite literally) of pulling down his pants ( which he doesn't) then pinch off a loaf (with sound effects)	 and what you can find paper to craft with but you cant craft toilet paper or even use a sheet of A4 to wipe	 you have to use your hand? ewww.Talking of pooping getting past a mech to get into a bunker isnt all that difficult	 you just have to time it till it goes past then sprint to the door	 open it and hope the mechs aren't all that accurate	 sure they might get a lucky hit	 but sooner or later you'll be kneedeep in military hardware	 uniforms and guns ( but very few bullets)	 saying that I did have lots of bullets on me only to suffer from hyperthermia and not able to really do anything as I couldn't take my clothes off for some reason	 must be a glitch...As i said potential	 keep going. Oh and devs? how about rather than dropping gear when putting something else in your hands such as food how about storing the said item	 if it drops on the floor its got a good chance to disappear especially if your stood next to something."

It has alot to explore already	 but still room for alot more to come.The developers are throwing out patches	 updates and fixes every few days. They respond fast to issues that the community attends them with on their Discord channel. Their effort and work is outstanding. Of course the idea and some visuals remind of certain other survival shooters which were the pioneers	 but that´s part of the genre I guess. Buy it as long as it´s so cheap	 under 17€ is a joke	 it´s worth way more.As I said	 a longer review might come once I get to play a couple hours more."

I don't understand why that is a negative.  IMO	 this is an open world survival game and that is how it should feel.  I shouldn't be running into other players every 5 minutes.  I am out here to survive.  Encounters with other players should be stressful in nature.  Their intentions unknown.  It adds to immersion and hopefully leads to better roleplay and use of push to talk rather than kill on sight.  Granted	 some players KoS because that is how they want to survive.  So be it.  Any how	 hunting is fun.  The puppets (zombies) aren't too challenging but can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when in groups of 5 or more.  Fire a weapon at one and you attract all of them within a pretty good radius.  There is still some work to be done on the complex systems that you have to monitor.  Loss of energy doesn't really seem to have that great of a negative impact.  Eat here and there	 have a drink a water and you won't die.  This is early access so I expect things to become more complicated as development continues. So far I am loving this game.  Very well optimized.  Looks amazing and runs smooth as butter.  Plus	 creeping through the woods at night amidst the growls of wildlife and puppets is intense.  I am definitely in this one for the long haul.  I hope that it lives up to its potential.  It could easily become one of the best survival games on the market.  Buy it now why it is only $20."

Unfortunately I can't play it that often due to school	 but I highly recommend you invest into the game. Just $20	 a lot cheaper than most other survival games and you get much more out of it	 because for a game in Early Access	 it has quite a lot of content. It's only going to get better	 because with Devolver's track record they're going to make sure the game is complete	 it's just that with a game as complicated as this they're going to require feedback. I'm sure that within a year the servers will be fixed	 and a year after that the game's going to feel completely different.

I was looking forward to SCUM.This is Early Access	 so performance will most likely be improved upon greatly later on	 but for now	 this is how the game runs on my system. Just getting this out of the way for those that care about it.CPU: Ryzen 5 - 1600X 4ghzGPU: AMD RX 580 8GBRAM: Corsair Ballistix Sport 16GB (2x8)Maximum settings 1080p: 34 fps.Minimum settings 1080p: 38 fps.The game is a 100% clone of DayZ	 even the map seems familiar in some ways.Is this a bad thing? Not at all	 I enjoyed DayZ. But somehow	 it's worse than DayZ.When you start the game	 you'll find no loot	 why? Because as you run around	 you'll notice that all the doors are opened. This means that other players have already run across this part of the map and looted everything	 you're essentially just running around picking up scraps that no one else wanted. When you do find a player	 it's basically luck that determines who wins the fight.Players are teleporting around	 and even if you do manage to get a hit in with a weapon	 nothing happens. I joined a server with 24 ping	 but it feelt more like 4000~5000. Constant disconnects as well	 again	 early access. But this is how it is at the moment.I just can't recommend this	 you'd be better off spending your money on the DayZ Standalone as that game is more polished.I do have faith that SCUM will become a game worth the money	 in a year or two	 and if that happens I will change my review."

Our nerves were on edge. We were lucky to come upon a small town and a farm house with a patch of watermelons near by. We feasted on succulent watermelons right there in the field thinking we made it	 that we will be okay. Little did we know... Explosive diarrhea ensued and we were starving again. We needed more food to survive. Then we saw them	 two friends not unlike us mere an hour ago: hopeful and eager to explore this unforgiving world. We waited and stalked them as hunger became unbearable. The line between the right and the wrong got blurry. They split up	 which sealed the fate of one of them. He didn’t even see or hear it coming. The moment he stopped to check his bearings	 I stood up	 drew the hand back and released the metal spear with the deadly precision. His body fell in a heap of unmoving flesh as the spear finished its quick journey. Upon closer look we saw he didn’t even had a chance to change from his prison orange pants. We ate in silence by the fire. Fed	 warm	 but not whole. Some part of us has been left behind. In the woods south of town in District B2."

There is so much potential for this game that if the devs keep working on it then its going to b a good gameI run a gtx 960 2gb with a i5 4690k @4.0ghz and i get good fps on medium settings without any lag spikes."

There is next to no content	 currently the only thing you can do is spend 10 minutes running to a popular location and looting 20 boxes to get geared up. Then spending the next hour trying to find someone. Your next option is to either die immediately due to lag or from one of the various glitches	 or you can hide like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and play by yourself. This game blows. 100% reccomend not playing it for at least 6 months. Not sure if the price will increase so I bought it now cheap at $20 but this game feels like it has tons of potential	 it's deffinetly better than dayz and some other survival games. The framwork is there	 it just needs the filling."

With 12GB you get a lot of freeze at cities.​With 16GB you're saved.​With that said this is a great game with a promising future	 but I personally don't recommend you to play until those memory leaks get fixed	 you'll see how frustrating is to get 2 guys in front of you in a city and screen freeze for 3 secs because RAM is full and you're using SWAP memoryTL;DR - This game cannot run on 8GB Rigs and if it's able it will run poorly	 consider this before buying the game."

The map is quiet beautiful and large enough (144km²)to host 60-100 players. I see the idea behind the robots guarding the military outposts and the high end loot	 but for now the best and efficent thing to do is to rush into a military base	 have a little patience	 ""outplay"" the robots and have the best loot you can get in around 15 minutes.No crafting	 no searching for loot for hours and no PVE needed. Which is a bad thing	 because that's what a lot of people do for now.Graphics and performance are quite OK. On a I5 4670K@4	5GHz	 16GB RAM and GTX1080 I get around 50-60 FPS at 2560x1440 and around 45-55FPS on 3440x1440. I have a lot of problems with desyncs	 especially in PVP too. I was fighting against two people for around 10 minutes because we couldn't hit each other	 because the characters were jumping from one to another place all the time. In the end we just gave up and I ran away	 which wasn't a good experience at all.The game has quite a few surprising moments though. It has a lot of details which you have never seen in any other game before. The crafting system has a nice depth to it and will be ( hopefully) even deeper in the future. I had a moment with a friend when I randomly throwed stuff around	 to show the effects of the sliding when an objects hit the ground and he said ""hey there's a sign	 throw it against it"". And we both were pretty suprised that the hammer bounced of that sign	 created an realistic sound effect and a few sparks. Immersion is one of the best selling points of this game i would say!Also I was sitting at a campfire with a friend and we were crafting a bunch of stuff	 killed a boar and were roasting the meat	 which just felt very good and immersive too.Also there are lot of reports of cheaters right now. If there won't be a good anit cheat	 this game will be destroyed by it fairly quickly! The roadmap for the future developement of the game is also not very specific and pretty roughly formulated which is alarming i would say but we will see.All in all I can't recommend this game at this point	 not even at this very low price point. I have an eye on the developement though and update the review if necessary.EDIT 3rd of September : The game has EAC Anit cheat now. @Iggy : 21:9 is not yet fixed.	 desyncs are not yet fixed and loot/rushing for military bases is not yet fixed and none of these points where fixed in a patch yet. Its EA right now	 I know that	 but i I feel like if these points are not fixed I can't recommend this game to anyone.I will patiently wait for fixes/changes and edit my review in that case!EDIT 4th of September : 21:9 support is there. Thanks!"

Typical Early release issues (broken textures/animations	 random crashes	 random teleporting	 loot going missing or loot reorganising in your inventory randomly)	 except for defecation etc. the game concept is nothing new but has a lot of potential.  After my first review they have now fixed the Ultrawide issues and seem to be listening to the community	 which is great news	 and hopefully they iron out the bugs in animations and movement soon. This game has a lot of great potential and if the devs keep listening to the community and keeping us active this could become an amazing game. To date this is one of the best games I have seen in respect to their lush landscapes and detail in the amazing view distances. The game also seems to be really well optimized (unlike PUBG) running on ultrawides everything on epic this game barely even gets my pc warm. Great to see an early release that doesn’t destroy gpu's or use unnecessary memory (again PUBG.. yep its still broken...)For now I wouldn’t recommend the game to anyone expecting a finished product or not willing to spend a lot of time waiting.. but if your an experienced gamer with a lot of patience for the issues that come with early release games then its worth a go."

DO NOT RECOMMEND.Previous Review------------------------------I've never played DayZ or H1Z1 so my first few hours in this ""work-alike"" were a major disappointment; walking	 eating	 defacating and smelling my fingers.  I couldn't adapt to the constant blurriness and pop-in of everything more than about 80 yards away	 the FOV was way too tight and there was no option to modify either.  All night visuals look washed out and hazy.  I came real close to uninstalling.Then I went digging around for INI modifications to fix my visual woes. Disable Depth of Field? Check.  Increase FOV?  Check. With that out of the way I gave it another try.... and found the actual gameplay loop.  It's not crafting	 it's scavenging!  There's no reason to craft anything more than a stone knife and makeshift spears	 at least not that I've found. With some spear practice you'll be headshotting zombies in no time.  Even a nice baseball bat can work wonders with the right stick-and-move tactics.My biggest remaining complaint is the barely-adequate sound effects and their completely off surround sound implementation.   The rear satellites do not produce expected ambient sounds such as wind	 rain	 thunder	 zombie groans	 or gunfire	 but for some reason rivers do and sound fake as hell.  Thunder and water sounds are canned garbage. Lightning sounds do not even remotely tie in with proper thunder timings based on proximity. Sound volumes for near and far sources are all mixed up and make your ears positionally lie to you constantly. I really hope they fix this because it breaks immersion and screws with your senses.Anyway	 totally worth 20 bucks once you get past the finger-sniffing hump."
513710	0	0	TheSmurfNooneLikes	85	1	1	35.2	September 1	 201	"8/10 Survival aspects are extremely well done	 although the building system needs more work. Gun play is usually pretty good	 occasional desync every now and then but its bareable. Server population needs to be more dense	 finding players is extremely uncommon. Zombies need tuning	 currently they can go through certain walls (sometimes)	 will hit you consecutively with no chance of hitting back	 and can pin you in corners or on a ladder for a mech to come and kill you. Speaking of Mechs they should be tuned down to where they have to see your entire body before they warn/shoot you. Currently if an already aggro'd Mech spots you then you will probably be aimbotted no matter the distance. Overall	 excluding the minor bugs	 its a great release and I hope for the game to be improved in the future. For its current price Its worth it. If you cant stand tiny bugs in a game	 dislike the survival genre	 too lazy to learn a crafting system	 or just an overall crybaby	 then this game will not be for you.

Will consume a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of your approximate 20k days of living just to get geared up and meet with your buddy. Do not expect this game to be very good because of the stage of development it is in right now but you will have a good experience as you learn new things (unexpected things happen all the time in this game good	 bad	 and straight up annoying) and come across new ways to play	 strategize	 and execute different scenarios/situations. Many ways to play this game. The crafting menu is a great feature. Check out their roadmap	 these guys are hard at work in making this game better every week. The amount of detail/depth they put into the crafting and metabolism/health systems are astounding for a game that isn't even in beta yet. BUT	 yes I will say the pvp is absolutely horrendous lol. THE PVP IS BEARABLE	 but surely could be improved. I domed 4 guys teamed in a town (one guy two times) but they kept spawning on each other so they ended up killing me	 which I found completely ♥♥♥♥ing broken and the spawn on squadmate feature definitely needs to be removed/tweaked. OVERALL	Decent for a game Pre Alpha/Alpha."

513710	2	1	76561198011358609	430	17	-1	2.7	September 9	 201	Honestly the game is mostly hype. The loot is VERY scarce and the charactar designer is kind of a joke as you can choose between 5 preset faces and you can ONLY be male at the current time. I refunded after 3 hours because of various bugs and the game (as I said) being VERY overhyped.On the upside the game looks ok (not groundbreaking) at the highest settings.I would say wait on picking this up for at least 6-8 months for more content to be in the game.

At first I didnt like it because I went about it all wrong. The graphics are great and gameplay is generally smooth	 the sound is phenomenal and one of the main aspects of the game. I have been running around with a friend for many hours and their are moments that my heart has almost jumped from my chest.1.Hearing gunshots in the distance near a camp you just made and knoiwing the realism behind gunplay as it simulates gun mechanics in real life and your stats play a factor in spread and holding your breath. Do you fight? hide for ambush? or move to another location to keep your fame points?2. Getting charged by a bear which knocks me out and my mate shooting it in the head on point of impact. I thought I was dead but to my surprise I stood up after a short period of time. Skinned the bear and made a helmet out of the head and gloves from its paws.3.Seeing a player with no gear walking towards me while i had my stone spear drawn	 he knelt as though to submit but as he walked closer I threw the spear 20m and it landed between the centre of his eyes	 I could not stop laughing.4.Accidently firing my AK while runnig to a town which set off about 5 zombies	 ran to a house and found some axes so started throwing them through windows headshotting them and enjoying myself immensly.5. Met some french guy after throwing a spear at him	 joined groups and did some exploring	 met another player who started to hang with us	 ran into the forest to decide were to go next	 next thing the new guy pops us both in the head and most likely took all our gear. A game of trust?Just a few examples of crazy things that have happened and this is just a base game. They have many more things coming and losts of issues to fix but as an alpha I have to say this is one of the smoothest and intricate experiences I have ever had in a game. Just be patient and realise it is about staying alive and not getting into gun fights	 maintaining a healthy metabolism (I love the complexity as I have a reasonable knowledge of nutrtion and physiology) and building fame points (this most likely with have more purpose with new mechanics)If your not ADHD this game may be for you."

There are a few issues that as with all early access titles might put you off completely from this game. Wait for it to beome the gem the publisher want it to be.1. The default control system is alright	 but not very user friendly. The new Experimental update of Dayz has much better weapon controls. They should replace the Aiming and Targeting with a better realistic option.2.1. Performace - Most of the low end gamers would not be able to play the game due to performace issues. I've noticed that the inventory and graphics system seems to be interlinked very	very badly. I.E. When seeing a player from a distance everything seems smooth	 but when a player suddenly runs into the same room as you the graphics system tries to render the newly arrived player only upon ""seeing"" him. This will cause stuttering on the pc that had the other player secondly in view putting them at a significant disadvantage.2.2. Framerate drops when a lot of players are in the same area. It seems similar to the issue above where the rendering system cant keep up with the player inventory database. It does not keep track of nearby players and reloads thier graphics to match thier inventory quite frequently.2.3. Stuttering when entering towns/bases. This happens due to loot bien loaded in client side. The game does not seem to keep track of look dynamiccaly	 but rather load it in as you access the the grid. This caused me to die more than once.3. Graphics - Are everybody Near Sighted???!!!. The Game has sniper scopes and acogs	 but they are not very usefull beyond 200 - 300M because of the Blur Effect. This should be addressed ASAP. In real life as this tries to be you can see much futher. LOD textures are just plainly BAD. Far off terrain looks like the background rendering of Dukenukem 3D (Yes the old One.) It seems as if the programmers are trying to reduce lag by cutting rendering distance. 4. The Map is very generic. There arent a lot of identifying features which makes for visual stimulating locations in the game. (This also ties in with the View Distance.) In other games you get the odd disernable building/road/city. Her it feels very generic. I suspect this will also be addressed with a map facelift soon.5. Yes BASIC basebuilding. Not true basebuilding yet but the developers prommised. I hope they can keep a reasonable base size limit and not allow base that spans entire continents. I hope that they allow you to build your base whereever you want and not restict you in any way. This is what would happen in reality as well.6. No vehicles yet. I asume this will only be added when network optimization is fixed.Even with all these issues the game looks promising and I fully enjoyed the experience so far. Buy it	 Dont buy it. Just dont expect too much."

Some people might find it boring or lack of content but if you complain about it then don't buy a game in early access.

While i'm sure there are areas for you to actually find loot	 it seems to me like this game is going to be a long slog of trial/error runs with your character. I starved on my first attempt. Respawned in starving again... Yea... i'm good. There's plenty of other games where you're not just looting sneakers and rags and random bits of scrap metal. I searched like 4 villages	 and i think maybe the best loot I found was a backpack. I don't expect to come out of a farming village looking like Rambo. But I feel liek you should be able to find usuable	 sustaining items	 on a somewhat consistent basis. And i'm not seeing that here."

513710	1	0	76561197965067948	196	67	1	16.0	September 11	 201	"SCUM combines strangely deep survival elements with a massive	 gorgeous map and some neat looter shooter elements tied in.It can be great going out alone	 but is often less nervewracking when squadding up.  The real fun comes from finding an outpost guarded by the patrolling mechs and doing all you can to slip them while you accrue the most gear possible without catching a mech bullet to the dome (they’re pretty deadly).Yes you can pee and poo and drink booze and eat mushrooms until you’re falling over and throwing up	 but the meat and potatoes here isn’t the realistic turd physics. It’s the incredible amount of little things that keep you busy without you knowing it.  There’s a lot of little fun time wasters that suck you in here.The gunplay is great and really shines in deathmatch modes. If you desync and you and your enemy exchange bullets slow enough that you both die (this will happen to you at least three times each deathmatch session) you won’t get too triggered because the rewards for winning and the punishments for dying aren’t very severe in either direction.Which brings me to the fame system. This is the one thing that needs to really be rethought in my opinion. If you die you can spend fame to respawn at your base	 on your teammates	 or randomly in a sector or randomly accross the whole map.  It costs wayyyy too much to respawn at your base in my opinion. People assaulting someone’s base shouldn’t be able to camp your spawn area for two or three kills until you run out of fame so that they can stay and loot.  It should be easier for the defenders to hold their ground	 but alas this is an open world survival game so I understand the reason that the devs may encourage base takeovers.Definitely worth a try for 20 bucks. Give it a shot and I garauntee you’ll come out with some goofy stories. Oh	 and a heads up for newbies	 deathmatch modes can spawn in certain areas of the map. If you see one starting and recognize a dome forming around you	 HIDE OR RUN AWAY. I gunned down some poor soul who was just trying to leave the deathmatch area today. Wrong place	 wrong time. Guess I really am SCUM.7/10 - Already a fun time waster and definitely has the potential to keep growing and getting better."

A option to make a party with friends so you can se where they at on the map will be a good feature to .

If the devs keep it up I can see this game going a long ways.  I played Dayz and breaking point (Arma 3 mod) and I have to say I like this the best out of both of those game.  The loot is very easy to get you wont be mad if you die to the BS aim bot robots haha. To be honest people should play this game more yes there are bug but come on its a early access game if you buy a game to play with 0 bugs you don't play PC games very much or ever.

When I play on my ultrawide at 2560x1080 my fov is so low I absolutely can't play	 and there is no fov slider. It's so annoying that I almost refunded the game but instead opted to play by running the game in 1920x1080 with black bars on the sides. Once I did that... the game is pretty decent. It's like dayz with better graphics	 and more in depth. Maybe a little easier to learn than dayz as well	 though crafting could be made easier. I haven't quite figured that out yet. One thing I really like about this game over other survival games is they give you the ability to play team deathmatch	 or deathmatch modes by earning points in the survival game mode. Then they also have rewards you can earn by playing those modes. It's an excellent idea. Game still has a ways to go but so far I think it has the potential to be a great game. It's already less buggy than dayz so there is that. Hopefully they will add a fov slider soon though. So far I'm giving it a thumbs up. I wouldn't recommend buying yet if you can't handle early access because it's a bit buggy & isn't very polished yet. We'll see how the devs do with updating & improving it. So far it's not bad. Not the best game I every played	 but not terrible either. Tons of potential. I'll update my review later as the game updates.UPDATE: I'm in love with this game. 22 hours in	 and I am enjoying it more all the time. Once you learn some of the hotspots you will  find that you can die and it doesn't bother you that much as you can get some decent gear fairly quickly. The game has so much depth to it. There are just so many things they have done well. The more you learn the better the game gets.. It has some major desync issues right now and still needs a good amount of optimization but after following some tips online on fixing my fps I have been able to get my frames up high enough to eliminate a lot of the desync. Now that I can play without everyone teleporting everywhere the game is extremely enjoyable. I love this game. I can't wait until it gets optimized and gets more content. I'd like to see more zombies on pvp maps	 and perhaps base building at some point but even as is... the game is really fun	 and it's only gonna get better from here so I'm stoked.Update: 37 hours in.. They have come out with two updates. The first one fixed the 21:9 issue so now I can play on 2560x1080 proper.. Second update has greatly helped the server desync lag issue. Love that the devs are updating so quickly. The game is amazing. Hands down my favorite game already.."

Broken launches	 slow updates	 and out-of-touch devs can and will kill a game from the get-go. After being let down by DayZ many years ago	 I didn't get excited about or touch any early access open-world survival game ever again...until this one. And the best word to describe my first two days playing SCUM is ""Wow!""The game played great from the moment I opened the client for the first time. The world is massive	 the scenery is beautiful	 the animations are fluid. Melee combat against mobs actually works	 and it works great. Guns feel amazingly satisfying to shoot. If this is how great the game can be in the first days of early access	 I can't wait for the future. PROS:-Huge map	 tons of points of interest-Visually very pleasing-Throwing/melee/shooting feels good-Event mode (get teleported to a location	 play an event	 get teleported back to original spot at the end) is cool	 though it would be cool to have cross-server events or higher incentives to play them-Crafting system is intricate	 and there are plans for much more expansion-Biometrics system is pretty neat --- intimidating at first	 interesting once you get used to it-You can poop and pee on peopleCONS (as of 8.31.2018	 since some on this list are already being worked on)-Server desync and player teleportation (being worked on)-Memory leak takes frames down pretty quickly (not unbearable though)-Crafting UI could use a streamlining	 making it easier to see what you have/what you need-Optimization (being worked on)Would totally recommend this game even in its current state. Loads of fun if you like the genre."

I spend a lot of my time raiding towns for supplies and looking for places to hide out and cook. I scavenge and look for opportunities to raid	 and I've mostly constructed my own narrative. I'm trying to fight my way through without resorting to cannabilism	 and trying to maintain good nutrition. Self imposed challenges make for an enjoyable experience on top of the ""a player might try and kill you"" aspect. Puppets are dangerous and encounters get frantic. It's not an ""action"" game	 but it has action. I haven't had much issue with the servers (a few times I've been unable to connect	 but otherwise very smooth for me). Game could be optimized better	 but after day one patch it's already shown so much improvement. For $20	 this game is an absolute steal. Devs should be proud they've mostly lived up to the hype. Now I hope they follow through	 but already it's a great game."

I want to say it's fair to buy and the game will be increased day per day. Now for the people who say that it simialr to ARK and DayZ DUDES is behind the same logic of gameplay . BTW  the devolopers will add vehicles in 1-3 weeks and farming system and more . They have 50 developers who they are working every day and up to 100 others who they have up to 15 years in developnig . BUY THE GAME WORTH

I've not crashed once due to anything else besides the leak.Beyond that the game is kind of a sad joke. You wanna laugh but you paid money to hear this aweful joke and so you smile anyways.Getting down to the meat...You will quickly find out that farming for loot in basic areas is the biggest waste of time and so you have to move into high quality areas. There are a lot of them but they all share one common annoying	 op	 dumb thing to be put into a survival game. Mechs! Mechs everywhere....forget pvp	 L2 mech dodge is the name of the game.If you ever want anything more than a basic pistol or rifle that takes you anywhere between 1-8 hours to farm up in the basic areas	 then your only choice is the high quality areas (with free mechs). UNLESS you catch a fully geared guy squatting down to take a )(#@*$ in the woods and cap him in the head from behind with your single shot pistol (cause the magazine can't seem to be found outside high quality zones)	 then once again your only choice is these mech filled areas.Ahh mechs...not so bad once you aggro them for the first time	 they ask you very nicely	 for you to GTFO	 but the next time even while they are faced away from you can do a 180 no scope head shot from 100 yards out and under a second flat	 no amount of sneaking	 taking cover behind a bush or twitch reflex will save you this day. Now some areas are not so bad	 easy to avoid	 easy high end loot....BUT	 the only threat so far has been mechs and hackers.Hackers?! Yes...the spawn on you kind that go through and wipe the entire server in under 5 minutes flat kinda hackers. They teleport in behind you or in front...doesn't really matter and insta dead. Almost like a teleporting mech.Moving onto the crafting system....Lame to say the least. You need so much to craft so little and even less space to hold all of the things needed. If you want to build a chest to stash some stuff in...too bad the chest doesn't open....no stash for you. The select item and right click other items in some sort of trial and error to see if you can get something to work or cut or anything is down right annoying. I had a can of food for a full day before I found out how to open the dam thing.Food! Food is a joke to find in this game...for once in a survival game everyone took all the food with them when they bailed out! I've never found a can of food myself in this game to date	 the only way I got a can of food is by some dip who charged a mech with a spear and he had it. I wanted to question the fool on where he found such a rare relic of the past world but dead bodies don't talk much. If you get this game and are in need of food. Zombies...kill them	 chop them up into little meat pies and go to town. Yes they were once human...but scum gotta eat. Cook first tho.COMBAT PvP! Have you ever wished for a teleporting	 sliding	 bouncing FPS?! Then buy this game	 you'll love it. If you want a game where you can line someone up in your cross hairs and hit them from 100 yards out? Unless they are AFK it's not gonna happen. Though I have watched a streamer do it from really far away but the bullet missed by an easy 50-75 feet and he still dropped dead. Don't get me wrong it was a solid hard laugh but more at the coding than the rag doll death.Over complex things....just cause. Eating...vitamins...minerals....okay	 but why? Shhh no one knows but green = good red = bad. Yes peeing and pooping is fun...not so much when you are sprinting to avoid a mech and your man stops dead in his tracks...DROPS HIS GUN AND GOES TO DROP THE KIDS OFF AT THE POOOOOOL! With colon volume at 12% (thats how much out of 0%-100% you have to poo). So word to the wise	 dump whatever you have in your colon before running kids	 it could save you from a mech...or zombie...I would say player but I've only ever seen 3 so far.Healing....ehPrepare!!!!To wait...a lot....and often if you want to get into combat. Any damage	 even if 1% out of 100% needs a rag or bandages to patch the wound and lets say you're 10% or lower when this happens. Jokes on you	 wait another 30-45min to heal to full or just die. First thing I did when I got this game was to think that I wanted to be an MMA king and just wtf punch people and zombies to death and not give AF if I died or not....well turns out 30 minutes between fights is a bit of a mind changer. I can't find anything rewarding about the system in place at the moment. You either get fully geared in 30min-1 hour at one of the high quality zones or spend hundreds of hours in basic areas	 there is no half way point. Deal with mechs or waste your time. Then once fully geared and ready to rumble	 try to find someone....anyone...maybe not...hmm	 says the server is full but I've not seen a soul in four hours. Five hours later!!! Hacker Jesus comes down to bring you to a better place.Overall this game is not worth	 not now and maybe not ever depending on how they handle the loot and combat.My main complaint in this game is this...The game's premise is ""Both fan favourites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers	 producers	 and corporate sponsors for fame	 gifts	 and a chance of life after death"". When the real premise to the game should be ""Both fan favourites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of one-shot goodness while battling mechs for the support of....zombies?""Where the *#$( did the zombies come from and why are you hiding all the awesome stuff behind a wall of mechs? Let us fight!I mean if we can find one another that is..."

There is barely enough items to get about 2 hours out of the game. Which is unfortunate because I would have returned it then. Now it has to sit in the pile of games that are unfinished and unplayable. With the rate at which all these games develope I will have a playable game within the next 5-10 years. But hey! if you like to tirelessly read updates logs just waiting for the perfect moment it's worth playing again this game is for you. If not I couldn't recommend it."

This game barrows a lot of the best things of a lot of the games I love	 it barrows from Tarkov by allowing you to use the Mouse Wheel to move faster and slower and there's only 3 stages of speeds and that different parts of your body can get hurt	 also working on realistic ballistics (adding wind	 air pressure	 penetration	 ect) and hopefully they will add a ton of guns and customization. It's comparable to Dayz for obvious reasons	 survival	 pvp	 lots of RP potential	 most of the game is how you encounter other people (talk	 negotiate	 team up	 kill	 rob	 ect.) By this logic I'd add it's comparable to The Hunter: Call Of The Wild	 because it adds the tracking vision holding Right Mouse Button	 if you shoot a animal or player they run off you push Right Mouse Button walk up to the tracks/blood trail it'll tell you which direction they are heading	 and how badly they are bleeding. Comparable to Arma in the respect of you can micro manage how low you wanna crouch with Ctrl+Mouse wheel	 While ADS you can Shift+Mouse Wheel to manage zeroing and Shift+Alt+Mouse wheel you can adjust windage personally	 I find those controls way better then in Arma (not hating Arma still love the game!) As you can see it barrows a lot of amazing systems from other games while creating its own unique game	 Oh! Also takes insperation from ark since you can poop! XD alright if you haven't caught on yet is joke	 it is it's own game and while it has similar aspects of a lot of games it's NOT any of those other games I'd boil it down to if you want a Dayz game that will be finished someday buy this even if you don't wanna game like that	 buy it it's only $20 and it's fun as hell and I'm really excited to see where it goes	 all these negitive reviews are people who can't comprehend a game that just released to the public	 is going to have server issues the first day/weeks. Also people who want to give it a negitive review because of a streamer they worship XD TDM	 DM are fun as hell and the survival aspect is just amazing with all the things you have to consider calories	 weight	 water	 vitamins (if your casual you can just get away with eating and drinking and not be effected terribly) Try it for yourself its only $20 XD. Its the Dayz That will be finished someday! :D"

Ive seached entire villages and only found useless junk. a single zombie takes 10 bullets to die and the worst part of it all the game tried so hard to look good that it cant even run itself	 when it rains you cant walk 2 steps without lagging so you spend half the game dieing because zombies swarm you as soon as you start lagging and thers nothing you can do about it.

Understanding what to store in inventory	 and when to use and what not use. How much to eat	 and when is too much. The Zombies are fast as hell though and avoiding them can be a task and risk but getting past that is cool as well. For survival game I would recommend this game to anyone in to this genre of games."

You lose your loot and you have to start all over again should the server ever go down. I remind to every single plausible investors of this particular project	 this game still IS in its buggy mess.One of the bugs that I find very much annoying is the despawning of crates that you make on Single Player mode. The other being the fact that some items aren't able to be crafted despite the fulfillment of required mats for said items. Some items require you to put everything out of your bags and craft them while the mats are on the ground	 very inconvenient and weird.Of all these bugs though	 I'm still bummed about the fact that you have to start ALL OVER again if ever the server you're in goes down. This game really needs an actual OFFICIAL server on every continent. From my experience	 EU servers are all over the server list.Again	 for future investors of this early access project; be wary	 have fun."

513710	1	0	76561197978824094	76	11	-1	36.5	September 2	 201	"So after following this from day one I was surprised to see the game was going to be posted on steam and figured they might be going the direction of paid early access	 further surprised it's launched now and they seemed to still be out of EA production by at least 6 months	 maybe even a year still	 but here it is. Lo and behold	 they needed another 6 months.  This is essentially Miscreated with better textures and a WAY overblown and distracting digestive system simulator.  I would have expected swimming to make more sense with how in depth they got about ""getting wet"" but your character will swim like a stone when you're carrying merely two spears and wearing your prison duds	 no indication of how long until you try to breathe like a fish and no way to tell if your head is above the surface in first or third person and also when you finally breach the surface like an inept dolphin in third person view	 you still can't see through the murky water.  I think the water should become completely transparent once your eyes are above water in TPV just like peeking corners works... OH and if you're running hot with hyperthermia	 water doesn't cool you down and you can't drink it without puking.  You'll just black out for 60s	 wake up	 puke for 180s	 then likely pass out again	 hp will drop	 starvation and dehydration will happen and you'll be stuck in one spot dying unable to move	 remove clothes	 eat	 drink or cool off in any way.  Cool system	 but really	 really	 REALLY broken.  Also	 it's another distraction from actually having fun in the game.Basically it has new and very in depth mechanics that really haven't been done before BUT they don't add to the game in the end	 they distract you and really kind of ruin it.  This trend of paid early access alone should have been indication number one that this would be the quality of their shaky start (Which a shaky start is understandable but not THIS bad). Why not free beta test?  Why are we paying YOU to help you discover these VERY obvious problems for you?Also	 the crafting system is REALLY clunky and almost useless	 when it becomes essential for survival it's going to highlight the distraction of their broken systems that much more.  You'll likely die to environment 75% more often than to players as it is and 95% when they implement needing to cook meat and boil water.Right	 they also launched without any sort of anti-cheat	 take that as you will.It seems like a great idea to make this super realistic but just like all of these types of games tend to be	 in a practical way	 it isn't a game anymore.  In implementation in spite of how bad you want it to be fun	 it is not. IF you think this game is almost great	 go buy Miscreated instead."

They released it far too early. Too many bugs. Including desync in multiplayer that makes combat rarely go well. You need to play such a big map with 64 players but when you try to you can't hit anybody as they keep teleporting due to desync. As the game is still bare bones there isn't enough to do to make up for it. This game has great promise but I think releasing it now was a mistake. Basic is ok but not basic and broken. Even when they get around to sorting out the issue people are going to be a bit over it.

I think the game has a lot of potential	 but at release	 not at all what I was expecting.I immediately bought the game on launch day plus the DLC	 only to find it’s a zombie	 crafting and survival game - not at all what I expected. I was hoping it would be more of a tactical survuval shooter. From the “next generation	 story driven survival game” part of the description and combination of the videos and screenshots	 that the game was going to be something like a PUBG hybrid with a story line and more in depth mechanics	 if I could say that and makes sense? I was totally not expecting a zombie survival game. To be fair... I didn't check the game out further as much as I usually do on YouTube.

That guy gotta be dropped on the ground head first way too often.The character customization is incredible	 you can be strong	 fat	 skinny	 fast	 intelligent and depending on how you want to be you get ""skill points"" that you can spend to learn skills to run faster	 have more stamina or whats probably coming later in the game improve driving and flying skills.There is nothing bad about this game	 as long as you know what it is before you get it.People complaining just said: ""Oh hey new survival game gotta try."" But you need to check things first	 watch trailer and explaination videos and you will know what you get into.For an EA title the game is great and a lot of fun.(And yes you have to run a lot	 that's what these type of games are about you c*nts)Only issue I got is that 8GB of RAM are not really enough to run it properly	 i mean it works	 but in high loot areas like the airfield you will notice laggs.But minimum requirements for an EA title is always a risk	 that's why I'm upgrading my RAM now to enjoy this even more.So ♥♥♥♥ the other reviews	 do not wait for full release and jump into it!(16€ is ♥♥♥♥ing cheap)"

I really like the climbing	 since it's not that common in survival games	 it can be used to get on roofs and maybe ambush someone or escape the puppets or maybe someone has hunkered down in a building and you could climb upstairs and go in through the balcony.This already feels like a better survival game than most	 the key word there being ""survival"". There are many little details concerning well... your survival. One of the biggest being the metabolism tab	 which shows basically everything you need to know about your character and more. I'm not sure how realistic the survival will be	 like will your character be able to survive three days without water	 etc. I played for five hours and when I logged off it was evening in game	 like ~9/10 pm	 so I'm still not too sure.

There are some buildables like a small makeshift shelter	 campfires	 food racks	 etc.When it comes to AI and well NPCs in general	 there are only a few. Some animals	 the puppets and the mech walkers. Most common would be the puppets (aka. zombie dudes)	 then animals. The mech walkers appear only in specific locations (like the dam) and they have a specific patrol route	 which is kinda their downfall (they can be avoided fairly easily once you know where they go next).Keep in mind that I have not tried the PvP yet and I can already say that is the main attraction in the game at this moment	 because the PvE features are either non-existant or unfinished. I've heard that there's supposed to be a goal of escaping the place by removing the implant in the back of your head	 can't say for sure though.I'd say gearing up isn't that hard since you can almost just run into a prison or something and gear up while the mechs either bug out and stare at a wall or walk around like idiots. Though if you don't go to one of these military grade locations	 you will have a harder time finding weapons as you might assume. Maybe you'll find a M9 or a Hunter 55 maybe even a Kar98 but you'll also need ammo	 which isn't that common to my experience.I really feel good about this game	 because it seems to be taking itself seriously. Plus finally a game has real survival mechanics	 or the very base of it anyway. I really hope they won't ♥♥♥♥ this one up somehow and I do hope they will start pushing out updates regularly. To me it seems that this game is a passion project which is always awesome to hear	 I did get the supporter pack as well which basically just gives a few cosmetic items but that's just a bonus.There are so many things I could talk about for hours and hours	 like how excited I am for the story of this game and all the challenges that it might start slowly adding. I am also confident that this game JUST MIGHT encourage against KOS (Kill On Sight). I would really love to see this game be the (May I say) first game to do that well	 but then again... haven't tried the PvP yet.A solid foundation for a complex and deep survival game.PS: If I did miss something or give misinformation	 please send me a message and I'll fix it."

I had such hope that this would be the next game I loved to play... It wasn't (for me). I think the game has a lot of potential	 but at release	 not at all what I was expecting.I immediately bought the game on launch day plus the DLC	 only to find it’s a zombie	 crafting and survival game - not at all what I expected. I was hoping it would be more of a tactical survuval shooter. From the “next generation	 story driven survival game” part of the description and combination of the videos and screenshots	 that the game was going to be something like a PUBG hybrid with a story line and more in depth mechanics	 if I could say that and makes sense? I was totally not expecting a zombie survival game. To be fair... I didn't check the game out further as much as I usually do on YouTube. I watched the videos on the Steam Store page and was sold by what I saw... I guess my infatuation with the game blinded me to the rest of what it actually is. Maybe I'll look into the game again down the line	 but for now	 this ain't for me."

That guy gotta be dropped on the ground head first way too often.The character customization is incredible	 you can be strong	 fat	 skinny	 fast	 intelligent and depending on how you want to be you get ""skill points"" that you can spend to learn skills to run faster	 have more stamina or whats probably coming later in the game improve driving and flying skills.There is nothing bad about this game	 as long as you know what it is before you get it.People complaining just said: ""Oh hey new survival game gotta try."" But you need to check things first	 watch trailer and explaination videos and you will know what you get into.For an EA title the game is great and a lot of fun.(And yes you have to run a lot	 that's what these type of games are about you c*nts)Only issue I got is that 8GB of RAM are not really enough to run it properly	 i mean it works	 but in high loot areas like the airfield you will notice laggs.But minimum requirements for an EA title is always a risk	 that's why I'm upgrading my RAM now to enjoy this even more.So ♥♥♥♥ the other reviews	 do not wait for full release and jump into it!(16€ is ♥♥♥♥ing cheap)"

I really like the climbing	 since it's not that common in survival games	 it can be used to get on roofs and maybe ambush someone or escape the puppets or maybe someone has hunkered down in a building and you could climb upstairs and go in through the balcony.This already feels like a better survival game than most	 the key word there being ""survival"". There are many little details concerning well... your survival. One of the biggest being the metabolism tab	 which shows basically everything you need to know about your character and more.

Basically DAYZ but 5x better. super optimized and although there isn't very much content as of right now im sure sticking through the early access portion of this games lifecycle will prove fruitful as the developers seem to care about the playerbase and what we want. Some small amount of DeSync issues. but presumeably that will be fixed soon enough. Gameplay-wise if you enjoy FPP/TPP survival hyper realistic games this is for you. I hope that with time this game will become one of the greatest survival games ever!!!

Combat can be buggy at times	 noticed how shotgun damage seems to be a bit glitched. But aside from that	 I would highly recommend this game."

The devs are currently updating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the game and staying on-top of everything making sure to try and help in ways they can. It honestly reminds me of the old DayZ days	 when me and my buds would go play on a server and chill/meetup to loot and kill other players/zombies. The only real things I dislike about the game is the map size	 food system	 & fame system/meeting up. MAP SIZE-I feel like the map is just wayy too huge currently for the playerbase. It kind of reminds me of playing the atlas map on Arma 3 with only 60 players on the server(you'll never spot anyone for miles). I think it's maybe just because of the ""earlyness"" of this game though	 as I have been spotting more players in areas where there's more loot nowadays	 since the game has been out longer. I really would like to see a smaller map put in for the future though	 maybe give us a choice to play on it or something. The more variety	 the better.FOOD SYSTEM-Currently	 the food system is alright in the game	 but fiber is just out of control and annoying. I would eat a couple of bites of a mushroom in game and my character would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with diahrea for the rest of his life. It's pretty insane that one mushroom can give you 1000+ percent fiber.FAME SYSTEM/MEETUP-The fame system just need tinkering all around IMO. You lose soo much fame when suiciding	 but the only real reason why you're having to suicide is so that you don't have to run for an hour+ just to get back to your teammate(big map size problem again). I think they should maybe make a ""less costing"" option to spawn atleast a 5-10min run away from your partner	 instead of making it cost fame to just keep suiciding to spawn on remotely close to them. A feature for spawning a 5-10min run away from them would be cool too	 like maybe 40-50 fame? Bottom line though	 I just feel like it's annoying meeting up currently	 maybe they'll put base spawning in the game in the future	 like a bed system in rust and it will be easier though. For now	 I dislike it and would say it's probably main reason I'd tell someone not to buy the game currently.If I had to give the game a rating currently	 I'd say it's a solid 7/10."

I think they plan to bring base building and vehicles to the game soon which will be nothing but an improvement. the game is a polished DayZ and Mistreated. The only thing that really needs fixing is the Dsync which i believe will be fixed soon enough. I can't wait to make a RolePlay server on this. Discord to my server that is currently in the making is https://discord.gg/M7AmXCM  The release date is yet to be confirmed but will be soon.

513710	1	0	wafflehousespecial	215	76	-1	7.5	September 1	 201	"First impressions of the game are not good.  The inventory system and character movement is a 1:1 carbon copy of DayZ	 and the crafting/looting is a 1:1 copy of 7 Days to Die.  They’re literally identical. I wouldn’t be surprised if some lawsuits arise of this.  Neither of those systems were very good	 and rather than coming up with something original they seem to have reused crappy systems from other games.  The loot table is spectacularly bad	 with the map being over 9	000	000km in diameter	 and like most other survival games	 99% empty and useless.  You walk mile after mile after mile	 eventually taking off your headphones as you tire of your characters loud obnoxious breathing noises.  Once you finally get to a town	 it’s just house after empty house	 with no guns	 no food	 nothing useful	 just bolts and wire and empty containers of gunpowder you can do nothing with.   In the trailers this game has zombies but I never saw a single one through multiple towns and day/night cycles.  I got bored extremely quickly with this sterile environment and opted to do what everyone else is doing- suicide repeatedly until you spawn close enough to the airfield.  So that’s what I did	 spawned and ran into the airfield.  Giant transformer bots roaming everywhere	 but they patrol predictable patterns and are easy to avoid.  Within 15 minutes I had about 6 guns	 full armor and helmet	 combat fatigues- the whole 9 yards.  In short	 I was geared out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥  The one problem?  No ammo.  Not one bullet	 shotgun shell	 or nothing. Just empty mags and uselessness.  Let me ask you; what is the point of having 6 guns on you and 0 bullets?  Answer: no point at all.   As a result	 while looting a container another player ran up in his prison uniform and punched me to death while I waved my shotgun in his face uselessly.  Game over. The character customization is bragged about being super extensive	 but in reality your appearance is entirely pigeon holed into four skins: 3 white guys and a black guy.  You can’t customize your face at all	 and your only options are tattoos 1 or tattoos 0.  You can make him fat or skinny: that’s it.  So much for standing out from the crowd.   The game doesn’t even connect to servers properly	 if you try to refresh the server list the game freezes for a solid minute and then the list remains empty.   Apparently it’s a known problem and the devs just decided to release it in this broken ramshackle state. They made an extensive post saying to go look up sever ips on a website	 then copy/paste into the game and use direct connect.  Seems a pretty shameful state of affairs to me	 but people will just say “early access you need to expect it to be♥♥♥♥♥♥”  Which I guess is true	 but I guess what my standards are for fixing things must just be higher than other peoples	 which is why this game gets thumbs down.  The redeemable qualities seem to be the extremely powerful unreal engine	 which boasts powerful graphics	 and the game seems to be optimized fairly well.  I’m getting about 60fps solid at max settings and a 2k resolution so that’s pretty good.  This game engine is tried and true and pretty easy to license if you have the money so there’s really not much to that. The game has an abysmal depth of field effect which once again the devs have made a long post about how to fix yourself rather than just fixing it.  The other redeemable thing about the game is that you can take a poop and wipe with your hand.  That’s about it. This game is more of the same	 more poorly executed unfinished placeholder garbage with a quick trip to boredom town and no real redeeming qualities.  It’s all been done before and this is just more of the same.  The only thing new this one brings to the table is the character customization which right now doesn’t exist	 as well as the ability to pee and poop	 which in my mind isn’t that groundbreaking."

You just wander around and find people to kill until someone kills you	 then you just search aimlessly again.The combat (especially melee)	 is also some of the worst combat you will ever find in a game. It's just spamming left click and the first person to get a hit perma stuns the other person with left click spam until their dead.I will	 however	 say that this game has potential to be something really cool. I will likely return in 18 months when it launches to give it another try. But I was looking for something to take up my time until late Oct when Red Dead 2 comes out....this wasn't it.

But that doesn't change the fact that the game has major flaws in it. My #1 issue with the game so far is the fact that even if you have room in your bags to store weapons in hand	 the game just won't allow that. I have dropped so many weapons by eating food	 or just picking other♥♥♥♥♥♥up to begin with. This is a MAJOR issue that needs to be fixed right now and I can't believe it's even a problem. #2 issue	 I'm currently sitting at 66 hours played while I'm writing this review and I have still YET to find a person in-game. My server has over 150 people in it	 and only 1 person has 1 kill. That is beyond unacceptable. I'm not asking for PUBG	 but I'm asking for more action. I've been camping the airport in B2 for over 30+ hours and have NOT seen 1 person!! WTF??? Like	 I'm having fun with the game and I'm all looted up with end game gear but what is the point if the world seems so dead???? At this point it's a walking♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥simulator from my own experience. I'm sure i'll run into somebody at some point (god I hope) but 66 hours and no player vs player action is a sad sad day in my gaming world. #3 issue	 the servers are so shot. I was fulled decked out in gear at the airport camping WASN'T even moving. I get DC'd but upon logging back in	 my character has somehow walked out into the empty field and got 2 pieced by a robot. WTF??? 20 hours down the drain. Why the hell does the character move forward if there is a DC and orginally I'm at a standstill? I just don't see the logic in that at all.Please please PLEASE fix these issues. I already know this game will be great	 and I'm willing and still playing the game heavily even though I have so many negative opinions about it.TLDR; Don't purchase the game just yet. Let them fix the bugs and issues before investing."
513710	1	0	jakegamingthing	18	2	1	7.0	September 9	 201	I tried playing the game for almost 2hours and it was fun and exciting and sometimes scarybut I decided to get a refund because of the following:- FPS drop is insane and my 1060 can't barely handle the game- People teleporting even @ 50msI will still give it another chance once they've optimized the game for poor PC specs users
513710	2	0	BEEPBEEPSHEEP	178	8	-1	2.0	September 9	 201	"It's a DayZ clone with some extra interesting mechanics. It's definitely better than DayZ in terms of it's overall feel	 but it's clunky	 it's not very interesting and it's overall not very fun unless you're looking for that same dull repeating activity of hunt for scarce loot in an environment that just repeats and isn't very interesting.It's the best one to come out that's not DayZ but there's better choices out there with more to them than this.[EDIT]It's not a bad game by any means	 but i can't recommend it simply because it's not my cup of tea. No game aside from the most modern version of the DayZ standalone has captured the feeling of the Arma survival mods even closely to the same extent	 making this something i can't recommend over just playing Arma 3 exile	 or even arma 2 DayZ mods still. The Hand to Hand combat is basically the only thing unique to SCUM and it feels fine enough for me to say it's probably the best hand to hand combat in a survival game. The robots feel gimicky but i can't really complain since they're trying to add something unique to the experience of risk/reward looting	 but i went through 5 different bases and the big robots aren't exactly difficult to avoid."

I do understand that this game is in early access	 so for the readers they can take this review with that in mind. The amount of time it takes to move around the map is insane. So if you consider this game make sure you have a lot of time to spend just moving around the map. It will take a lot of your time. Once you get to where you are going	 you run the risk that it has already been looted and there is nothing there.The whole game in itself I believe is created for a small community of players (which is fine). Expect a sharp learning curve although I do not believe it is too overwhelming it just takes some time to get used to. I do not believe that it is completely optimized yet so it should be better soon. The concept is pretty cool but there is only 64 people allowed per server as of now (I hope this gets greatly increased later). In the few hours I have in this game I have only seen maybe a handful of people	 even though the server was ""full"".The combat is quite glitchy in melee combat. Rifles seemed to be mostly ok. The map is absolutely huge...I dare say it would take you hours to walk diagonally across it	 and at least an hour to go up and down or across. TL;DR - Save your money for now and wait unless you know you are committed to this game and the time it takes to invest into it."

Visually the game is absolutely stunning	 moving on to be one of the most realistic scenery I've seen in a multiplayer survival game. It has its hiccups that can be ironed out with proper optimization	 as with any early access game. I can run this at 40 to 60 fps on epic regularly with a 970 gtx	 4690k cpu	 and 12gb ram. But when it slows down the who game grinds to a halt before catching up and throwing you across the path of an enemy very quickly. Said problem noticed one all lowest graphics as well.Right now	 the visual aspect is all this game has. It promises to set a new standard for survivalist gameplay	 but has a long way to go before hitting that mark. This is the bitter sweet side to early access	 we get to play a few hours but there is nothing to do.Currently most character customization is locked	 same story with crafting. Once you understand the basics of crafting	 thats about it. So far all of the towns are the same. Aimlessly search homes for food	 get yourself some clean rags	 make a currently useless lean to	 and a firepit you can stand on top of without damage to cook a few slabs of meat.. thats about it. Some towns have mechs who wreck you	 some outskirts have bears. I was just expecting much more at the start from a game  who wants to take on the challenge of removing the sour taste in many if our mouths from other survivalist games that have disappointed. I have played 10h and it feels like a grindy FPS currently. My fingers are crossed and I will continue to have high hopes for this game	 and trust that the updates will bring us solid new content that will give us a reason to play. But at the moment	 I cannot recommend a game that I have already gotten uninterested in	 and leaves me feeling very bored."

The game boasts some incredible graphics thanks to the unreal engine	 in depth weapons ballistics	 metabolism	 weather system and crafting. The gameplay itself is surpisingly STEALTH based as you sneak around heavily guarded military bases to find high end loot. You can group up with friends and earn 'fame' through in-game activities	 this fame is used to join public events and different types of spawn locations. Your name is also displayed on the event leaderboards based on your fame amount. There's many more features I will list below	 but for an Early Access title and at this price point of just £15.49	 you get a big bang for your buck. So buy it	 find some friends and give it a go! Pros:GraphicsUnique GameplayWeapon BallisticsCraftingSquadsIn-game mapWildlife-huntingMetabolism SystemStealth ElementsAreas for Improvement:Sound Design and Directional Sound- The gun sounds are a bit flat and could use some work in giving a more realistic impression (reverb ambience and hard hitting transients)- The directional sound is sometimes misleading and gives the impression a zombie or mech is closer than they actually are.Crafting and Vicinity list- The vicinity list when trying to craft items gets overbearing	 this could be fixed by placing items in categories?

This game combines several things I love to do in a single game that's been evolving all the time. It's challenging and it's addictive. Highly recommend it	 and I cannot wait to see what comes out next!I will give you fair warning as appreciation for reading my review thus far. You don't keep your storage containers	 or your shelters when you log out. Even in single player which	 due to my internet connection	 is all I play. I still have a ball	 and the maps are GIGANTIC!

Getting about 6 people together to bring down some of the mechs that roam the military installations is also very fun. Pvp is brutal	 no exploits	 no jumping around to make you harder to hit. It is straight up raw fighting. Some firefights can last for 30 minutes	 including tracking and hunting a player down after they run away.  However at the moment with the game in early access there is alot of desync when fighting other people	 melee fights specfically. Also there are server crashes that happen frequently but it is early access after all. Overall this is honestly one of the best	 most in depth survival games i have played so far and i really enjoy it and reccommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games.Also you can put a knife in your boot. 8/10"

This game is already much more fun to play that Dayz still is after years of development. Gameplay mechanics are a mix of Arma/Dayz and Rust in my opinion. Devs seem to be doing a great job on pushing development forward	 i.e implementing anticheat just a few days after the first release (take notes Bluehole!). If you love survival games	 like I do	 i can recommend you to join in the fun now	 but if you want a polished game experience you might as well wait and give it some time. I have played a little over 6 hours	 all in one sitting	 and had a great time playing with a friend. Looking forward to what the devs bring us! Keep up the great work!+Love everything about the survival aspects+Good graphics+Great atmosphere+Clearly a game with A LOT of potential-Poor netcode (players often lag around making pvp frustrating at times)-Complicated inventory system (but then again	 there is a lot of possibilities of crafting/combining and so on)-Game needs a decent ammount of optimization to run smoothly-Obviously very early in development-Needs vehicles!"

513710	29	6	monkeh81	145	4	-1	61.1	September 4	 201	In short: wait until the game has reached a further state of development and judge again. Right now the game is not worth it unless you are really looking for a DayZ 2.0 with a high likelyness of lagging and stuttering due to poor optimization.+ Good graphics+ Crafting (tho at the moment it's a bit  underwhelming as military loot is too easy to obtain)+ Extensive digestion system (got shot in the head while taking a crap)+ Zombies/Puppets feel more threatening than in DayZ unless you are loaded up with guns- Bad optimization (in my case on a high end PC it runs very poorly and is unplayable due to stuttering every 5 to 10 secs)- If you want your own server you'll have to pay for it (NO private hosting)- If you're not based in western Europe you might have a very bad connection as the only available servers are based in the UKThe gameplay itself is very playable and if you experience no performance issues and can join servers without having any lag you'll be fine but beware that the risk of you having either of those issues is very likely.From me a thumbs down as the game runs like sh*t and we can't host our own servers without having to pay for it.

It appears that the distance between your corpse/your surviving friends was made purposefully as an obstacle (you need to pay higher points to revive in the same sector)	 thus sapping all the joy and fun out of a multiplayer session with friends.At the current state the game also has intense memory leak and is not recommended for people having less than 16GB RAM."

Had some great tense moments sneaking into a base where the Ed 209 like Robots are waiting but if you go slow you can sneak past or brave and stupid (like me) just run with a Gatling Gun kicking up the dirt around you.I've met a mix of players	 on one occasion after being almost fully kitted I spotted someone crouch following me	 so I said in Voice chat I can see you at which point he attacked me with a saw	 being a peaceful I ran away trying desparatley to switch to  a shotguin with ammo which I managed to do and got a great shot off but thought I ran out of ammo again so switched weapon and managed to drop my shotgun and fall into the harbour. The other player managed to pick up my shot gun and empty its remaining 5 shots at me as I tried to get to the surface. I managed to climb out and finish him off with a 22 rifle. I then ran off to my little base Id set up but the shots had summoned a sawrm of Zeds and I died trying to fight them off.On another occasion I had scared of a Donkey and tried to hunt it with spear which I missed after running after it into some woods I saw it dead on the road and another player in the woods opposite. After my 1st expeience with other players I was more cautious so I crouched and watched him for a bit then saw him fly into the air as a boar had charged him.  So I snuck up behind where I saw him	 crouched low and going slow I saw him ahead of me his back to me bandaging his wounds from the boar charge	 I got closer to him and being typically English I waited for him to stop bandaging stood up coughed and said hello at which point I think he jumped and turned said in almost perfect Oxford English hello and offered to cook some meat from the donkey.So far throughly enjoying the game	 looks like more crafting options will be added plus vehilces at some point as during character ceration it does show greyed out driving skills."

They've patched it twice in the first 24 hours to fix bug issues (Unlike what blueballs did).  It flows better than that abandonware dayz.That being said	 there are a lot of gameplay issues that aren't bug related-Fame is for respawning. -Fame rate gain isn't the same across each player-If you don't have enough fame to spawn near your body	 the ""Respawn with nothing"" and ""Very slow"" progression system encourages players to disconnect and re-roll their character until they are near their body. (Which also resets their fame	 which	 if you don't have enough fame to spawn near your body	 chances are	 you're close to 0 anyway	 if not negative)-Combat system isn't the best	  Gunplay is ok	 Melee needs to get its head out of its♥♥♥♥♥Example:  I have a 5 strength character with advanced melee skill.  (You can spawn with this).  It takes no less than 5 hits with an axe to kill a zombie. There is also no way to sneak up on a zombie and kill it from behind	 which takes me to my next issue-The stealth skill also seems pointless	 Robots have godmode and godvision (They can see you across the map).

With such a huge map and such a small number of player per server it's really a problem.I really love the overly complicated system which I did master in 5 minute	 but it gets old pretty quick too. My 30 minutes play already made me bored with the system.

Tab is inventory and the inventory is a mess of ""what the hell do I do"" nonsense.  They're trying to make it realistic	 but it comes off as just unintuitive.  For instance	 you won't typically find a gun with a magazine and bullets in it.  Once you finally find all 3	 you need to put the gun in your hand to load mags	 you need to put the mag outside of the gun inventory to load bullets.  Nothing is ever drag/drop	 and nothing will give you a hint.  Good luck figuring out the health guages without a youtube video as well.  Energy is never explained....I still don't get it.There isn't that much content either.  HUGE map	 but it's the same 2 zombies (skinny and fat) and the giant mec.  Houses are copy pasted so everytime you find a new place it looks exactly the same as the last.  Items are scattted oddly.  I spent a large part of the game just running and stopping to search boxes often to find a rubber band or the same magazine to a gun I don't have.Suggestions:-Game needs more enemies	 maybe natural like bees	 bears or wolves (might be in the game	 but I never seen one).  -The inventory system should be re-worked. I don't mind the idea of pockets with it	 but needing to put items in different screens is a lesson in frustration.-Story line/goal/destination. Game seems sort of pointless.-Needs vehicles.  The traveling is boring and tedious.-Desperately needs more house models/zombie models/character features/etc.."

I'll advise anyone to play with a friend	 it is even more fun then. Don't expect this to be the next big thing tho	 cause it wont be."

The game	 for an early release	 runs superbly. Beautiful game. I have played for 50 hours now and i have many more to come. For £15 its a bargain. One thing that i would like to see it some sort of base building which i believe they are doing in the form of building fortifications in the future but this isnt a complaint just something i would love to see take this amazing game to the next level. A solid 8.5/10"

This is an awesome game	 made by legendary developers. People should stop crying about ""omg i spawned with 2 zombies and i diiiiied	 theres so muuuch walkiiing omggggg"". ♥♥♥♥ off. You wont find a better bargain deal than 20 bucks for a game of this scale ALREADY	 let alone the fact that its going to be ongoingly developed for a good while. This game doesn't deserve the ""mixed"" reviews status. Also i guess this is turning into more of a rant on the people reviewing this game	 but ""omg bugs you guys DONT BUY"" is the stupidest way to discredit a game and the developers efforts at it. Its EARLY ACCESS	 theres a disclaimer everywhere	 so please if you have negative things to say about the game	 post it on a forum and stop ruining this beautiful games reputation."

513710	0	0	corgination	34	1	1	17.9	September 3	 201	"This is my first time playing a survival-style game (other than The Long Dark) and I would have to say that I am impressed with the quality and quantity of what's included for the $20 price tag. I've tried Rust twice and just never really got into it and I always wanted to play DayZ Standalone but the price and reviews really pushed me away from making that purchase. I would have to say that SCUM fulfilled my desire for what I'm looking for in a survival game. Pros: -For my rig (parts listed at the bottom)	 the game is very well optimized. I've been playing on 1440p on max settings and I get 60-80 frames with very minimal drops or stutters in framerate. My friend on a lower end rig (with a beefy 1070 I sold to him) was getting a consistent frame rate on normal settings with minimal frame drops. He didn't say how many frames he got as he didn't have a frame counter on	 but he was very impressed with how it ran due to his experience with low FPS and stutters on other games such as Fortnite	 even on low settings.-I like that the game doesn't hold your hand in terms of telling you how to craft things	 how to stay healthy	 where to find loot	 etc. There are plenty of guides on the Reddit and various Youtube channels that get you started	 but you aren't forced to use them. I used the guides during my first few hours of play due to my very limited game time each day	 but learning some things on my own was extremely satisfying.-Despite being Walking Simulator 2018	 the game was still an enjoyable experience solo to just put on a video or stream and relax	 or having random conversations with friends before a raid	 or talking about the last hour after looting a military base.-Its BEAUTIFUL. The graphical fidelity of this game is truly mesmerizing	 considering that its only in early access and its not a triple A title. My friend and I legitimately gasped in amazement after a rainstorm had passed and the sunlight peaked through the trees with realistic rays of light. I can honestly say that I have yet to play another game where the ambient environment looked THIS good.-This could be a pro or a con	 depending on how you look at it	 but its relatively easy to get kitted within an hour of making a character if you know where to look. As someone that doesn't have a lot of time to play during the weekdays	 its definitely a pro. I can spend some time at a military base and get the necessary gear and ammo to go do whatever I want to do	 unlike what I've heard about DayZ	 where it can take -hours- to get kitted and lose it all in an instant. Cons: -There are times when the game can get very tedious and boring	 especially when you are in an area that lacks supplies	 such as food	 and you need to venture out for upwards of an hour to gather resources and bring it back to camp. Although	 I can also understand that this is part of the game design	 and I do know that vehicles are planned	 which will help with not spending most of your time walking instead of participating in other parts of the game.-There needs to be an easier way to play with friends	 whether that be inviting a friend to a server without having to figure out the IP address	 or spawning in the same sector in order to group up. My group was lucky to have spawned within the same sector	 or one sector away	 instead of being spread out across the map and spending the first hour or two attempting to regroup.-More of a petty complaint	 clothing previews need to better reflect what the piece of clothing actually looks like on your person. Some darker	 greener pieces of gear can look completely different on your person than what's shown in the inventory.-You shouldn't have to pay any Fame to get a random sector spawn	 in the case you join a new server and somehow die very quickly. It sucks to get negative fame early on	 despite how easy it is to gain fame once you get going. Suggestions: -More gun variety. I know that this is planned but it would be cool to see more lower-tiered rifles that can be found in towns	 cities	 or farms	 such as hunting shotguns or hunting rifles. A more reliable way for people to get firearms instead of going to a police station or military base (where those weapon would be more powerful. High risk	 high reward	 duh).-Maybe I'm just unlucky or looking in the wrong places	 there needs to be a more consistent way of being able to find food that is high in sugar or carbs. For now	 it is very easy to get protein and fat just from eating zombies	 but my characters have always had trouble keeping carb and sugar intake above 0% for any longer than 30 minutes.-FOV slider	 pleaaaaaase. Final Notes Just to be clear	 I haven't really experienced much PVP or many player interactions	 as I have mainly been playing on a low population server. My playstyle is more PVE oriented and that's simply how I like to play	 so I can't really offer any review on the PVP performance of the game.For how recently this game just released on early access	 I would say that it is as polished as an early access game can be. Of course	 there are the occasional bugs or glitches	 but none that I have experienced that were game breaking. If you're into survival games	 or wanted something like DayZ but never played it due to the same reasons as me	 pick this up if you have $20 lying around. I can see myself playing this game for a long time so as long as the devs continue to add content and more things to do. Parts List for Reference 8700K OC'd to 4.3ghz1080ti16gb 3200mhz ram"

It's a very shallow game right now because nothing is finished.  What I liked: Idea of starting from nothing against other players	 zombies	 mechs.What I disliked? there's no systems fully hashed out yet. sure you can craft a campfire and make an apple pie.. but why go through that trouble when you can eat the flesh of dead zombies without cooking it. Yea there's guns  but the game desyncs from the server so it's spray full auto or wait for someone to stop moving.The mechs and zombies are pretty lackluster	 easily defeated by line of sight and doors.I had a good time initially and had fun but there's a lot to be desired. Maybe one day I'll revisit the game because the world is really beautiful and interesting but with Fallout 76 around the corner... I doubt I will."

If you're anything at all like me	 you normally wouldn't think that blancing your diet	 managing your calorie intake	 and making sure to excercize to balance your calorie intake and energy expenditure. Those sound like the kind of features that are too realistic and would detract from the fun by getting in the way of the action. However	 it really doesn't feel that way in practice	 and neither do any of the features in this game at present. They end up working phenomenally well together	 complementing each other in an excellent way. The nutrition system adds an extra layer of incentive to head into a town to get more than just animal meat in order to balance your doet and hit your vitamin goals. To be clear	 you don't HAVE to do this	 optimizing your nutrition is just an added minigame and you'll survive as long as you're eating something	 but it only serves to add to the depth of the game. That's generally how the systems in SCUM work	 and it's largely due to the philosophy of the developers	 which is that if they're forced to choose between a gameplay element that's fun or one that's realistic	 they pick the fun one every time. The end product	 at this point	 is an incredibly unique	 well-balanced and immensely fun open-world survival game. The developers themselves absolutely deserve some praise- I was hesitant to leave a review in the first couple of days since the game launched without ultra widescreen support or anti-cheat and was plagued by some server issues. However	 they've been hard at work over the past few days putting out 3 major patches since launch that have added anti-cheat and fixed the server disconnection issues. They also teased a picture of one of the devs working on 31:9 display compatibility which I expect within the next couple days. So far	 the devs have yet to disappoint me	 and based on how reactive and hard-working they've been	 I have high hopes. Now	 just to be completely fair	 there are absolutely a few issues. There are still a few bugs and glitches	 players will teleport around the map when their ping is anything over 80	 and it seems like the sentries patrolling the military bunkers have the perpencity to spot you through cracks in doors and through cover sometimes. I've encourtered some assorted Early Access-style bugs and glitches involving wonky animations or weird physics	 and I've already seen a few squads of Cinese players teleporting around the map with 300+ ping. All of those issues in mind	 I absolutely recommend SCUM. I don't believe it's a DayZ killer or anything like that	 but I think that both games can coexist together. Thumbs up."

This Game can be a top contender due to the fact of the PVP/PVE/Survival aspect.CONS1. When playing in a group you should be able to spawn with your buddy or at least be close by not on opposite ends of the map	 it takes to long to enjoy the game when you have to walk to find them. (MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A WALKING/RUNNING SIMULATOR)2. Jumping out of windows from inside house will sometimes clip you thru the ground and you get stuck(Luckliy I was able to get back into the windo and it fixed it.)3. Taking a poop while zombie attacks you	 Causes you no damage(Was able to reproduce this 3 times)4. Taking a poop/peeing/vomiting should be interuptable to be able to move or save yourself.5.Guns AK etc clip thru char with gear on6. Stoves inside houses should be able to be used for cooking incase folks are unable to make fires7. Breath meter or at least a lung capacity to show how long you have under water8. Ingame voice needs to be tweaked for better clarity9. Fix it so you can hit a zombie from in house thru the open window(I tried to stab punch and never hit the zombie	Only when I shot them did the hits register.)10. I fully understand this is a Early Access game and thats the reason I chose to buy the supporter pack to further support this game and all future additions forthcoming.11. This is by far the worst thing about the game	 When you and your buddy are in a group we should be able to see our groups arrows so we can get to them easier.(Only in a group setting though)12. Show a char pane for when your in groupI love this game and as long as it keeps going in the direction it is and not just turn into a BR with no need for survival or pve. I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT THIS GAME HOLDS IN THE FUTURE"

It has an i7 8750h (6 cores) and a 1060 max-q	 and it can play games on max settings and remain fairly cool for an inch thick laptop.

Scum	 I can play at any settings	 at ~50fps (it doesnt change for some reason) and within 5 minutes of playing	 my gpu hits 80C and cpu hits 100C.

So far I have taken a liking to just exploring. Everywhere you turn is a wonder of scenery. There are times that I will walk along the road and actually get dejavu. The artists who designed the landscape have done utterly superb. Nevermind the dam. At your leisure get over to it and just peer over the side. The view is excellent in about 4 different languages. Secondly	 the combat reminds me of another game	 but it's cleaner. It's not like H1Z1 where all you do is tap	 tap	 tap.. Nah	 b	 nah. You have to time your swings and maintain distance from these zombies. With that	 there is plenty to be done to increase immersion in stressful situations. Though	 I have used zombies as a means to relieve myself of hostile individuals. I've been ranting on about H1Z1 not having similar capabilities for years!My last point is that this game has so much potential. All of the skills and nutritional jazz are artifacts of just that. I truly cannot wait to see what is implemented in the future."

You can run around the 12kmx12km map looting	 crafting	 and PvP'ing as advertised... mostly. The concept is much like DayZ where you are dropped onto a map with nothing but the clothes on your back being chased by zombies and other players who want your loot. The PvP action is fairly slowed paced and the loot grind can be a bit long. The game mechanics force you to spend a decent amount of time tending to your nutritional needs and stamina. The idea is to be more of a survival type of game & less of a fast paced twitch PvP type of game. The game is also fairly bare bones atm. The things you can craft is fairly limited and you'll exhaust the novelty of everything you can craft fairly soon.Overall	 this seems to me to be a ""working concept"" type of early access game. I have no idea where this game will end up	 but the concept was cool enough to get my support and the game itself is playable.... for the most part."

I see many complain about lag	 but ive not had many issues on my computer as of yet. then again	 the one time i  have fought another player	 was when i snuck up on him with a wooden spear to the face.I ate his leg soon afterwords.If you worry about the lag in PVP	 then there is a Single player mode.

It takes a while to learn how to craft and survive but once you get going its a lot of fun exploring and looting. There's so much detail in this game that I can tell a lot of love has been put in to it.I have a 1050ti and an AMD A8 6600k. Which some sites told me would not even achieve the minimum specs. So far the game runs not too bad (30-40fps on epic) but every now and then I get lagg spikes when entering a new town(dunno if thats my CPU or the game optimization).

I'm a few hours in and already like it more than the failed DayZ standalone. Now that game was a cash grab. Keep up the good work on this game. It has the potential to be great.

The large number of stats along with the ""metabolism"" feature make every player character unique and each have their own weaknesses depending on how they eat and treat their body. A great survival game so far. Can't wait to see what happens over the next couple years."

With a multiplayer game you really need to implement anticheat before releasing it as it's only going to increase the number of dislikes	 thus deter others from giving it a go.For £15 it's alright	 i've spent about 15hrs on it	 not really done much	 i'll try and do some crafting when i can find a bag big enough to carry enough stuff to craft an item.Please add base building	 lockers etc...i think having bases will make this game so much better."

As much as I love spending 2 hours of wandering on foot	 collecting rocks; this wasn't for me. This game needed a third party chat to ensure groups could organise multiplayer games and it wasn't easy. Solo play wasn't exactly entertaining either. In terms of intuaitve	 not yet	 your ability to craft without research isn't simple and takes time	 and if you think this will compare to PUBG; Don't. You won't be finding weapons any time soon	 or rounds in the same location. This game is time consuming and lacks reward when hunting for resources and equipment endlessly for no real reward. I wasn't impressed. I may revisit closer to release but not for now."

Sure there is some networking problems and the problem with cheaters	 those will most likely be handled in the future. Would recommend!"

The biggest problem that plaqued it for a while was the Lack of Anticheat. The game now however has added EAC to the game and is dealing with the hackers (Script Kiddies) easily.The combat is fluid	 Animations are nice and the combat is very fun.The Gun play is great (Actually hurt... ALOT) and even the zombies put up a threat.Best part is pooping... Nuff said.PROS:- Gunplay is great.- Puppets are cool.- Most connection issues are ironed out except if you have bad internet.- Robots are challenging.CONS:- Constant Server Wipes (All progress is lost)- Desync happens a bit.- Learning Curve.- KoS is very much a thing.On the topic of Server Wipes and Early Access. I completely understand that the game is EA... This however does that excuse the fact that EVERYTIME a update is released you lose all progress in the game. And because of this reason I say the game is Unplayable in its current form until the developers fix the issue of needing to wipe the data every update.If you can deal with this flaw	 then i say the game is well worth the money to play it. If you cannot then bypass this game until the dev's get things undercontrol.If you can deal with the wipes: 8/10If you cannot deal with the wipes: 2/10"

But I wont recommend you play it at this early stage.Why you should not play this game:- If you play on a low pop server you barely see anyone and fighting mechs and puppets (zombies) only entertains for so long.- If you go on a high pop server there will be so much desync that fighting people is a pain in the a55.- As nearly all other survival pvp games before	 this game draws the attention of a lot cheaters. Losing all your gear to people with ESP	 no-recoil	 teleportaion and immortality kinda sucks. And in my opinion was ""Easy Anti Cheat"" more of a cost related choice buy the devs.I know this is in early access and this is stuff that is to be expected. The announced content seems very entertaining and the game already has a good structure. I have high hopes for SCUM and think the price at the moment is very good. That's why you should buy this game now and play it when it's more enjoyable. I'm sorry I have to give this game a thumbs down but the devs should really feel the urge to fix the mentioned problems.

513710	2	0	neal1211	256	38	-1	26.2	September 8	 201	"EDIT - GAME RUNS IN YOUR BACKGROUND WHILE NOT PLAYING! CAUTION	 NO IDEA WHAT ITS DOING!   I encountered steam telling me the game was still open when I had not played it in over a day. I found it running in the background on a minimal state	 like 1% use. Now I cant return it I am sure so I am very angry about this. But the more concern is	 what was the game doing open after it was supposed to be closed?Nothing more than a walking simulator with a zombie	 sometimes 2 but no more than 2	 mixed in. The devs really threw us on this one.I was really expecting a lot more from this upon its release. The developers had spammed us with information but when you get into the game	 its pretty bleak right now. Not much to do other than what feels like a copy/clone of DayZ. Literally a clone. The map looks like the DayZ map and even the world itself looks like the same island. This was a bit of a turn off for me as I don't want another DayZ. There wasn't much to do either. I kept running out of stamina after following the road for ages. I would come across the occasional house with nothing of interest inside or around it. Sometimes the houses had nothing at all which was very disappointing - and this was during single player so nobody could have looted it.The zombies are zombies. Just like every other game out there. Really nothing special. When I encountered one I felt like I was being chased by a combination of DayZ and H1Z1 zombie. Buggy and boring. Doube Bs.So I did not spend much time in this	 I can only handle so much road following to an empty house with nothing in it. The game isnt offering anything new. Everything in it you can find in other games. Heck - DayZ is pretty far in and its basically the same game as this.  I am sorry devs	 I would not recommend this game in its current state. Sure its EA but you should have released it with some special features to make it stand out more and make it less of a walking simulator. I thought it was funny how people were rating this game before it was even released with praise and positive enlightenment. Man those reviews were wrong thats for sure and probably the only thing going for them. I would avoid those ones."

No support for 3440x1440. You can play the game	 but you can't craft. The menu is cut off and the only way to play is either in a compressed	 ♥♥♥♥♥♥	 pixelated resolution	 or in windowed mode which is cancerous on an UW. For a resolution becoming more and more prominent (especially with games running UE4 ffs)	 there should be no reason as to why something so obvious was overlooked	 and not even tested.. Can't say I recommend the game to anyone with an ultrawide at the moment. And the combat is also trash. No hit registration when you're literally ♥♥♥♥ing the zombie in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't get any closer	 yet they can hit you with no problem. Until these two major issues are addressed	 I can't say I recommend anyone spend the $20 as of yet	 if they're looking to play the game with little frustration. I really hope it gets fixed	 because believe me	 I've been waiting for a looooong time for a game like this to be released. The concept is amazing	 but the delivery was poor."

The metabolism immersion isn't as intuitive or deep. Just get all your stuff to green and dont worry about it. Extremely boring after gearing up. Decent game to play with your pals but this is not a revolutionary nor an intervention experience.

It will just take time since it just came out.I am enjoying this game suprisingly since I usually don't like these types of games and I think this positive outlook is a good thing since this means to me that this is something different that can be enjoyed by different types of people. It can be a bit of a walking simulator and sometimes boring if you do not have a friend with you but they are going to add in missions	 npcs	 and on so from what I heard.I personally can't wait to see what the developers will add in next.8.4/10"

I guess you can say its what dayz should've been with the stats and customization. Even though its very limited right now	 in the future it'll be better. The servers are kinda choppy as of right now and they're fixing that. It is a beautiful game though. I played 3 hours and returned it due to lack of in game content. But it is an early access game so that's to be expected. Also you can play single player but whats the point of that when there's no story to back it up. Its just another open world survival.

The biggest part of this game are the mechs and this is where patience and strategy comes in. (I have over 25 hours and have never died to the mechs	 personally I think they are a bit too easy.)Don't listen to all the negative reviews	 they are all just made by players who have no patience and all of them have only played an hour or 2	 you can look through the negative reviews. This game is AMAZING for its cheap price	 if you are looking to purchase I recommend purchasing now as the price will increase as it gets closer to v1.0.The only CONS of this game so far is the performance and memory loss	 and the server desync when trying to fight someone.If you are looking for a new survival game and/or a game to play with friends for hours on end I HIGHLY recommend this game."

I have played many survival games	 I have owned Day Z stand alone since its EA debut	 but this game blows them out of the water in its EA debut. The map is extremely huge	 the environment is immersive	 the indepth tracking and maintaining of health is also fun but also a challenge	 not like dayz where food was non exsistent and you would die from simple dehydration or simple hunger. This game is forgiving in that sense but also unforgiving if you neglect your health. The devs seem as if they truly care about their game and you can see it. I had given up on survival games but SCUM has reignited my interest. Not that I would wish anyone ill will	 but	 Day Z devs and discussion board brown nosers	 suck it	 I hope all 1000 players of your player base leave	 you guys are the worst and show a lack of creativity	 work ethic and general integrity.

Even when you play the events its just people teleporting back and forth everywhere	 its a mess.I like the metabolism system	 prob the game's coolest feature.

To collect all the loot.. just to have it all stolen while youre offline because you cannot build bases in this game.. No way to lock up your inventory. Litteraly its free game for anyone who finds it. even a new player just starting. Needs bulding mode or this game is pointless. 4/10

With developers (So far) staying up on the game and being active a forums I have faith in this game.

I was strarving hungry and after i was blasted in the arm by another prisoner on the island i had managed to flee into a nearby wooded area and hide while my prisoner was slowly bleeding to death. I took a small knife i had looted from one of the houses earlier and used it to cut my nice baseball cap into some strips and then used them to dress my wounds. After another hike to a small town near some water i was attacked by a zombie and after smacking it several times in the face it layed doen in front of me. I was now in major need of food now and their was only one real source of food. Must say he tasted better than he looked.

But this one is already a winner.Find a bed.Pee on it.Crap on it.Vomit on it.Get 2 bottles of Whiskey.  Drink them. Vomit.Find Random mushrooms in forest.Eat them.Vomit.Hallucinate.Crawl through all that mess and fist fight a bear.11/10 Would pee on bear in middle of fight and die.

However	 the devs have already proven themselves much more attentive and capable than most AAA developers out there. The game is constantly being worked on and improved	 one little bit at a time. Even now	 it surpasses DayZ in content and quality (in my opinion). The gun play is still very iffy at close range	 but medium and long range engagements are top notch. Once the lag issues get put down for good (this only affects some servers it seems	 as others are absolutely perfect with 0 rubber-banding)	 this will be an absolutely fantastic game."
513710	3	0	NYCbaby	82	4	1	101.1	September 3	 201	"Should you get SCUM? - If you enjoy hardcore in-depth survival games that are complex and offer a certain level of difficulty to survive along with tactical PvP	 you are going to love SCUM.  Please note: as an early access game	 expect to have some lag	 occasional server crashes	 FPS drops	 d-sync	 etc. If you aren't the patient kind who can deal with this for a while	 do yourself a favor and don't play early access games. You will only get frustrated.  Instead	 wait until the game gets properly optimized down the line.I have been playing on a fairly populated server with some friends since the moment that the game got released. To give you an idea	 the server crashes 2-4 times in about 8 hrs. of game play. When it happens	 you can't open any doors or containers	 loot	 shoot	 etc. for about 2-3 min. The good news is that you won't have to restart the game and the servers are back up immediately. So you won't experience any downtime and have to wait around. My PC specs include: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti	 Asus X99-DELUXE ATX  Corsair Dominator Platinum 16GB and an Intel Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz. The game is installed on a Samsung 950 PRO Series M.2 Internal SSD. I usually get anywhere between 60 & 100 FPS. They drop near structures and when it rains	 as well as during PvP events (most people's biggest frustration at the moment.) The DEVs have already said that they are working to optimize it. Now	 onto the content:There is a lot to explore and a good amount of points of interests (POIs) around the map. -35 towns of various sizes	 15 of which feature police stations (a good place to look for guns	 ammo and gear.)- Heavily-guarded military-style POIs	 such as an airfield (currently the hottest spot on the map for PvP)	 a prison	 a factory	 a train yard and a gun range; plus some hunting camps	 outposts and bunkers (with awesome & plentiful loot!) The sentries (robots) guarding these POIs will annihilate you. - There is plenty of loot and it's well-balanced around the map. If you have a group of friends to play with	 I recommend joining a well-populated server with 40-60 people on it. The map is big	 so expect to be running around quite a bit	 at least until they implement functional vehicles. According to their roadmap	 those should be coming in Patch 1.0 along with several other exciting features (building fortification	 an advanced crafting system	 larger urban areas and safe zones.)No	 the game is not a running/eating simulator. Yes	 you have to keep an eye on your food intake and expenditure and you do run a lot. You have to keep an eye on what & how much you eat/drink	 as well as your basic needs (including getting sick and metabolism.) After all	 it is a survival game and a hardcore one at that. If you stay in the rain for an hour and have 3 layers of wet clothes on your character	 expect him to get hypothermia. You would then have to treat it by removing the wet clothes and/or staying close to a lit fire. If you eat mushrooms	 you might end up being poisoned and would need to take activated charcoal. If you get attacked by a zombie	 you'd have to patch your wounds. You get the picture. There is currently no base building or house fortification. You can place a shelter in an area of your choosing. Respawning on it costs -75 Fame points. You can also craft wooden chests for storage. But make sure that you hide them well	 because anyone who finds them will be able to access the contents and steal your loot. Once crafted	 shelters and storage chests cannot be moved	 only destroyed. (I am hoping to see a change for that.) Note that you do not get materials back after destroying them.If you get bored and are looking for some PvP	 you can buy your way into PvP events (TDM or free-for-all) on various maps. In short	 your character gets teleported onto an arena	 fully geared with your weapons of choice. You can then PvP against other players on your server in the matter of about 10 min. It costs Fame points to participate in events. And you get said points by doing things in game - killing zombies & other players	 performing tasks and crafting.The best part about this game is its developers. I couldn't say enough nice things about them. They are simply awesome. Here's why: - They are very active and do a good job keeping up with people's questions & suggestions - both on the SCUM Discord and Steam's message boards. - 4 great patches with a ton of improvements issued in just 4 days. - Most importantly - they communicate with their player base	 which is something that many ""survival games"" developers often fail to do. - Their vision for the game's direction and where they would like to take it sounds great as well. All in all	 SCUM has a lot of potential. It is engaging and I'm looking forward to seeing it develop further."

The combat is really nice	 the events are a fun change of pace	 the amount of loot you find is damn near perfect	 doesn't take 8 hours to get geared but also not 20 mins.

The graphics are amazing for this early of a game. The mechanics feel pretty good but everything else is extremely broken. Lag in any online server all the time	 cant kill anyone because they rubberband everywhere and lag and its not possible to hit them. The zombies are very very strong	 they should be an easy kill and add a bit more of them into the game. It doesnt feel like a survivale game due to the fact you almost never find very good supplies. Loot spawns need to be buffed before I ever reccomend. The game has no replay value	 nothing much to do. Map is huge and no sort of telaportation to friends or anything isnt possible. So you have to kill yourself to get lucky and spawn close. I really want to support the game	 so I will. Giving it a thumbs down will show the devs to keep fixing the game. I really hope this game becomes the next big thing."

Now when i finaly self can play it.  I barely have a chance to make a diffrent on my man Firstly	  You can only choice a man.  4-5 diffrent heads and with tatoos.  you can only make you character personally by changing between how much mucle/fat/thin you are.  Nothing about how tall you like to be. or the weight of you person. You have very few skills to choice between. most of it is still locked.After only 2 min online. The server crashed. i startet up in singleplayer. in less than 30 sec later. Suddenly my character bugged and changing from as how i have made him 	 To a big fat man.  so i leaved my singleplayer game.  Now when i look in the menu.  I now have a big fat man in singleplayer i never self have made.So what do i have left for fun?. a multiplayer game that still is unstable.   a character system that still is lacking alot	 and even bugging so you maybe end losing you character after using time playing.    It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.

However this game is detailed	 creepy and quite interesting. A bit over the top Zombies	 like I have seen them jump a 3 meter tall barbed wire fence like nothing at something 30 km/h..a bit lame.LOTS of weapons	 NO ammo and oh Zombs dont really die from chestshot :) Its REALLY hard to kill them by hand and you need some effort to outrun them.Mechs are nicely done though - good balance.its got its fair share of bugs and needs a lot of extensions. Cities are practically empty	 except for the ninja zombies present :)Surviving is a bit hard	 especially if you want fame as well. Metabolism and wheather system rocks. You DO need food!Looks good boys. Apart from the random lag	 the game is fine. Needs a lot of polish but its NOT another Dayz implement. This CAN actually make it."

But just remember this game is early access as ♥♥♥♥ right now. So we all know that means.. lotta mother♥♥♥♥in bugs. Bugs (or at least I think they're bugs) I have spotted/experienced that have left me dumbfounded or in my early grave - mechs have incredible view distance	 like	 150M plus view distance	 makes sneaking hard asf when you can't get near a bunker! - When hiding in a house	 mechs sometimes come up to the building randomly	 without saying a warning. Then also proceed to shoot through walls	 and keep insane eye contact with you. - Zombies have been lagging through walls - Metabolism (energy) goes to zero when spawning in (when respawning) This game is awesome	 even in early access	 and with all its bugs!

I was really hoping SCUM was going to be fun but tbh it is just really	 really boring. Maybe I was expecting something more exiting from the trailers but it's just a boring endeavour of trying to figure out how to even start a %%£% fire to cook some food because the guy is always %^£%£  hungry it seems.  I searched so many houses and hardly ever find anything and the only good stuff is guarded by terrorist robots that I can't kill. Anyway I got in a few military places because every other place is just a waste of time and got an automatic gun. Trying to find ammo for it is a nightmare but anyway I get some	  load and off I go to kill some zombies		 aim and bang	 it fires once	 WTF	 reload	 bang once	 reload	 dead from multiple zombies. BORING! There should be way more stuff to find and ammo to shoot the guns with. Plus I don't need to spend ages starting a fire to cook some £%£%	  I don't mind a bit of having to cook but it would be much better if it was much easier to do. Ok	 you want to waste a lot of time cooking whatever		  to me it's just to much of a hassle and I play games to have fun. This game is as boring as the stuff he squats to do every so often	 that part is funny though. I tried to like this game and gave it some hours to see if it would get better	 but factually atm it's just really boring ( I know I keep saying that) and if I could have got my money back before I realised how BORING it is I would have done so.. Maybe in the future it will be something	 but I doubt it because if they (devs) can't even make cooking (or finding other food) easy because they think people want to wast tons of time doing menial things (maybe some do) in a ""survival"" game and that searching dozens of houses and finding nothing much is actually BORING  then I can't see this game ever being fun to play	 for me at least. Also I saw the comment one of the devs made about removing the Nazi tattoo from the game and his attitude was ""don't like it don't play""	 until he was forced to apologise. Ok				 ""^*&%** you too"" sort of thing	 give me my money back then. Anyway....thumbs down for now bt that could change if the game gets better	 I hope it does."

I promist my self i won't ever buys SCUM	 But all of my friends has recommended me playing it and been on the game for hours. i decided to try it. All my friend liked it but for me it was disappointing. The game is not ever nearly complete.It's in a very early early access version. Bounch missing features	 content. Mechanics are broken	 and unbalanced. currently the game it's just a glorify <Unturned>. you go in houses and loots stuff. there are some times zombies in the streets you can kill . which you can also eat em if you manage to kill one. and it gave you so much food (human steaks for dayz) now the game does have a metabolism mechanic. but it's over compecated sometimes and it's just numbers. most casule players like me really don't feel like to deal with it. now so much critizism of the games so far. i do have to say i got the game on it's very. very early stage of development. But like i said. this early access game is far worst than others. most other you can play it's close to finish. but this one is about 5%-10% comple?(and for the♥♥♥♥♥♥shit mechanic. i get it. it's an essential need of human. i would hope there are are options of disabling it. for more pve servers i guess. or skipping animations for pve servers. it's just down right disgusting. ya it is kinda holiarious if you pee on your teammates imaturely but it's really childish and gets old really quick)"

When your WAY over for example	 sugar	 it doesn't matter. However if your under it	 it matters. It's DayZ's hiking simulator all over again. Only this time with AI mechs and zombies. Once your in a bunker	 there's nothing to worry about	 which I think is dumb. Add zombies down there so it's just not a loot free for all. I tried to get a refund for the game but steam denied me. So 28 bucks is just going to sit in my steam acct not getting played. Like ALOT of other games that I tried but didn't like and couldn't get a refund. Maybe in the future they'll take away the nutrients and mineral aspect or at least tone it down so you don't have to play Doctor	 lab technician and nurse while trying to avoid zombies and run across the map."

The game looks overall fantastic and all but when you meet other players and get into fights it feels like your opponents is playing on a network powered by a hamster wheel. The desync is just insane which makes it impossible to peak and hide around corners. The other player goes invisible when running around and then suddenly pops up out of nowhere.  Just teleporting around when in a gunfight doesn't feel good.The only things you do in this game is survive	 loot	 explore and DIE IN LAGGY PVP. (needs alot of work if they want to keep the game alive)  Thats why i cannot recommend this game but i may change my mind in the future if they manage to fix it."

VERY DIFFICULT. Even if you have a pistol.- I found a pistol and mf didnt come with a mag.. really?- Doesn't explain anything. you just start confused.- Death means you lose everything	 and it's very difficult to stay alive.I would loot for hours and walk around	 but as soon as I see a group of zombies	 it's game over and I have to start over.

There are also issues with rendering other players	 making them invisible. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to have a good and fair pvp fight. I will likely change my review when they fix these issues. I do understand its only in EA but the game should still be kinda playable like most other EA games.

Skill progression where you level up and get better as you do certain actions	 giving you a reason to play. In-depth metabolism system which keeps looting interesting and adds another thing to maintain while playing. Realistic hunting system that is actually meaningful. In-depth crafting system. Every weapon in the game can be deadly. A sickness system exists which keeps you in check	 so you have to balance between picking your fights and taking care of yourself. You can group up with players in the game and respawn directly to them if you have enough fame points. The map is part of the GUI which you can bring up whenever and you always know where you are. Creative developers that are capable of programing ideas into a reality. Developers frequently update the game. Climbing	 vaulting	 and proning all already exist within the game.  Realistic animal and puppet AI.Cons Lots of hackers. Barely anyone participates in events	 mainly because that's not what the game is about	 making this feature be pointless and attracts the wrong crowd. You rarely see players because the map is too big and the population cap per server is too low. There is a memory leak	 which means you have to logout every now and then to retain high fps. Desyncing issues	 possibly the worst I've ever seen in a game. Getting the best gear in the game is just way too easy	 mainly because military bases exist and are easy to get into. Developers have already wiped official servers twice in a row within just a week	 way too frequent even for an early access game	 especially since the game has an RPG skill system. Clothes have very limited inventory	 making most crafting be done on the ground which is annoying.This is so far my most favorite game and something I asked for a long time. I enjoy realism	 a challenge	 progression	 and survival. If you do too	 then this is your dream game. This game is worth more than $20 in my honest opinion."

We have:- sophisticated crafting- best human organism simulation since Deus (don't mistake it with Deus Ex - totally different games)- foraging	 hunting- nice graphicsRoom for improvement:- there should be at least few guidelines for most basic equipment crafting (sort of tutorial - just to introduce player with crafting system);- a little bit more animals (I've played 1	5h and encountered just one boar and I've been in deep forest);- fighting - I had a spear and I used it just like a bat instead of stabbing move;- from what I've seen	 some people are nagging about optimization (for me it was more or less stable 50 FPS on epic settings 1080p (i7 7700	 GTX 1060)Overall - if devs keep working on the title	 we may yet have the very best and most sophisticated multiplayer survival game.As for servers - I figured there would be problems on the start	 so I began with single player game to learn mechanics.

Looked fun to play. once in the game servers kept crashing (could be from loads of people joining at once) and it was difficult to find a server that would let you in to begin with (kept getting connection timeouts). There is also no way to join your friends direct unless you have the name or ip of the server. Would reccomend waiting till game has a few new features and patches added (like a friends tab in the servers menu) and servers are stable and allow you to join first time.

In my opinion that is not a valid reason not to pick up this game because boy does it have content and is it worth the measley $20 that it costs.

The realism is nice to have	 but a big turn off for me is the not so real aspect of loosing everything but what is on your person everytime you log back in and all of your points being reset to zero. In real life that would not happen. You wouldn't go to sleep at night and completely forgot everything you knew to make	 and that your makeshift camp is gone. One thought I have is	 how do players cope with this in multi-player? The other thing I wish that could be possible is the ability to play on LAN only. I haven't looked at all at multi-player in anyway simply due to the two issues above. I'd also like to note that there is quite a bit of lag in areas with larger towns/cities. I turned everything down and quite a few things off just to be able to go to those areas and I still lag. I wouldn't recommend this at this point in time. Maybe as time goes on and changes are made I will consider updating my review."

Look	 here's the ugly right away: right now there are frequent server restarts and hella desync issues. I think their anticheat engine isn't great either. So	 for PVP	 it's in a bad place today. Also	 I'm not in love with the UI and crafting system.But the saving graces for me are all the things this game is promising to be. The metabolic components are interesting and create an extra layer of preparation for raiding-minded characters	 the melee combat doesn't feel like an afterthought and is imho very satisfying	 the loot is varied and most things seem to serve a purpose	 crafting is dense. This is the survival game most people wanted in DayZ 	 and seems further along than DayZ was a year or two after launch."

Combat feels horrible and clunky and it takes about 20+ punches to kill somebody. Servers randomly crash	 looting feels clunky and not very fulfilling. I played for 70mins straight without dying and in that time i couldnt even loot the whole small village that i was in (only about half of it	 some people might think thats good but imagine playing for over an hour and pretty much making no progress and constantly getting nothing or scrap metal which you dont know how to use	 which bring me to my next point. The crafting system and ui are so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to understand and require so many things just to craft basics; there is no crafting guide or small tutorial telling you how to use it or what you should try and craft first. The map is too big for only 64 players max and the fact you cant loot very fast which makes this game feels like watching paint dry. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game until they stop focusing on making this game look flashy and actually focus on what matters e.g. mechanics and gameplay."

It would seem that the devs learned too much from other games of the gentre and tried not to repeat the same mistakes. Even though it's an early access alpha	 the game is definetely steps away from most of the games with years of ""experience"". Although like every other game	 it also comes with negatives that i won't bother to talk about cause	 it's early access so nobody should even bother to point them out.DO NOT buy this game if you're not fan of the gentre	 if you like straight up shooting people go for other games	 in this game	 you have to struggle to get a weapon/gear in a crowded server and in a less croweded server	 even if you do find it	 well you won't find players to kill"
513710	1	0	scyrehawk	306	4	1	43.0	August 30	 201	"To put it simply	 if you were someone who enjoyed DayZ mod (aka when DayZ was actually good) then you will enjoy this. It captures all the feel and threat of survival	 all the ruthlessness while building on what it with the addition of the robotic guards and zombies that actually behave somewhat like they have a clue. In all honesty	 Scum has the potential to unseat the rivals in the zombie survival genre	 as it is arguably already doing it better than most of it's predecessors.The complaints people are having with server performance	 would only be valid if they game had actually be in the wild for a number of months	 it hasn't.The complaints people have had about framerates show how little they actually understand about development processes. There is plenty of room to tweak down settings to get stable FPS and frankly I'd rather at this stage the developers focused on content rather than dithering about with optimising too heavily. It will come in time.There is a good reason that this game has at the time of this review been selling well	 it really does already compete with it's competition in genre. My advice would be give it a go and realize that this is a developmental early access title	 not one using early access as beta testing before quick flipping to release. All things will come with time	 be patient."

I have been playing video games for a long time and can see 3 main issues with this game.  1. takes WAYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOO LONGGGG to run around the map with zero transportation2. You can spend hours and hours looting to lose it all when you die3. Need to make crafting more user friendlySolutions would be as follows - Make transportation available or allow the character to run without having to stop which goes against the point of this game.  So you basically have to make transportation or too many people won't play because they don't want to spend 30 to 40 minutes running between towns.  Maybe do something silmilar to world of warcraft where we all have ""mounts"" we can ""summon"".  World of Warcract I will use again for the 2nd issue.  The fact that you can loot for hours	 take so much time out of your day to die and not have anything?  This isn't PUBG or other similiar games	 YOUR MAP DOES NOT REDUCE to force players into combat.  So obviously this issue is not just a minor issue but major considering its a leading factor of why I do not want to play.  Last of the 3 main issues is crafting.  You can't find a guide to know what you need	 so how can a basic player know what they need?  Get a clue you guys	 have gamers help you because this game is a wow and pubg in one	 lots of potentiel but♥♥♥♥♥♥if left to this model.  Game will die within 3 months.  Last thing I want to mention is add FILTERS to the search for servers.  My friends and i spent 40 minutes looking for the damn server.  GET GAMERS ADVICE!"

The game stutters constantly on any setting for me. this game plays as if someone took pubg threw in some crafting items	 some zombies	 bears	 and a ton of weapons you will never find the ammo for. its a cool concept but the way it was put together and thrown out into early access is honestly pretty gross. this game needs WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more work before even attempting to put this on Early access...this game right now is pretty much like rust without houses. you cant build anything	 the zombies are kinda lame	 bears are OP and about the only things they got right are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanics.

It has a lot of promise and that release day will surely produce a great game. I'm just not sure if it'll pull through to be the best survival game ever made?Initally	 I thought this game was going to be overwhelming. Just given the intricacies explained in the videos etc. Zombies + mechs!!! But overall	 everything turned out to be quite simple.  The convoluted system are really ... just simple in the end... Consider that when that pooping and eating are no longer factors.... When the AI mechanics become far too predicatable. Then you realize the end game that consists of cooking with pots ... it becomes depressing. You expect to farm players	 but run-ins are a rare occurance. Even then	 the lag + character vision is a cocktail for frustating deaths.Overall	 I cannot recommend this game currently. There are many exploits and bugs in the game which break the ideas developers had in mind. Something as small as an infinite stamia glitch allows players to run indefintely thus altering the way the game plays out. I think when those are corrected	 this game will be epic."

However	 if you dont enjoy survival games where you run around the map for the entirity of the gameplay with very little pvp i would not reccomend this game. I have refunded the game as i didnt enjoy my 2 hours of playing it."
513710	1	0	76561197978348394	111	11	1	117.3	September 9	 201	"So as of this review I have 100+ hours in the game (during the first two weeks after release) and I can say that most of the negative reviews don't seem to understand a few basic concepts that need to be understood:a) This is pre alpha and has limited content	 bugs	 etc. duh.b) Character awareness dictates vision of other characters. If your character can't ""see"" someone then you don't have vision of them. This is important because people lose vision of an enemy and think they're teleporting or something	 but its just that their character doesn't see them. This can make it look like they teleport as you gain and lose vision of a target.c) This is not a battle royale game. Its primarily a survival game with elements of other things in it.I'm running a fairly average gaming rig. I built it five years ago but recently upgraded to a 1080. I almost never get frame drops	 tearing	 or any other gfx issues (outside of actual bugs) but I hear other people complain about that stuff. With that out of the way: The game definitely needs to be polished and a lot of content added (derp	 its an alpha	 no kidding) but what it has is mostly functional and fun to play. I don't play a lot of these kinds of games	 but almost getting murdered and having all of your gear taken is a rush. Its been a long time since I've gotten those sweaty palms and pit in my stomach from a video game and this one does that for me. For those of you actually interested in an in depth survival game with a persistent world then I hope this will be the game for us. What the devs have planned sounds amazing and if they even get half of it implemented and polished then it'll be the most amazing game on the market. Even with what is probably 10-15% of the game being active at this time its still pretty deep and I'm still trying to figure out the best ways to do things."

Run around loot things	 what little you can find.the graphics are nice the weather is a nice touch.  The biggest problems with this game are: There isnt enough content.  You can go into houses or buildings and  loot what you are able to find but there really isnt much to even find.  Not enough animals	 not enough zombies. Nothing about the game is scary or makes me feel as if I need to -survive -  other then constantly needing to find food. The worst part of the game I found to be crafting.  There are a lot of things you can craft but there is no clear guidence or instruction on how to craft things.   Then what you craft either drops on the ground and you need to look for it or it disappears.  Such as	 if you find a pot to cook your food. The pot disappears once youve eaten the food.   That is if you can manage to even figure out how to craft a campfire or cook whatever food you do manage to find.  I managed to eat raw corn and somehow make popcorn without a fire but it does nothing really to sustain you.   Switching items from inventory or inventory to hand is easy once you spend a while figuring out how to do it and not drop things on accident. The way the crafting works is pitiful	 it could use an overhaul imo. All in all the game has potential and could turn out to be really good.  The graphics are great	 the exploring is fun.  As it stands not enough content 	 the crafting is more work to figure out then surviving.  Not enough loot.  I realize it is early access and these things  could change in the future but for now I dont recommend it.  Give it time."
513710	3	0	JakeFenrir	113	8	-1	3.4	September 9	 201	"A game with potential	 but not one that I would reccomend in its current state. It's no secret that this is an early access game;  If you're looking to get an early investment into a survival game	 this might be for you. Personally I think the game should have been developed further before being released publically; I hope that this early release is not a sign of short funding this early in the development	 because then we may end up looking at yet another unfinished Early Access game rotting in our libraries."

This game is a great realistic-arcade survival mixture	 to the point where you have a PRECISE amount of fun in all scenarios around the map and throughout the game.For those of you looking for the nitty gritty	 the games optimization is made to run on the epic graphics scale which is beautiful yet confusing. Either way your game looks amazing as well as runs pretty good on the epic setting! The gameplay is fantastic with an OK crafting system	 and a THRILLING way to approach the Sentries in your own special way so you can get that military gear! SCUM shows constant bug fixes and constant content updates almost 1 to 2 times a week.  Overall	 Updates are CONSTANT involving teasers for vehicles and new weapons incoming! The gameplay is intriguing and engaging	 The team is HAPPY to do what they do	 and the gun play is something you'd have to try for yourself to see how smooth it feels! Good luck and see you around the prison!                                                                                    9.5/10 ~G"

I mean kinda	 theres a big robot in this game ive never seen in other survival games	 and yea theres a nutrition system and some other stuff about eating. But what makes this game different from games like DayZ and Rust and Ark and all the other very similar survival games? In my opinion	 nothing. All these new mechanics of an interesting game are seemingly well constructed but Ive played 30 minutes of this and of course I havent experienced the entire game	 I dont need to	 its the same with this game and every other survival shooter post apocolyptic zombie crafting building raiding pvp game so experiencing the game is to raid the bunkers guarded by the robots and loot and walk for miles on end looking for some gun that I can find only 1 mag for and a couple bullets only to ultimately get shot by a squad of players and restart the entire process of walking across the map to the only military base and repeat and repeat.  This game is not better than DayZ   and we all know how bad dayz is  I know open world survival games arent known for their replayability and yeah they should be played with friends but my main point of this review is that this is the same game as all the other survival games on steam	 of course with its own little twist like a tedious nutrition system and ""realistic"" stats. I do not recomend this"

Game is actually fun	 my only real gripes are the clunky aiming system and game content missing but that's no different from any other early access game on launch but for its current price it's actually very good value compared to nearly all early access games.What really is the issue is squad spawning and the robots	 mostly the robots at the moment. don't get me wrong I think the robots are actually really cool idea and make PvP more interesting but the reason I'm making this review is because there is a lot of issues with its detection. They keep making changes to accuracy and bullet spread and such but that isn't the issue.The detection is broken. It's rare for it see you through some walls but it still happens but the real problem is it can see you through A LOT of objects.. Trees	 creates	 generators	 cargo containers and more. If it can see you through it can also shoot you through it as well from what I've seen. The robots detection mechanic needs a massive revamp on how it sees people and they need to be taken out of the game in the mean time. It's actually ridiculous atm so I'm not going to play until it's fixed. There isn't any point in playing when most of the combat takes place at military installations only to get shot through a object by a robot for the seventh time in a row."

Disclaimer: I have not played multiplayer yet  and will edit when I do.Rating then Explination:Graphics: 8Music: 6Content: 4Controls: 8Gameplay: 5Graphics: I found that the graphics for this game are pretty decent and they put effort into little details that make it more engaging (when you shoot metal walls bullets pass through and you can see light through the holes). The game really studders and lags for me soon as I get into the game which is a problem but I have an older rig and once they get further into development I hope that improves.Music and sounds: I enjoy the ambience a lot. Everything sounds great except I feel there should be a little variation or ""shuffle"" on the puppet sounds. I can hear the loop rather clearly. Bad weather sounds great as well as the mechs.Content: There is a lot of content that has no connection yet: Haven't found a use for rubber bands	 car batteries	 or jumper cables- but I am sure that all is waiting for a future update. Single player is kind of rough	 not much to do except bully the mechs and run around. map is huge	 larger than the DayZ map for sure	 which makes it a long haul anywhere single player. Butchering corpses and looting is fun and I enjoy the complexity of the metabolism system.Controls: The controls are unique and although it takes a bit to understand how it works	 flows well for me. I play essentially with one hand which is hard with a lot of games but not this one. scroll wheel for changing your walk/jog/run speed is great and love the crafting/inventory system (lighting a fire you ""select"" lighter/match/etc. as well as the campfire then select ""light"" as an example.Gameplay: Nearly nonexistant in single player but still can find things to do. Multiplayer I am looking forward to when I try it out."

Ontop of the connection lost and not being able to continue your progress	 you CAN'T even go into a different server because you loose all of your items and equipment	 in other words you can't transfer your character or items. what's crazy to me is that i CAN'T connect to the server with my current progress becuse it gives me a ""connection lost"" but i can connect to the server only if i start a new character and start fresh... It's an OK game and has lots of potential but please fix the server issues	 i and im sure others as well would'nt want to have to start new characters from scatch every time just to be able to be able to enter your server. With that said the Graphics are some of the best if not the best i've seen in a survival game	 playing solo is OK so i recommend you play with a friend or make some friends.

The most basic of functions are frustrating	 over complicated and very time consuming.  It brings a new definition to the term  ""grind fest"".

Originally I only had 3 hours under my belt	 now I'm closer to 20 hours playtime. I'll update again when I'm close to 100 hours.This is an interesting game	 but not in a bad way. There's plenty of places to explore	 mechanics to learn	 underground bunkers to raid. Sure	 the biometric system is pretty... well	 frustrating deep	 but even in early access there's a huge map to explore and plenty of people to... well... Hunt.Let me backtrack by saying I'm a normal	 peace loving guy. In real life	 I officiate weddings	 kiss babys on the forehead	 sample the fruits of my states legal cannabis market	 volunteer at animal shelters... Normal People Stuff. I am not	 by any definition	 what you would consider a psychopath. At least... I didn't used to think I was. Now I'm having doubts.When I first posted my original review	 I had a couple PVP encounters that I frankly found hilarious	 and for this review to make sense	 I'll share them again;""Sneaked into a base teeming with zombies and giant walking mechs. Spent 40 minutes tensely sneaking around the mechs	 fighting zombies and looting. RANDOM DUDE SHOWS UP we end up in a gun fight. He runs out of ammo	 I end up killing him with a hatchet. I then chop him up and eat him	 raw.I died of dihherea from eating him about 10 minutes later.Another time	 I was minding my own business in a farm house. RANDOM DUDE SHOWS UP. I have no weapons but a few improvised spears. He's shooting up the place	 so I book it to a nearby group of trees. Eventually we're in the thick of the woods	 I'm hiding behind a tree and he's about 10 feet away from me shooting as he advances.Suddenly he stops. He starts pooping. He immediately screams 'OH NO	 TRUCE TRUCE TRU-' and I threw a spear through his face	 killing him instantly. Then I peed on him. And then yes	 I ate him.""Initially	 I thought these encounters were one offs. Hilarious	 granted	 but one offs none the less. After posting the original review	 I even encountered strangers who wanted to 'team up.' I prefer to play solo	 so I always turned these offers down and we all went our seperate ways	 unrobbed. Alive.At some point	 and I don't know exactly when or how this came about	 I stopped having 'friendly' encounters. It wasn't that other people were becoming more aggressive. It was that I'd stopped approaching other players with good intent. I wasn't even trying to rob them	 or simply scare the pants off them. I Was Hunting Them.You see	 I don't eat boar	 bear	 deer or goat. I don't even eat puppets. Before the recent character wipe (9/5/18) I had a backpack full of... Human Steak. Sure	 I eat the random mushroom	 canned foods or vegetables that I can find	 but my diet is almost entirely comprised of Other People. It sends the biometrics off the bloody charts! Why bother scrounging for meals when meals will walk right up to you and literally say 'Hello'??Considering the nature of this game	 that isn't that bad... right?I mean	 it's a game about convicts in an ultra authoritarian corporatocracy fighting to the death on a prison island turned game show... but my story gets worse.I carry my last victims head around in my backpack. It's also assigned to my #3 slot for easy access. Why	 you ask? It's simple; if I catch someone who's obviously unarmed	 I show them the head. Not immediately	 mind you. I like to play with my food	 after all. I talk to them first. Ask if they're playing alone	 if they're new... If they're Hungry. I'll start a fire	 make a few kebabs. Let them eat one. Then I explain where the meat came from. I place the head on the ground for them to inspect.I do this because I like to hear the mounting alarm in their voices. I like to hear them panic as they start to realize that I'm not even slightly friendly.They always run. Sometimes after I tell them what they've eatten or after inspecting the head. My favorites are those people that just sit there laughing	 eatting my very own variation of 'iguana on a stick	' utterly oblivious to whats about to happen...But they always start running	 one way or another. Wouldn't be fun if they didn't. And I always chase them	 cackling like the lunatic that I'm slowly realizing I truely am	 until I catch them and murder them with an axe.Sure	 sometimes I have to resort to methods with a little less panache but a kill is a kill	 and a meal is a meal...Since I've never	 ever	 played a game like this before	 I simply assumed this was what everyone did. I mean	 this is sort of the point of the game... right? I didn't realize how bad I'd gotten until some RL friends of mine joined my server. They were witness to a few of my more... artistic kills. At first	 they thought it was funny but now... well	 they're worried about me. Legitimately worried. They're offering to help me pay for therapy but...10/10	 I'll probably end up eatting them in this game too."

Gunplay feels good	 combat is fast and deadly	 loot rates are at just the right levels and high danger areas offer plentiful rewards. The micromanagement of your nutrition is surprisingly not tedious or a detriment to the gameplay like I'd thought it would have been.If you enjoy the process of gearing up	 having difficulty deciding what to take and what to leave behind	 being cautious of any person you run across	 and then having to inevitably defend your posessions from some greedy opportunists	 this game is for you. It has a long way to go before it can be considered a complete game	 but it's Early Access for a reason and I look forward to keeping pace with the developers as their vision is realized."

513710	2	0	Igelkotte	53	1	1	27.1	August 31	 201	"This game is awesome. It's a DayZ kind of game that actually works and has 10 times more detail in both your character and the enviorment.Even though it has only been in early acces for two days it works really well. The only problem I can see right now is the lagging players which makes it hard to engage PVP. PROS:+ The enviormentThe enviorment design and nature detail is amazing. It actually looks like a real forest for once.+ GraphicsGreat lightning and detail in the foilage+Metabolism detailYou can see excactly what vitamins you need. You can see what body temprature you have. if you need more carbs etc.And everything you do has an impact on those stats. And the stats have an impact on how your character works.+Deathmatch modeIf you are bored of looting you can always join a deathmatch event which teleports you to a specific area with full gear.You can just practice PVP with no risk of losing anything.+GameplayAll the new thinking ideas blows me away even though they probably needs some tweeking. The ""anti 3rd person peaking"" is great. I really like the potential of how the camouflage/hiding/awareness works. It makes you not having a disadvantage when having high graphic settings.CONS:-Lagging players / netcodeThe biggest problem I can see right now is the lagging players	 which makes it hard to engage PVP. -Servers going downRight now you have to reconnect once in a while. Keep in mind that this review is only after two sessions of playing and the game is only two days into early acces. The potential of this game is huge."

I was following it for a while	 watching their update videos on youtube passively and was surprised when I seen it pop up on the Steam store as I wasn't following the release. I was particularly excited for this game as I'm a huge fan of games like DayZ	 H1Z1	 etc. Except of all those suck. The only one I really enjoyed was the original DayZ Epoch Mod for Arma II. Compared to DayZ SA	 H1Z1	 etc... This game falls short.Graphically	 it's good. It's smooth	 and the looting is similar to H1Z1 with the timer. Character	 the character is pretty much the same as DayZ SA. 2 Primary slots	 and whatever clothing inventory slots.Looting	 the loot spawns pretty good. No complaints really. Not nearly as cancerous as DayZ SA was/is.PVP	 horrendous. Desync is pretty bad on populated servers. Even worse than DayZ SA surprisingly. I'm sure less populated servers don't have this issue	 but the ones where you actually want to encounter people will.AI	 the AI isn't bad. The zombie pathing is pretty good and the ragdoll adds immersion. The flying robot AI is pretty good	 even if it just adds to the environment and doesn't really affect anything. The Mechs are kind of annoying. They just add unnecessary waiting time to everything when you're looting. I would definitely prefer just having maybe 2x or 3x the amount of zombies to high-threat areas to make it more risk/reward.The crafting is pretty good. There's a variety of different things to craft. Nothing really new to the survival genre. Similar to H1Z1.Ultimately	 the game's just... OK. Is it worth 20$? I guess. Maybe wait for it to be updated a bit and a bit more content. I only give a negative in it's current state. If I could give a neutral I would because there's definitely promise in this game. I've just been too disappointed	 like most of you	 by survival games always ending up flopping."

You aren't supposed to easily get the highest tiered loot in any game	 and mechs stick to routes	 You figure out how to avoid and stealth around them. Play smarter. That being said	 this is the best and most promising EA surivival title I've ever played. Its got the rough around the edges EA part	 but its far from unplayable. The mechanics	 gunplay	 etc are all workable and fun as hell. And day one	 they improved it with a patch with more on the way. If you were a DayZ/ARMA fan	 welcome home. This is where you belong. This game with friends is super fun. Hunting	 killing	 foraging	 looting	 setting up a camp	 etc. Dying doesnt feel like the end since you keep your stats and can spawn near friends if you have the points from a long	 well lived character thats done things. Its worth the 20 bucks	 man. I'm going to give them the other 10 to support them even more.

To me	 this game feels and looks a little like what early PUBG was without the necessity to kill others or feel like you're playing a holocaust simulator as the gas gets closer. No	 this isn't a battle royale. This game is a survival game. Take that as you will.The devs are marvelous seeing as they do constant updates and respond to the community; added anti-cheat almost immediately after hacker reports	 working on single player persistence	 quick fixing servers	 etc. I'm not here to review the devs but that's honestly always a huge plus when it comes to Early Access	 or any game. Look at what happened to PUBG and Dayz for example.Gameplay seems alright so far but if you're not a fan of survival I can see this not being your game yet. The map is ♥♥♥♥ing expansive to the point it might take a while to see another player until you charge hotspots like the airport. Personally I feel the barren wasteland feeling adds to the survival aspect yet takes away from some tension. That's where the npcs come in like the Drone who comes by to reveal your position and film you	 the puppets (read as zombies)	 and bears/wildlife. So	 if you're not into walking around and managing your health then prepare to get burned out. Otherwise enjoy the fear of another player waiting for the perfect oppurtunity to jump you.Gunplay. Oh ♥♥♥♥	 the gunplay. Guns work pretty well except the realistic loading of magazines and docking it to a gun feels somewhat clunky. Bullets hit the target quite accurately with a nice touch of recoil. Scopes are immersive also but throwing spears even have a nice little indicator. Graphics and misc. in this game are pretty nice little details. Running on maxed out graphics and having everything on feels beautiful even if I'm staring at a bald head in third person or have tons of head bob in first. The little details of the grass and trees are pretty cool too but there should be an option for head bob imo since people get dizzy. Also did I mention you can chop people up and eat them? Then take their head as a trophy and proceed to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over them and take a good ol'♥♥♥♥♥♥just for fun? Yeah	 do that. Just be careful to not over fill your stomach and manage your health or else you'll slowly die or turn the game into♥♥♥♥♥Blasters 96'.

Just a recommendation.Scum in its current	 early access state	 is entertaining to play alone or in single player mode	 but an absolute blast if you have some friends to play with. It's a solid EA (Early Access	 please keep Electronic Arts as far away from this game as possible) product	 entertaining on its own	 but the real entertainment comes from playing with friends.If you enjoyed the DayZ ARMA mod you already have a good idea of what this game feels like to play. The zombies (puppets) are much less challenging in Scum	 but the mechs that guard high value sites help to make up for that lack of challenge and also push players into a stealth/planning style of gameplay.Don't be deterred by the complex underbelly. You'll spend less time obsessing over your diet and exercise than the BCU monitor would have you think. But the systems already in the game do address some of the most annoying problems with any pvp shooter game	 such as lack of distant cover rendering and the advantage of third person view being able to see around corners or over walls.This game is a lot of fun and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style of game."

Realism: You have to eat	 drink	 treat sicknesses	 deal with physical injuries and mental issues	 you have to watch calorie intake/water intake etc to make sure you are healthy. There's a full metabolism system which is awesome. You have to pee	 poop and vomit accordingly based off of your body's needs	 which is awesome but can make for some hard situations where you decide to poop in a corner only to have somebody or a Mech robot walk around and shoot you before you finish. Combat: 3rd person combat isn't too bad	 the crosshair's a little ugly but it works fine	 however I mostly use 3rd person for looting as there's a feature in this game where it intends to make 3rd/1st person views equal by only showing you other players (and animals	 etc) in your direct line of vision as it would if you were in 1st person. So basically no standing around a corner and waiting for someone to walk up close to pop out; you have to physically peek out or move out to see whats on the other side. Guns feel nice to use	 haven't had any jam on me yet but I know it can happen. Ammo for most guns is relatively easy to find if you are searching bases and military outposts	 I found the hardest to find to be the AK47 ammo. The melee system is nice too	 it locks on when it should and unlocks when it should and to fight somebody with fists or a melee weapon with your skill at atleast basic or above will feel nice.I've had lots of fun with about 6-7 of my friends	 we found a nice cosy place that's hidden and safe and around everything we need	 we made shelter and loot crates to keep our supplies in while we are out and about	 and to spawn back at if we die. It's fun to go out with friends on loot missions/raids and bring back your supplies to keep the camp running like food	 water	 weapons	 ammo and clothing. Overall it's a pretty indepth game and the devs are QUICK to respond to bugs and issues in the game.

Clothing only drops in the world which i have no problem with	 but your own character can only be male	 you can decide an age between 20 and 50 which has minimal effects on looks and basically no effect on stats as you can change it to what you want no matter the age	 and there are 4 premade faces. those are the only character customizasion options which is so lacking	 especially compared to what it looked like in the trailer.the other aspects are mostly just go into empty towns to loot in a pubg style looting system	 loot military bases that are the same as towns but with way better loot but there are also (kinda easy to dodge) deadly robots guarding them. the last part of the exploration comes down to running around an almost empty open forest with animal and zombie encounters once in a rainy day.this game has a lot of potential	 and i only hope it furfills the hopes of the people supporting it. untill then unless youre really into this kind of game i really wouldnt reccomend it	 especially for how high of a price it asks from you."

513710	0	0	NTAGZ	468	28	1	24.6	September 10	 201	Really have been enjoying this game a whole lot and its even better when you play it with a group of friends.Pros :-Loot is pretty easy to find-metabolism management where you have to keep track of your characters vitals-different character stats so you can make different builds of characters-mechs and zombies add a challenge-have a map by default-can spawn on your friends or in different places by earning fame points ( easy to meet up with friends )-party system so you can tell where your friends are-many different types of weapons and ammunition- is realistic but not so realistic as to not make it a fun gamecons- memory leak after around 30 minutes of gameplay where you have to relog to get your fps back up- need a minimum of 16gb of ram to play because of the memory leak ( i have 16gb luckily )-has some desync issues where zombies or players will skip around sometimes-i don't like the feature if your holding something in your hands and you pick something else up your character will just toss the other item you were holding on the ground. This causes sometimes losing of weapons if you didn't notice you dropped it .

Obviously its still early access	 so servers crash	 but I only experienced one bug (stuck in crafting menu	 had to log out). But so far Ive played 20 hours and had a really good time. I would reccomend playing with a buddy as you will be running around between towns/bunkers/points of interest	 so lots of time for conversation. (But Ive heard they will bring cars into the game	 so that could make travelling quite fun/running over people/zombies)So basically I had the highlight of my gaming career over the weekend. We were tracking some dude for a little while	 he was around 450m away. A sniper shot while he was running would be potentially quite risky and give away our position. However	 due to the insane realism of this game	 said player decided to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥in an open field. Fair to say that 450m SVD shot was something he didnt count on. So the take away message.

SCUM will provide the developers with a monumental amount of work. This game could be worked on pretty much indefinately. I hope that when they release new content that they don't ""drip feed"" us. For example	 the stab proof vest crafting addition recently is really quite insignificant. There is a dire need for a major update that change up how this game is played and encourages us to keep playing.We have been playing for over a week now	 on privately owned servers of our own and on the public servers. Learning how to play the game has been enjoyable but once you learn how to play and geared yourself up you really are waiting for something else to do that is meaningful	 motivation to play for us plummeted a great deal at this point. Items you find are many times better than what you craft	 this makes crafting seems quite pointless. Crafting is severely limited at the moment and is in desperate need of expansion many times over (not just one item at a time). There is nothing really to build up towards	 nothing to aim for. Crafting helps you right at the start of a new character but then as you progress it becomes less and less important which is a shame. One of the biggest things I don't like is the ""copy/pasting"" of a number of buildings	 it kills the atmosphere of the game	 rooms are the same and it can make the game feel a little souless and repetitive. Given they are planning to put much detail everywhere else this seems something they should improve upon.Yes this is early access so we have to accept that the game isn't finished	 but if there is no periodic major updates which changes up this game and keeps us playing I'm afraid much of the hype that SCUM initially created will fizzle out. I recommend SCUM if the updates come in steady. If the updates trickle through then you better have a lot of patience if you are still playing	 we have stopped playing and now wait for some major updates to improve the variety of gameplay.  The potential this game has keeps me very interested to follow the future developments and at the moment this optimism makes me lean towards recommending others to try this out. If the game stays as it is at the moment it cannot be recommended to play	 there is just not enough content	 I also cannot recommend buying this game at the moment if the updates to gameplay are snailspeed slow	 play something else and come back to SCUM once it has some major updates under its belt."

First of all loosing characters & gear is really frustrating but Hay! guys	 com'on this game was £15!! & is still VERY much in early access. Take pubg for example. Amazing game! But it defo had it's problems...for quite a long time!! I know this game will soon top the number 1! spot here on steam	 & so it should. The game	 The visuals	 The game play	 & the whole feel of the game is	 spot on! What I would like to see is... base defense!! I want to make a fire and chill at my base/shelter but always on edge if some one picks up on the flames	 tries to sneak up	 kills me & takes all my LOOT!! for example: empty cans	 Instead of just littering this beautiful scenery	 lets make traps with them? Put a stone or 2 in it & attach it to some wire around camp and listen for the sneaky SCUM trying to enter my home!!	 Just like in real life. I really need fishing in this game	 something very simple like in WOW/ World Of Warcraft mechanics. 1 long stick	 wire & a hook! Cast in lakes and rivers & lets watch our protein burst through the roof and energy rise to the top!!  I cannot fault the game at this time & if your thinking of waiting to join the fun!	 DON'T! Get the game today and support the devs in thier efforts of bringing this game alive & where it is today! Your gonna miss out on the Fun and being apart of the future number 1 game on steam.

The game in its current state is a solid foundation on which to build upon. It already has almost as much to do as DayZ and the basic crafting options presented are already pretty extensive. The game is also in my opinion infinitely more stable than other survival games out there I have had absolutely no crashes in the 8 hours I played yesterday. The team have obviously put a lot of effort into this game and are clearly fans of the genre	 they have taken working concepts and mechanics from similar games and trimmed the garbage away then implanted them into one super baby. The metabolism tab is a little daunting when you first click onto it	 however once you begin eating and drinking in game the basics of understanding your prisoners nutrition become clear without any hand holding. The puppets or “zombies” in game are solid and in their current state work perfectly. No clipping through walls	 no lagging etc	 etc. The highlight of scum as it is right now is looting the military bases and airfields. What was once in other titles a pvp hot zone with high risk high reward elements has now become a semi co-operative venture where you and other players avoid hulking almost indestructible mechs all the while searching for the coveted military gear and weapons	 while trying to maintain your shaky alliance with the other orange clad goon skulking about the aircraft hangars. As it stands scum is an interesting twist on an already established genre and with future updates looks to become a very promising and entertaining title."

Afterwards taking a dump and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the corpse.Cons - Can't change gender- Can't change height- Only so many faces to choose from in the menu- Zombies have waayyyyy to much health u can prob put around 5 bullets into one before it dies - Not to many things that u can do in singleplayer currently that differ from multiplayer	 singleplayer currently is more used for trying to learn the game then anything	 I would recommend they add something to diversify it like maybe a small story or certain quests u can get from a.i or something to bump up fame points and get new loot or something that would seem kinda cool.- Kinda buggy but it is in early access so wtf do you expect.Not to many BIG flaws and I can definitley say that these devs are one of the best devs that I have seen in my life	 they listen to the community and do what the community wants and are also very responsive. This game is one of the best early access games that I've ever played and would definitley recommend buying it and can't wait till full release. Don't listen to people saying it has poor optimization because they aren't running at 400 fps I play under the system requirements and I play just fine I get around 40 fps usually but I can go down to 18 in certain areas but I also have a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cpu. If u have an i5 and over with a decent video card you can prob run this game 70+ fps medium settings. P.S this is one of those games where 30fps feels like your getting 60."

If you are a fan of DayZ of Rust this game is for you. Pros-Metabolism	 disease	 and crafting work very well and manage to be complex but fun and rewarding.- Scavenging and looting is also equally complex and fun with puppets (zombies) and sentry mechs patroling town and high tier loot areas. -Melee is the best out of any survival game. Nothing comes closeCons-Pvp needs some work. Shooting isn't as polished as it needs to be. Guns need to be louder	 sound better. - I get 60-80 fps when the server restarts but as time goes on my frames drop to 25-30. I also am playing on a potato pc so I can't complain about that"

If you are looking to support a new survival game I think the 20 is worth is. it's solo-able in that I don't feel like I require a team to have fun and and be formidable. Content in terms of survival is pretty solid	 especially concerning food & water needs	 crafting and construction feels like it has a ways to go but I'm liking it so far. learning curve is a bit steep but not too bad	 watched a few videos and got a grip within two hours of play"

Survival is key	 it is definetly a survival game first and foremost	 but zombies	 mechanical sentries	 as well as other players help kick you while you're down. So far I am very impressed with devs as patches have been coming almost daily and they are focused on gameplay issues	 not adding outhouses or other silly things while dragging us along promising a next major update or porting to console. There have been enough updates in the week I have owned the game to restore my faith in the early access program and happy thus far with my leap of faith. That said	 it is still early access so bugs are there but nothing game breaking and optimaztion still needs to happen but again	 I can play it on my laptop so it's not that bad. The single player mode is just as fun as the multiplayer if you want to explore without harrassment from other players or if you're like me and have kids and may need to pause the game from time to time until they're asleep	 then you can seemlessly take your honed skills to the servers	 loot	 gear up	 and drop some bodies with your friends or just as easily solo. Thumbs up ladies and gents. It's a great survival game	 finally."

Before you start crying Early Access(They named Early Access after EA	 you know the company that keeps ripping you off)	 keep in mind that yes I understand what EA is and the exscuse babies like to throw onto unfinished games. But in all honesty there is no content. Survival is a chore and a bore. And at the end of the day this is a DayZ mod which DayZ started out as a mod. In reality it isn't connected to DayZ except by gameplay which it actually is a downgrade from. Now back onto the devolopers and EA games since that's all the gameplay that is in the game. One thing people have to realise with EA games is that the devolopers aren't hurting for money. This is a way for them to make bonus profits while the game is being devoloped. A major misconeption about EA games is that the dev team is struggling to put food on the table so it's ok to rip off gamers. But in reality they're doing just fine and this is extra money to throw onto another project early the same as Space Engineers or Reign of Kings. Are their good EA games? Sure! But if the new market today is how finished is your game on release which most of the time it isn't. Why support a game that's been in devolopment for years and is so far behind DayZ that.... why don't you play DayZ? If you find the lack of features inviting and the lack of any actualy pvp outside of a zombie running at you that all you have to do is strafe and hit with a rake. Then this is the game for you."

Yes	 there were server issues but unlike other games	 they rolled out patches that actually worked and updated in minutes. They remained communicative on their social media platforms throughout it all.Don’t expect everything you’ve seen on the dev diary videos to be active.

Honestly this game has the most potential at its birth than most any game that’s gotten popular in recent years. I can’t wait to see where they take itFind a server. Join server. Spawn  in an open world after creating your character. You need Fame Points to play multiplayer matches (Tab). You get a lot of fame points by killing NPCs. Think of fame points as a currency.

Low FPS (on low settings)	 falling through the textures to death and other technical bugs aside I can say - it just isn't fun.The idea of this game is to overcomplicate. Everything. Every action in this game has to be as tedious and counterintuitive as possible. When I first saw the promos for this game I've said - ""the game will not work with this amount of complications and mechanics"". I really hoped they would find a reasonable level of realism and fun. They didn't.Every action in this game takes a lot of time and playing around with the clunky UI. Your basic experience will be like this: you run around an empty forest	 occasionally stumble upon a military base	 slowly loot 90% of the stuff you can't even use (like guns with no clips or guns with no ammo)	 drop your weapon when using anything because it won't fit into your inventory any more	 drop the useless stuff	 pick up your weapon back	 starve	 try to eat	 see that your energy is not regenerating	 run	 take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ run out of stamina	 take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ try to eat more	 vomit	 energy is still not regenerating...

Stats on calorie consumption and oxygen in my blood? Is this a fun game? Do the devs know what fun is? It's like playing a racing game as a guy who works at car service near the gas station where the races are done.

I have stealth’d in and was confident until I got pinched. My heart is racing and I’m watching the mech patrol pattern to time my escape. I have a 9mm pistol with 3 bullets and no magazine. The Mech suddenly turns to me and I hear an audible “Halt prisoner! Leave this area immediately!” And begins to open fire. This is it. I’m dead. I actually wince at my computer as the bullets fly past me and tear into the duo that opened the warehouse door behind me. They both are immediately dispatched. I wait until the mech finishes his patrol and turns around to pace the other direction. I creep into the warehouse and close the door. I loot their corpses and now have more gear than I can carry. I take their own tactical knife and chop up their corpses. Today was a good day. *actual results may vary

Towns rarely ever have anything you need	 find a gun but you still need to find mag for said gun. They just try too hard to make it an extreme survival game which is dumb. It's a game	 I don't want to play Real Life while playing a game. Seems no matter how much you eat or drink energy won't regen. Fighting is terrible	 fighting zombies by hand is pointless	 and even fighting with guns up close is pointless. Best to not even let the zombies get in close or else you're screwed pretty much or just run away. The Auto Lock on while fighting is the dumbest game design ever. Because if you try to run away takes 3-4 secs before the auto lock goes off after you try disabling it	 so in that time zombies hit you another 4 or 5 times. And when you try to fight other human players hahahah people teleport all over	 takes too many hits with melee weapons. The game is just really really bad	 so save your money and stay away. This game is worst than DayZ and PUBG combined."

The best way to quickly sum up this game is basically all the great features of any survival game that you can possibly think of kind of worked together into one	 but also has its own unique twist. The amount of realism in this game is kind of insane considering it is a video game! You can become Vitamin D deficient if you don't get enough sun! If you don't balance your diet properly you will become un-healthy and either gain or lose weight. This game has an incredible amount of potential! I would love to see Base Building implemented at some point	 also more guns and attachments would be great as well. Even with only 15.8 hours played and 1000's of hours on other survival games I can confidently say SCUM is the best of the best! And will be so much better when more and more features are released!"

513710	0	0	dreaMMerchant85	20	1	1	65.7	September 4	 201	"First off	 SCUM is a great game with even GREATER potential. The devs did a great job adding the best things from other sandbox survival games without making SCUM ""too messy"". I have about 50 hours now	 and like most people in the beginning	 died numerous times to numerous PvE elements. But after about 2 hours of continual play I was able to establish a foothold on my server. I just wanted to take the time to post my own PROS/CONS/SUGGESTIONS to the devs AND community to hopefully get an idea of what we could expect from this game.I also just want to say that because of the uniqueness of the character management that I think that in the next few months this game could be either the BIGGEST sandbox survival game ever OR take a HUGE nosedive into the nether-regions alongside DayZ and other ""great"" titles.So FIRST  I'll actually start with the CONS/""Things to fix"":- Once you figure out how to scavenge and get into a military base	 the PvE elements are relatively easy. I feel like there's no ""mid game"" yet. Once you raid a base successfully	 you can do it the same way every time with little to no risk regardless of the giant mech that's capable of shooting 50mm rounds at you. (Raise dmg on Mechs)- Maybe because of the Early Access stage	 but I don't feel like there's any difference in creating a fat♥♥♥♥♥ intelligent guy and a muscular ""high school jock"". - The sentries glitch a lot in NUMEROUS ways i.e. getting stuck in the ground	 not de-aggroing	 and their line of sight is sometimes a little wonky as you can be completely conceiled behind something or in a complete different room and you take an aggro.- Aiming has a weird feel to it	 maybe I'm just expecting PubG aiming	 but ADS is just a little off with certain DPI settings.- My in game voice chat doesn't work	 I know it does for other people	 but maybe those that read this can add to comments that theirs doesn't work either	 if not. - Going prone behind certain objects in tight areas can be problematic as your character can ""get stuck"" and start to take random world impact damage.- You can hit zombies through walls- Still some lagginess when entering new areas and getting into larger fights (mostly PvE when there's 10+ zombies and sentries shooting down on you and you're trying to sprint away)Now the PROS (also with suggestions):- The fact that when you first tab your menu and go to your metabolism is actually intimidating	 IS GREAT! I love the dynamic system of having to watch not just carb intake but your calories	 carbs	 vitamins	 and the numerous other meters you have to pay attention to.- The feeling when you start to ""get it"" is pretty rewarding. Theres nothing like dropping in and figuring out how to craft things and getting that first kill on an animal. (Now if you can only figure out how to make a fire...LuL)- Raiding the various POIs and military bases is fun as hell! (This also adds to the whole begining/mid/late game arguement made. You can literally have just your prison suit on and go from 0 to hero if you know how to get into a base.- The different biomes/terrains are awesome	 the weather is dynamic and the day/night transitions are perfect. You can actually night raid in the early evening and it still be night by the time you're done.General overview:I feel like the game was built for the ""hardcore sandboxers"" but again	 no mid game means that once you figure a few things out	 its off to the races. I know that adding easier elements for the ""not so hardcore"" survivalist means the game itself with bring more revenue	 but that's the thin line that I think the devs are deciding to either cross	 or not. We'll see I guess. For now though	 the game is fun	 rewarding	 and can be somewhat challenging in certain situations. As of right now I'd only recommend the game to fans of the genre or a newbie with a friend that already plays the game.Lastly	 Id like to give a big shout out to the devs who work on this game and its updates CONSTANTLY. It's refreshing to log on to see patches almost twice weekly and not some ""big quarterly patch"". I look forward to see where things go and I'm optimistic that this game will go in the right direction."

My reasoning for this is the current state of the game. While I AM having a decent amount of fun the server performance	 game performance and lack of any tutorial is a real turn off. It's difficult to recommend to anyone other than people who are ""used to"" early access survival titles. Especially complex ones	 as there is literally a ton of stats and shenanigans going with with zero guide or explanation or even a little tooltip in most cases.The performance issues are my main current bug bear. With an i7 5820k hex core and 1080ti	 I should be expecting little to no issues	 certainly on low settings. Unfortunately there must be either server issues or a memory leak as the game gradually dropped down to mid 20s by the end of a stream of the game. Restarting it and not streaming	 low settings netted me 50 to 80fps in a wooded area with one or two houses. Not the best but not the worst I guess	 but a pain to stream it. Performance seems to vary between people by a large margin and hardware setups and settings.All being said	 I hope they get things together as the game itself seems pretty decent. DayZ like for sure	 but doing a few of its own things. The mechs in the high loot areas for example are a highlight!EDIT: Bugs getting me killed. FP is like a currency	 the more times you die the less fun you have as you have NO ♥♥♥♥ING CHOICE to LOSE points....into the negatives	 then be penilised if you die again lmaoEDIT: No anti cheat....really?

It's actually the best I've played so far and the game is like 10% finished lol.Insane graphics ( needs strong cfg if you want to run in epic : I have i5 6700k +16Go DDR4 + 1060gtx + EVO drive m.2 )You get the usuals problems like desync but it will be fixed I'm sure ! ( I HOPE )Also craft is clunky but it will improve !

Couldn't even connect to any servers. Really ashamed as I was so excited to play this.

The game even includes fun little mini games inside such as Team Deathmatches that pull you from where you were to a specific place on the map where you pick your weapons and fight players to come out on top and after its done drops you right back where you were with your gear.Reminds me alot of Arma 2 Dayz. Only complaints so far would be the small selections of weapons	 The map is 12km x 12km which is absolutely huge to have to march across but the map is beautiful which makes it a lot less of a pain for the time being. Ive been in servers before where ive killed people and then the server has a hiccup that reverts us back to before the combat started so now theyre expecting me which is a sad thing to happen but im sure whatever the reason for it may be theyre working on it.I have alot of high hope for this game so far even though its very early on. i cant wait to see what the Devs do with this"

Servers are constantly crashing	 there is little to no loot even after searching for hours (Unless you go to a military base	 the loot in normal towns is all trash)	 you can have a full server and never see anyone	 after 5 hours on the server running around	 my 2 friends and I only saw one guy and fought him and there are no vehicles so it's an annoying running simulator with some good landscapes at times.

This demonstrates very poor design	 forethought	 and perhaps a fundamental lack of experience with online games from a player persepctive.  To make matters worse	 the server admins have no ability to ban	 kick	 or even track users.  There are no server admin tools at all.  Furthermore	 users cannot host their own servers	 even locally.  Talented server admins could manage to whip up some rudimentary tools to help limit the cheaters	 but instead they want to force players to use some hosting company for an outrageous fee.  I couldn't even play for an hour without the entire server repeatedly being simultaneously killed by cheaters.  For now	 consider this as a single player game... and not a good one."

If you arent ready to deal with very poor performance(often sub 50fps on 1080)	 desync that nearly makes the game unplayable	 excessive hacking	 game breaking bugs	 and many unfinished features then i wouldnt reccomend this game. Its in a very rough state.Id say 90% of my time was spent trying to meet up with my friends. 4hrs on a nearly full server and we came across 1 person....hop servers to another high pop and spend 2hr trying to group up. Then we finally do get in a groove	 raid a city get pretty geared....then my buddy gets killed by a zombie clipping through a wall....other buddy get 1 tapped by a robot while trying to move away from clipping zombie. I finally die when (after being in building for 30min) 20 zombies appear out of nowhere and run out of room next to me. We stopped playing at that point and prolly wont return until a few updates pass.Great concept	 if done right will be what DayZ dreamed of being.

The environment is emersive enough that I don't feel bad walking and running around	 hunting some deer with my friends and hanging out in the woods.

The loot in the military zone feels rewarding on servers with 20 something players as well	 with 64 players there just doesn't seem to be enough loot unless you join right after a server restart. The melee mechanics aren't bad as well. I can definitely see some people throwing down in the ring or something for loot on some of the more roleplayish servers if those ever become a thing	 or even just with normal people. So yeah... There's a lot of room for growth and the dev has big plans so it's definitely worth pitching in 20 bucks to see how far we can take this game. Ooone bad thing however is...

Zombies can just faze through walls	 not to begin with the mechs that patroll military bases. These mechs can see see you in a silo without windows and the doors closed just to shoot jou down through a wall or door when you think you are save. With the amount of work thats done to gather resources and weapons so you are comfortable with breaking in a millitary base and fight other players it is just cruel to be robbed of all your efforts like that. I would stil recomend the game because its just a lot of fun to play and considering what is already in the game i cant wait to find out what the developers have to offer in the future. However if you cant stand being killed and losing all your loot because of some annoying bugs or sometimes microstutter i would definetly wait for the game to be developed further."

Granted it has its flaws just like anyother EA game. First problem I have is that the FPS in game drops significantly after playing for an hour or two. This can be fixed by logging out and logging back in but who should have to do that ever hour or so? Other then the fps issue I haven't really experienced any major issues with the game. There is some lag on ceritan servers	 sometimes I will see animals and zeds lagging about making it really hard to kill them. I feel like this game has real potential	 and the devs take community input into consideration. If dayz and arma are your style games I would suggest getting it. There isnt much to the game right now. Its pretty much run around get geared up and go to the big player areas like the airfield to pvp. Personally I spent a good 20 hours just hiking around hunting animals and and crafting	 and I gotta say its really fun to try and survive in the wilderness. I can totally recommend this game to anyone who has a survival craving! I give this game a 7/10"

Has great potential but totally pointless right now because of the dsync/lag	 you get in a gun fight after looting for 2hrs an your shooting at a wizard .. some dude vanishing and re-apearing somewhere else its horrendous	 can you imagine how frustrating that is. Also alot of the mechanics are pointless right now e.g you dont have to cook meat etc you just chew raw meat with no consequence so on and so on.  I know its early access. If and when these problems get ironed out then ill change my review and it would be worth paying more than £15 if the price goes up for a polished game for sure an ill change my review	 but right now dont jump on the bandwagon and waste your money	 let them earn your coin"

This game shows a lot of effort and passion from the developers in the many patches since release and the transparency of the devs on YouTube and Reddit about the future of their game. Currently the bugs and issues are fixed before I even realise there was a problem	 and for a relatively new early-access game SCUM is far better than other games in the same genre that have had a much longer time for testing and fixing. Keep at it Devs	 this game is already a contender for one of the greats and will definitely outshine its competition when all your work has been implemented.

The graphics are stunning. Pretty much the good loot is protected by ""mechs"" and you have to try to get in there past zombies	 mechs and players. The zombies and mechs have amazing ai as well as the animals. The map is pretty big and quite fun to explore. I was shocked with an experience I had with an in-game deer. Just keep in mind not everything is completed and they are going to implement more. One thing to seal the deal for me is base building. However	 they are pushing patches like crazy and listening to the community! I have almost 40 hours and I would say I got more than my 20 bucks worth. I am enjoying it so far with my friends."

Graphics is nice	 playability is good and it has so much potential! If your like me and absolutely love survival games and like the grind with no easy spawn in and sprint and kill then this will suit you. Players who are experienced fps gamers or pubg fans may not like as much but this was never intended to focus on pvp. Once you understand what this game is about and appreciate it for a survival game it is great fun and possibly the best survival multiplayer game out there. For me i have not experienced any real bad fps	 bad server problems	 hackers	 or unplayable game issues	 imo as per usual they just need to focus on their fight on hackers	 bugs	 content and most important end game so to say	 once we all spent stupid amount of hours and feel like we explored all map and understand the game	 we like to go back to our bases/houses and chill	 bring back loot or go base raid	 this is always and will always be a fun part of survival games fighting other groups but also comes with bugs/exploits and issues so they hopefully will work towards keeping this playable in some sort of way. But the Devs have kept to their word with what they wanted to do with this game	 they do listen to the community and survival games in general do not attract massive audiences and eventually die down due to no good  updates/content	 bugs/hackers or devs given up	 survival genre games are a niche market	 keeping playability attractive can be hard and they need to keep on top of it	 people also don't like games that are to hard	 find anything to moan about for an easy life so i hope they don't give in	 I am not sure about the long term playability but i think the future is bright for this game and is worth the money	 support the dev’s	 enjoy the grind	 meet players and survive. 8.5/10  considering this game is new/early its great	 potential 9+/10.*best advice i could give is join a community	 this game like many with players and friends becomes much more funMy community is:https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/4/1737715419902443599/"

513710	2	1	backdoorbeauty	253	2	-1	53.3	September 3	 201	"The game itself is obviously lacking at the moment because it is still early access and the roadmap shows that will indeed be fleshed out so I have no qualms there. The actual content currently in place gives me faith they'll impliment the features listed in roadmap well and they seem to really listen to the consumer base. Despite all this I wouldn't recommend purely because it is primarily a multiplayer game and doesn't work on many levels as single only lacking threat of pvp or coop help and their in lies the problem.... server hosting. When I originally started following it some time ago it was stated we'd get to host our own servers. The devs seem to have changed direction on this and Gportal only is the current case. I have access to dedicated servers (far better and more capable than gportal ever will be) I'd like to host on but obviously we can't. Even if you are UK or Germany as most of my clan is those who aren't have even more issues.  Now gportal are not only severely overpriced esp if you already have a server solution	 they are shared hosting and oft load to overcapacity thus there is often problem and support can be a pain going on those I know who used them for other games. They seriously oversell and run at capacity thus I have always found their servers to be unreliable and laggy even for clients with no latency or routing issue and not so bad ping. Even if you rent a low slot server for a small group of friends who all have perfect ping you'll have issues with crappy servers still due to being shared hosting since it is on the same host with a load of other servers. Network issues is something which basically ruins this game and I suspect it'll impact they significantly if they stick with the Gportal only policy. I've had more issues in servers since launch than I have game bugs	 for a very early in release schedule EA that is worrying.I'll change my review should the devs change this but it is hard to recommend with the current server hosting state. I bought the supporter edition and don't wish to refund as hoping this will change and the devs consider this but sadly wont recommend until then. If you can live with the potential network issues it may be worth taking a gamble hopign they address this as roadmap looks promising."

It has zombies which are a threat along with mech (AI robots) which need to be stealthed to acquire decent end game loot. Inventory loot system is on par with pubg	 drag and drop items into persistent real world	 craft from proxity or backpack	 craft ammo on the move with tool boxes and finally (yes you can run and craft whilst maintaining field movement).The AI on the zombies and mech is actually very good. Path finding is excellent	 zombies can vault through house windows after you	 mech zombies can shoot you through window railings. Everything I'd expect a survival game to be a challenge and somewhat give moments of panic.I just _sincerely_ hope the devs do not cater to the moronic herd of the commoners (the high pop gimme a gun type plebs) and tone down their vision of this complicated and yet rewarding survival simulator for those of us with brain cells going the extra mile to learn the finer details of this gem.Once you get used to the mechanics	 this game is a blast. get yourself a good team	 boot the idiots and enjoy."

If DayZ and PUBG got a hotel room this would be the result.Saying all this	 the Graphics and framerate are the best ive seen in any game to date	 and it is one of the best early access games i've purchased and can't wait to see what the dev's add next.

In discord I'm yelling at my friend to hurry up and join in. Using my focus	 I hear the door	 four different footsteps	 and voices. Two walk in the front	 two walk in the back.

He slowly creeps up the stairs	 not realizing that I'm behind him the entire time. I fire. Shooting him in the back of the head. One more. ""Dude	 your friends are dead! just walk away!"" I hear footsteps outside. I run to the bedroom and look off the balcony to see the last survior leap the fence. I shoot	 I miss. He's gone."

The game is definitely playable and fun. No it doesn't have much for end game at the moment. Yes a few things need tweaking. Yes both of those things are expected for early access.

I like as you do things you build up fan and if you do die you have options to spawn in a ranndom location to even a squad mate. I love the concept of an accualy realistic suvival game. The devs also are coming out with updates very often which is very encouraging and are intouch with there community. Im still gicing this a thumbs up and a definite 5 star but my only thing right now with the understand its early access and they are working on it. I feel like becasue the map is so vast that there is ALOT of running. Becasue of the stamana it can take a long time to get from grid to grid. But with that said there are alot of elements in the game to still make it alot of fun!

Weapons are not super rare which is nice	 but they are guarded by AI Robots Death Machines that make it at least somewhat difficult to get to the guns	 avoid robot shots and zombies to get to them. The food/drink system is nice too	 eat too much and you'll be sick. You also have to manage your bowels. You decide when to pee and poop	 but leave it too long and your character will do it without your control - not something you want to happen during a fire fight	 trust me. The game does 3rd person exceptionally well too	 being able to toggle between 1st and 3rd person	 although while in 3rd person	 if your character cannot see them in 1st person	 you cant see them in 3rd	 so no more corner peeking and being prefired	 it's all ""if you can see them they can see you"" which would be great to see in more games that use 3rd person.TLDR: you can pee/poop	 no more 3rd person corner peeking	 is DayZ but made well.

Scum took best parts of suvival elements and put more detail to it. Surivival is main objective and you need to surivive before starting real pvp. Loot is enough if you know where to look. You need to feed yourself keep yourself hydrated and check your metabolism. You need to keep an eye on your bladder so you dont need to pee on a gun fight or watch what you consume if  you get diarrhea  on middle of a road that camper on  the hill can end your misery with a bullet. Maybe you are missing some vitamins go make yourself a vegetable soup like your mom. There is few features that makes Scum different from other survival games. For example Giant Robots called ''Mechs'' are guarding İmportant locations like bunkers-airfiled-trainyards- prison etc. But these locations give you more of a military gear. So it is high risk high reward. There is also a leaderboard system in every server based on Fame. Fame is basiccaly points you get from certain actions like crafting-killing people etc. With your fame you can spawn on your buddy or in your shelter. Also you can use your fame to joing death matches which will give you more if you win one. Map is also big but a bit empty. There is  also no big city on map and it is bad.Only problems I see is lack of content	 server lag and fps drops but ı believe they will fix it. It is another hope on another early access title but time will show."

I've been doing a decent amount of single player and maybe that's where my issues are. Guns are hard to find	 they draw attention of zombies like mad and the landscape is sparse when it comes to looting.  you can spend an hour looting a town	 and walk way with maybe a pistol 20 candles and some other stuff.  This needs some more guns and ammo laying about I fear.. maybe handguns / shotguns around town	 and bunkers have more military style guns hanging out.  The requirements to make a big backpck	 or a fire etc are quite high for the limited carrying space you need	 there's many different ammo types and sometimes you find 7.62 in a house with a pistol	 which is a bit disconserting.  you may search for 2 hours and find a pistol 20 rounds and a clip for it.  Sure you can go into a base guarded by robots	 getting in sneaking usually is okay but getting out is a whole other story.

513710	2	1	Epicepson	69	4	-1	1.7	August 31	 201	"The game is similar to many of the typical survival-style games	 such as DayZ. It's a shame that there's very little variation in games within this genre. The game's lack of customization is reflective of how the game has only been released for three days (although this was one of the most important features I was looking for within it	 feeling a little misled by the Devs considering how pitiful the customization options are in it's current state). Furthermore	 the game has no anti-cheat system	 and is riddled with cheaters who ruin the already unsatisfactory game experience. The UI is cluttered	 and while it is a good concept	 it still throws a ton of information immediately in the user's face without giving them an opportunity to understand how it works. In addition to this	 it is incredibly difficult to join a server with another person as there is no option to search for a server name	 nor join via the Steam client. Issues like this make the game feel rushed and as of right now	 we have very little knowledge on how much time the developers are going to invest in this game and whether or not they will listen and address the issues their player-base has found. The price could potentially increase in the future	 although ""value for money"" is one of the major factors this game currently has going for it right now	 and I pray it doesn't increase with the future content that will be added over time. In the future	 if this game is able to respond and deal with said issues appropriately	 I would consider repurchasing the game. However	 in it's current state	 I do not believe this game is very different at all to any other survival game	 and I don't want to delve deep into the survival game cycle that I have previously fallen into before.0/10 - Best game i've ever played."

I mainly play Escape from Tarkov nowadays and never jumped on the dayz train but have really wanted to play something similar with voip	 active devs and interesting gameplay. I absolutely love this game...not as much as Tarkov but this is a perfect supplement for my tarkov off days. Instead of speaking about the actual gameplay which I'm sure you've probably done your own research and read other reveiws I'll take a moment to talk about my performance on my relatively old rig.

First couple hours I played at epic graphic settings and had some microstutters here and there but not really anything game breaking...i went ahead and went to preset medium graphics and then maxed out the draw distance	 lowered shadow quality and upped texture by 1. Running good for me now. I dont have an exact fps because instead of relying on a number I wanted to just play and see how it works for me. It runs fine. People complain about performance with 1080's which had me worried but I'm not a graphics♥♥♥♥♥♥ just like decent playable framerates and even with my somewhat old rig its working just fine for me. I'll update my reveiw if my personal experience changes but for now I wholeheartedly can say this game is a blast and a wonderful first experience for a realistic survival game. Tarkov gunplay is by far the best of any game I've ever played and still my favorite but the option of gameplay style and depth of survival mechanics leave me feeling very excited about the future of Scum.

Which means the game is incomplete so they will be adding or taking away features in the game. With that being said I went ahead a purchased this game. I was a bit skeptical on buying it because of what I saw on twitch. What I mean by that is the servers for multiplayer are not working that well and the game doesn't run smooth after awhile of playing it so you have to logout and log back in all the time. Besides that for early access I think this game has a lot of potential and has a lot of great features in it already. If you buy it I hope you enjoy!

Crafting (0/5)- Worst interface for crafting I have ever expierenced.- No Drag&Drop; e.g. you need to select the campfire and your lighter to make fire. Its not possible to drag the lighter on the campfire. You cant drag items out of cupbords e.g...same thing --> right click on item and ""drop"".- The crafting system has not given entire access yet and it feels horrible to me and accrding to other games.3. PvPvE (-1/5)- Ok	 I know it's EA	 but common...enemies	 zombies and wildlife is glitching around like♥♥♥♥♥♥..I cannot even fight them	 cuz they seem to teleport. --> I have a good ping (around 29 on that server and an high end PC)- So I cannot even say if it is good or not. But this should be one of the basics of EA titles.4. Graphics and other parts of the game (1/5)-Graphics and landscape are beautiful but the servers are unstable as hell. At first u don't rly know that the server has gone down and your going ahead with crafting/looting/fighting... whatever. After u got dc'ed you can experience a wonderful rollback like 5 minutes. Conclusion ( 1/5) Cool idea and atmosphere but thats pretty much it. I can't really test things in that Early Access	 cuz every important part is not working. Servers are horrobile unstable like the whole game. Today an update occured and steam told me that the datafile was locked by the devs	 so my game pretty much stuck and i can't play it.That is way too much effort for an EA title for me (and i tested so far ARK	 miscreated	 pubg and some others). I will not recommend this. Wait until it's released.-->never again EA"

The game isn't ""a copy""	 due to how if it was a ""copy"" itd be like games you enjoy	 which are most likely based off other games.  Also	 an open world survival game	 while it has some bad games	 does not make a new one automatically bad.  The walking sim aspect is actually quite small and finding people isn't that hard.  It's obnoxious to see people bashing a game that is attempting to have interesting mechanics badly due to games in the past.  DayZ standalone was a single game which had a bad development team	 but that doesn't mean this game is bad.  Now don't get me wrong	 I'm not one who uses the excuse of ""an early access game means you can't give it criticism"" but I believe bashing on it	 without playing the game and based only on pass experiences is an extremely ignorant thing to do.Moral of the story	 play the damn game	 its 20 dollars and enjoy what is there based on ITS gameplay	 not previous failed games...It's fun for the price	 and impressive for an Early Access survival game."

We get there about thirty minutes later of running and walking along the way we looted a few houses and we got ot talk about what we'd do if one of us died so we get there	 me thinking there is only one entrance I run directly through the front gate a mech spots me but before it can shot I run into a small building and close the door tell my friends to look for another route they succesfully found one I was still in the building.  So after sitting in the building for a good five minutes learning the mech pattern I notice some stairs and hatch a plan once the mech turns away I was gonna run for it	 I end up running outside and make it I am on the top floor of the main warehouse now	 there wasn't much loot so I try to get down a near ladder me being stupid I though I could jump off the ladde onto one of the lower floors but instead of hitting one of the other floors I miss falling many floors down both my legs hit and shatter I somehow survived at sixteen health I panicked and bandage hoping to survive and I luckily did.  After that ordeal was able to regroup with friends i've looted and had my share but I get greedy	 so I go back to the warehouse I get to the top floor then I hear a loud bang ""i've been shot"" I pull out my shotgun and me the enemy engage in a firefight for about thirty seconds	 he ended up besting me.  thankfully I had 125 fame so I respawned on a squad mate and RUSHED into the factory making my way building to building avoiding mechs	 I end up meeting with my squad mates all upstairs they couldn't seem to find the enemy player so I go upstairs and see my dead body it was untouched so I loot up get my gear back and go searching around I find him	 but he was afk so I sat aimed at him for a moment he comes back panics tries to shoot but I was quicker to the draw and revenge was mine we successfully escaped after that.  THAT is my scum story."

(obviously this is just my opinion) I liked DayZ (closest similar game) but the game is janky and the graphics aren't as good as this game. SCUM adds a layer of ""fun"" to open world survival	 you don't have to grind for hours when you are new to the game just to be able to find your friends (I prefer this) This does however not take away from the survival asepcts of the game. People will bash this game for adding features such as names above teammates heads	 and having a map that shows your location	 but to be honest I don't wanna spend 80 years meeting up with buddies to just die. Pros- Grahpically good- FUN- Not too grindy- Easy to learn but difficult to master- devs appear to care - The priceCons- could use optimisation- Desync in it's current state can be kinda bad- Could use more weapons and things (that will come in the future i'm sure)"

It's laggy	 buggy and lacks a lot of features in both character customization and gameplay but the Z's DON'T run through walls even at release LOL. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet as I saw it best to try it out in SP first. I hear people complain a lot about MP not working but this review is about game mechanics and my SP experience only. I think the price is fair and it's pretty damn cose to a great EA experience compared to all the garbage that's published on steam for money grabs these days.

The gunplay is realistic and things like musclemass will make an difference in recoil for an example.You can make your character different in many ways. For an example you can make an melee build that has alot of melee damage and less stamina loss for an example. Or you can make an sniper build.The game is realistic.

The biggest thing that sets this game apart from the others in this saturated open-world survival genre is the metabolism system. The game requires you to have a balanced diet to remain healthy. Beyond this	 SCUM is your standard open-world survival game. The game does not explain anything or guide you to what you are suppose to do. Combat and crafting isn’t anything special or noteworthy. At this time	 there doesn’t appear to be any base building.For a game that just released and is in very Early Access	 it seems to run reasonably well and looks as if it may have potential. Personally	 I got bored soloing after a few hours	 but playing with friends made the game more enjoyable. At this time it's ""okay"" (3 out of 5 stars) and hopefully the Devs have something special planned as it evolves. If you're a fan of DayZ Standalone	 I recommend it.

Multiplayer is unstable for alot of people (even was for me) but I do not have those issues and it works fine. The performance is not very good though and needs some work. But because it is early access and was just released	 I expect these issues to get fixed. The devs seem really focused on delivering a game that the community want to play and listen to feedback. The community also seems friendly which is rare in these kinds of games. It has some amazing potential and is a better DayZ for half the cost."

Over the short time I've been playing me and my friend have beat a guy to death with a sledge hammer and been shot at by players	 robots	 and attacked by zombies. I really enjoy the game so far and for $19.99 it is one of the cheaper games on the steam market. It's a shame to see players who are already bashing the game because of it's current state. It obviously should not be perfect and for an Early Access game it's honestly pretty damn good. While I admit both desync and hacking have affected my gameplay experience in the short time I've played the developers have both acknowledged and understood that these two things are present in the game. It's clear to me the Developers really care about their game and are willing to listen to the community's feedback. To summarize I think SCUM is a great game considering its Early Acess state. While I'd love to see more in the future. I believe for now the most important thing the Devs can do from here is work on fixing the desync	 which makes players appear to be teleporting more so than walking. As well as hacking which I know they are already working on."

It's just the desync and netcode (and poor optimization	 too) holding it back. It's nearly impossible to PVP because of how players teleport around. The way they make peaking fair (players are invisible if your char can't directly see them) is a nice mechanic but definitely needs some work	 because as soon as your char loses sight	 the player is instantly gone again	 and desync can cause them to still see you for example. Also	 this game obviously has ""the usual"" kind-of game breaking survival aspects.Lack of food spawns SOMETIMES (you either find a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of food	 or you find none)Full-gear players camping high-loot areas	 shooting nakeds on sightWay too OP puppets (zombies)	 nearly unbeatable with your fistsI love this game.

Because it's lame. The only catch this game is offering is the metabolism system and besides that	 nothing new.I really can't come up with anything good this game could offer. Arma/DayZ can offer you way more and they even have mods to enhance the similar gameplay. And yes	 you can compare those games to Scum	 because they are pretty much the same.Bad:- No vehicles- No building- No singleplayer story- Zombies catch you too easily- Big robot AI is a joke and military bases are too easy = lame- Melee combat is slow and doesn't feel good- Small selection guns. Only 11 different guns- There's no HUD showing your ammo when using a gun- Not enough ways to gather food	 like foraging or catching small animals- Inventory and Crafting UX- When replacing equipment	 you don't know what it's gonna replace- Tedious inventory organizing- Randomly dropping the item on your hand when looting- No achievements to strive for- Settings menu is really poor- Motion blur is on by default	 why?- When you get near enough to a town	 you get a big lag spike- Missing/placeholder animations on actions- No interesting landmarks and everything is very genericGood:- Good promotional videos- The game saves your progress well when you come back to a session- Metabolism system is interesting- Unreal engine- Steam refund policyThe early access is too early. They should've polished the game at least a year longer and bring more content to make it interesting to play. It's just a lame game with good and lacking ideas.For a good open world survival game	 Arma 3 or Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead. With mods	 they offer even more fun.For sole survival and story	 try The Long Dark.I recommend you wait and see how the game development goes. In it's current state	 it's really not worth your money and supporting early access."

Why is it bad that I don't have this vitamin? Why do I get diarrhea when I eat charcoal tablets? Why does nothing happen even if I'm at stage 4 starvation?

The game is very new and is very enjoyable to play	 however there are a few flaws.I would also like to note that the game is in EA which means that most of this will likely be fixed in the future- It takes FOREVER to cross the map	 cars or vehicles of some sort need to be implemented ASAP. This can be fixed by getting a good spawn	 but that costs fame points- Players being shown moving differently than what they actually are and teleportation	 it makes it hard to pvp sometimes.- Airfield needs to become balanced or buff the towns	 there is essentially no point of going anywhere except for military compounds since all towns practically have are foodThese are the only complaints I have and so far I have had a TON of fun playing this game solo and with friends.

Not only do you have to worry about getting killed from other players but they have these PVE mechs that guard all thegood  loot. These mech need to be removed from the game  as they have no real point other than to kill you and make you walk another hour and hope to not get killed by players or mech at another loot spot.  Again the mechs are the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanic  I've ever dealt with. They spot you thru building and one shot you which basically waste the last hour or two of play time. Then you have players camping the loot grounds and wait for the mechs to spot you and pin you down and they come in and kill you. Another goofy game mechanic is this flying camera thing that the only purpose is to give away your position to other players...This thing shows up every 30 to 1hour and you get no warning that is aabout to show up. So if you are looking to be sneaky or hang out in a sniper position..forget it. Additionally	  if you are looking for a survival game	 this isn't it as everything survival in it is broken. You can eat 4 steaks and drink 3-4 times and one minute later it tells you that you're hungry...You can have all your mineral stats over 1000% and the game will say you have a vitamin defficiency... This is nothing more than a cash grab. On a positive note: the game looks reall good with the unreal engine. Their is a lot of potential but looking at the history of just about every early access game they all flopped because once the devs made their money they disappear or randomly push small useless updates to make it look like they are active in deveoplment . More oftern than those updates break the game (h1z1..just survive). The last update this game did killed everyones fps by 30-40 percent. Oh	 well	 this was suppose to be my positive paragraph... As you can see this game has a very very long way to go.  I really hope the scum team can get it together and make an awsome game."

If you loved hardcore survival games like DayZ	 7 Days To Die etc then your going to feel right at home in here. I am more a pve hardcore player but found myself with friends having such a good time in the pvp server. Even in its current state its excellent. The in game features are above and beyond what you get in any other survival game and are only going to expand. It's not perfect at all but its Early access and thats to be expected. It needs better optimisation but the Devs are to on it and have already done alot on week one to address issues. The back story is also great as your on a reality show like the old movie The Running Man. I don't myself have the lastest computer but have been running this fine. But it does have issues that they are looking into so I like many have had frame drops which you have to log out and in to correct atm. Overall an amazing experience and already had some unforgettable times with mates in stitches laughing at things going on in this game. So great solo or with friends. But I do recommend with a friend as this  is a great team game and so much fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ohh and the supporters pack not only are you supporting the hard working Devs but what they give you for it makes it well worth your extra cash and they say more will be added in the future."

If you're bored and have 20 bucks to waste then go for it I guess... Otherwise wait for the community to ♥♥♥♥♥ some sense into the Devs.

Additionally	 my friends all play this game without the issues that I am having. I am running a 1060 6gb and an i5 6600k and this game is unplayable. My fps is absolute trash and the stuttering is awful	 even with my game settings on low. After I start my game (i had no issues during character creation) is when the issues start. After a few minutes the game just crashes with a ""GPU fatal error"". I have tried researching this issue and I cannot find anything about how to fix it. Also	 there are no servers that show up in the server list. This is most likely because the servers are down but I thought I would mention it anyway. If a fix for my issue comes out I will change my review but as of now	 my game is completely unplayable."

If you dont know what that means i will explain to you: It means that two relatively small dev teams from Croatia spend huge amonut of time and money just to get the game to this state. Game looks amazing	: houses	 gardens	 small villages 	 forests	 sea towns	 rivers	 mah just everthing is so realistic and beautiful.  If you expect that you will play classic shooter  :get lost. This is the game where you take 2-3 friends with you	 and you just walk and explore. This game has so much potential and can develop in every way they want. And that is amazing. For me	 the game setting reminds me of MGS: Snake eater.Especially when i was walking around in forest	 i was just waiting to get jumped by good old sniper aka The End. :D . Huge plus of this game are in game robots. I want to see more of then	 in forms like mini battle bots or some kind of flying drones with guns.  It will be fun to have randon enemy Ai patrols that are roaming on the map	 or high-tech highly secured places. I dont want to be rude	 but i had enough of zombies; but also	 dont get me wrong	  they are still fun. I think this game jem are machines. For now crafting has only basic stuff but im sure they will just adding more and more stuff and thats exciting.And also 	 for now	 we dont have any vehicles. In this state	 for me	 game is more than fine. Yea 	 the game needs more optimization	 servers stability and so on	 but like i said	 the game has just entered early access stage. I feel positive beacuse i know the dev team is good. Thumbs up!"

513710	2	0	tazhar	94	1	1	55.3	August 30	 201	"Honest opinion from an honest gamer! Be advised	 I've played the game for 10.4 hours! Okay	 so I've never really taken the time to review a game on Steam before	 but after reading some of the reviews on here	 I feel I need to defend this game somewhat. So to get started	 as we all know SCUM is in it's very	 VERY early Alpha stages. The developers warn of performance issues	 optimization issues	 content issue and so forth	 and for that reason I can't condone people negatively reviewing the game based on that alone. It's in Alpha - you were warned.That being said	 I have personally only received minor performance hits whilst playing SCUM on my own public rented server	 these included a few jolty lag spikes	 server crashes and one blue screen. During the release period	 the devs updated the game twice - rectifying these issues and thereon out	 the lag was a lot less disruptive and the game overall played very nicely considering it's short period of release. FYI I'm running a 1080 with 6850k i7 and 16GB ram. A few friends of mine had PC's less equip	 and also experienced similar performance	 so the ""streamer rig"" reviews aren't 100% accurate unless you quite literally are plugging your mouse and keyboard into a large	 spotty potato	 it's 2018 man	 come on!To move more into the actual depth of the game	 considering it's release period the game has a decent amount of content. Loot is mixed	 you either search a town and find only the essentials	 or you find too much to carry. I ran the airfield twice and ended up with three heavy firearms	 two sidearms	 a bundle of ammunition	 bulletproof vests & helmets	 a backpack	 military clothing and various utilities. The loot for me	 is well balanced.The survival aspect of the game is excellent. The depth of the character metabolism screen is something I've never seen before and it actually works! I've experienced no bugs with the game's core features whilst playing and nothing has happened that has made me regret playing in Alpha stages (yet). As an ex-DayZ SA player (for obvious reasons) this game has really scratched the survival itch for me. The zombies are exactly what we would expect and move / behave well. The robots at the airfield really aren't that hard currently as I managed to avoid them several times at the airfield and a few secure locations around the map - they require some stealth however. I won't divulge too much as I haven't got a lot of time. But as an overall point	 if you don't mind a few 'Alpha Hiccups' then this game is already fantastic. It's an excellent survival game with great PvE / PvP aspects and I'm not regretting my purchase one bit! For previous DayZ players	 THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! And for everyone else	 I'm sure you'll love it. Let's just hope the developers progress the game in the Alpha stages	 unlike another development company we're all aware of..**UPDATE**There's already been regular updates / patches and the game is consistently running a lot smoother. I'm really	 really enjoying this - the game mode events are a fantastic addition. I really have high hopes for the future of SCUM."

I gave it a look while on lunch and decided that for 20 bucks on release day	 sure why not.  Now	 under the full knowledge that:1) This game JUST released today2)I knew NOTHING about this game beforehand3)It's still in early access and when loading the game there is a warning stating so......I played this game for almost 8 hrs on release day and have to say that as long as the developers strive to continue to update/patch the game (to which I found MANY bugs) I think that this is going to be a VERY solid title in the survival genre.Are there bugs?  Of course there are	 it JUST released today.  I understand this.  Did I still get angry when I glitched through the map and lost 8 solid hours of gameplay?  Well hek ya I got upset	 I was just getting into a tough area and had somewhat decent gear.   Still doesn't change the fact that the game from the get go had my attention.  Solid graphics	 but it still needs some optimization.  Smooth	 and let me say that again	 SMOOTH controls.  I had literally 0 issues with controlling my character.    If someone I didn't know asked me	 ""How was the game?""  My answer?  For 20 bucks	 go get it	 give it a test spin and wait for the updates.  I can honestly say that I will be playing this game for quite a while (assuming that it will get somewhat timely updates/patches and that the developers listen to small guys like me) and that I would highly recommend it to my friends.   I know of at least 5 people that have purchased it that are just in my discord alone.Keep it up guys	 you have the foundation for something that could be quite the title and I am patiently waiting for the updates as they come out.

If this game keeps delivering and pushing out the updates and the content that it is capable of this could be the game of the year for survival gamers.

FPS.. on a 1080ti i7 8700k 16gb 3200 ram i currently get around 50 fps if im lucky. going into towns and larger places drops that to around 25-30 fps.2. stutters/freezes.. the game constantly stutters and freezes most of the time this only happens when entering towns or when a group of puppets/zombies appear but is still quite annoying3. Combat.. simply put the combat is bad	 very bad. whether its fighing hand to hand or with melee weapons its just clunky	 very slow and hits dont really pack the power it should even when you lay a pupper/zombie out.     The gunplay is even worse	 i say this but really against AI it isnt too bad apart from the stutters but for PVP its utterly atrocious	 players teleport	 lag and stutter all over the place making any form of player vs player combat unenjoyable at best and down right frustrating at worst.4. Loot. currently there are only a few places to get any decent loot/gear from in this game whether its the airfield or some of the other places sparsley dotted around the map. (thats if you fancy running for what seems like hours on end from place to place as the map size is on the large side. more on that next) the towns yield next to nothing	 your likely to come away from them with something that seems useful at the time only to find out upon researching that the small amout of items youve gathered are completely useless as their functions have not been added to the game yet.5. Map size. while the map is impressively large it is also very bland and points of interest are sparsely dotted around the map. getting to each POI takes a fair amout of time to the point where you wish there was an auto run feature so you can go away for 10 minutes at a time and come back and check if you've reached your destination yet. action is few and far between when travelling as it takes so long to traverse the map and with only 64 players on a server there is nothing but the occasional bear or zombie/puppet to worry about (I have only seen 1 bear in 12 hours of gameplay mind you) the map could do with scaling down or the player count should be greatly increased to double or more as there is zero tension when out in the wilderness of the map.6. Bugs. there are far too many to talk about in depth but i shall list a few i've come across so far.    Crafting bug	 unable to craft items i have all the materials for.    Hunger bug	 constantly being told im hungry even though my character would have eaten enough to feed a small village     Shooting bug	 being unable to shoot at all unless weapon is unequipped and equipped again    Memory Leak	 there is a clear memory leak that ruins FPS after an hour or so causing you to restart the game every so often just to get back th the 50 fps you were playing at before    Graphics bugs	 currently there is no difference in the highest settings in the game and the lowest (as far as i can see) neither setting helps improve the current state of the game and graphical issues    Mechs. Robots can sometimes see and shoot you through walls	 had many instances of robots shooting through walls and also spotting me through them too. though i do think the mech are a great concept they do need a lot of work in their current state.    Puppets. while most of the time they work well they are very much like the DayZ zombies where they are able to push themselves through walls	 not instantly though but say you run into a hanger and they are following	 you close the door and your safe	 so you start to go through all the loot only to turn around and watch 3 puppets clip through the walls and run directly to you while you scramble for the exit...    Weapons	 sometimes weapons in hand or in the inventory become invisible	 has caused me to lose 3 pistols so far.    Missing features. its an Early Access game so i cant complain too much here but there are a lot of useless things in the game right now that have features your unable to use as they have not been implemented yetit seems there are a few people not experiencing these issues with fps and bugs with different setups or are happy playing with lower fps than usual but i cannot speak for those people. i think there is a degree of luck with it at the moment. While i love the concept of the game and cant wait to see its future there is too much wrong with it right now. i will happily change this review in the future when the game is in a truly playable state. as a customer buying the supporter pack i hope it comes sooner rather than later."

My fame is second in the world while writing this review and im having a blast!!!!! please dont come in with the notion of pvp	 other players are in the game just to add a more realistic feel to the survival and give it another it factor i only run into a few players per session unless you go to airfield.  game is very in depth and has a learning curve but fun to learn also the roadmap and things that will be implemented seem like it will be a very full game"

I have not been dissapointed after 6-7hrs i felt i would leave abit of a review. The thought and attention to detail that has went into this game is mind blowing (no bullying doors is great). The map itself is beautiful and the atomsphere feels great! seeing a bear emeging from the mist charging towards you ...well i didnt have to select the poop option lets just say that.the survival aspect is extermly indepth ...count your carbs in-game aswell as real life ;) not to mention your continually changing stats depending on your behaviour in game.The combat so far has been fairly pleasing ...sledgehammers and zombies heads ...great combination.Sure there are some issues and bugs ...none that i have encountered could be claseed as game breaking but this should be expected with alpha games	 being honest id probably be dissaapointed if there were none but very impressed. The devs have been working very hard since release to fix any issues that do arise and hats off to them for the great job they are doing.No not all aspects of the game have been implemented there are skills and more still to be added by the looks of things but again alpha games ARE incomplete and theres no harm in dev videos showing all intended content and explaining how it wil work. I myself would rather stability over content....lack of content wont ruin your game but lack of stability will	 content can always be added later.Server settings are fairly minimal just now....this is great for easy setup but if you want more indepth settings you may need to wait.Regardless very impressed with the initial release would highly reccomend the game	 I look forward to playing more and seeing what else is yet to come"

I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's a perfect game	 by no means.  The game has it's flaws	 and is still in super early access.  Yet	 when you compare this game's flaws and issues with the issues of other games of it's caliber when they came out then you start to realize that these guys really care about their game and really care about the community they are producing.  Basically everything that you will see negative reviews about is being worked on tirelessly by these amazing guys who have brought this game to life for us.  They've released so many patches in the short time this game has been available	 and they have brought so many player suggested mechanics into this game.   They care about their community	 they care about their game	 and I for one care to give them what little support I can for being so passionate about what they do."

So much of this game's appeal comes down to taking the time to learn about all the little details. the metabolism mechanic was something I thought would be annoying but it feels more like a mini game and keeps some fun going between the long runs. Pretty bad play desyn right now which makes gunplay pretty terrible	 but it's just released a few days ago so I'm not too worried right now. I've been playing it mainly as a solo experience and right now	 I feel like that's the best way to learn it/play it without frustration.

Those are the general negative points you will find within most of the EA titles	 especially the survival ones I'd say. Are those the things that makes me leave this review? Well yes and no	 I'd argue that all those things makes the other aspects of the game worse	 but not deciding. The reason why I'm leaving this review here comes from salt	 I'm salty AF right now	 BUT according to me I am so for a reason. People say that this game is a better	 fully fleshed out DayZ? I fail to see so	 the only thing this game got going for it is the metabolism system	 which sounds cool on paper	 and look cool for the first couple of hours	 but in the end just feels pointless and adds tons of random♥♥♥♥♥♥that feels utterly boring imho. Lets talk stuff that is within a game like this	 and are major keys of it. First of;Gunplay - Its alright	 I can't bash it to much	 nor will i praise it. I think the handling of the guns is	 meh	 but it could be worse. It works is what I'm trying to say	 it does what its supposed to. Although the terrible netcode makes it awful at times	 but as said	 EA problems. Meele fighting - Interesting idea	 terrible execution. I like that they're trying to add a viable meele mode to this game unlike many other survival or well	 games not focused around fighting. Although at this state	 the terrible netcode	 the unbalanced damage on♥♥♥♥♥♥and the spammy nature of it makes it not fun at all. I just came from a fight	 where I hit a guy several times with a spear	 and with several times i mean like 20-30 times	 I threw a spear in his back	 hit him with my knife 15-20 times (Which was not a stone knife either it was a military grade knife)	 and with my fists countless times aswell. Meanwhile he was ONLY using his fists. I'd assume we both were att full health. I even got a headstart on hittign him like 6-7 times before he started fighting back	 yet	 I lost. Sure his character was more built around fighting	 but seriously? Not only were it stupid that he won that exchange	 but it was also an utterly boring fight	 like the fight itself was just a prolonged period of left clicking or holding right and strafing. He who won ever claimed in chat that it was pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. if someone find this combat fun	 I'm very interested in how. Well lets move on shall we. Eating and drinking -  Heres where a lot of the metabolism comes in	 I don't have to much to say on the topic at hand	 didn't find it adding anything nice here	 just more annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥ before y'all rant on well ♥♥♥♥ing casual I'll tell you why it only bugs me and don't add anything. Building - Most survival games have it	 so does this	 I'd say its mostly mediocre. With that being said	 I also think it does a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job of informing and helping you	 I've found myself stuck with having all materials I need and yet I can't craft it. Perhaps this is a ME problem	 aka being stupid	 or something is whack. Whatever it might be	 I never really figured it out. Sometimes I could craft	 sometimes not. BUT HEY LETS TALK ABOUT REALISM SHALL WE	 why yes I think we should. The game is not realistic	 and YES I DO KNOW it never claimed to be really. Even if so	 it really tries to go into the territory of simulation and realism with its new mechanics it is adding to the genre	 but the combat damage and the amount we have to drink and eat in order to satisfy our needs is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t	 no game	 I don't need to eat all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. (I recommend potatoes :^) )Either go realism or go arcade	 this weird mix of both is just screwing the other part up. I regret buying it and would 10/10 refund if i still could. Atleast the devs seem to be active and responding to the community feedback."

Sure it has its bugs but its day 1 and they already put out 3 hot fixes. Would have taken years for DayZ dev team to do that. Map looks amazing. Great terrain. Must buy

Now to get into it:I found this game to be boring	 simply put the game had a few cool ideas but more or less its just dayZ with less content and more bugs. I have no doubt that you could get 20$ worth on content out of this game and yes you could say well 20$ is only the price of an average meal	 the game just isnt fun. Infact I fully think the price is 100% fair for the amount of content so dont get me wrong. Yes I have very little playtime in the game as I am sure this is something else that will be brought up	 but in that time I was just bored out of my mind. Playing the game felt more like a chore.TLDR: The price is 100% fair but as far as survival games go	 it dosnt bring very much new stuff to the genere at its current state."

Having all the ground work in first. Once you get the hang of the game it is brilliant and the Dev's have an amazing foundation to build upon. I am more than happy to be supporting them. There is a ""lack of content"" at the moment but this is to be expected as it is early access and like all EA titles this one is a risk you will have to take if you want to play it. But with the price being so insanely cheap for this kind of a game	 it is easy to take that risk. The Dev's have huge plans and already they are showing their supporting nature by releasing a patch about 3 hours after launch to fix some connection issues. These Devs are hard working and they can be trusted. I am really looking towards what new content will be added. I hope this game takes off and gets more love than it is at the moment 30/08/2018"

It has many interesting mechanics	 including the metabolism which seems to be the deciding factor for many people writing negative reviews as well as there isn't much to do as of writing this review(Early Access m8). Although for the few hours i played with my friends	 i really did enjoy it going around surviving and even meeting some randoms(eventually leading to us chopping them up). I really do believe this game has lot of potential and hope the devs don't just give up on this project like many other devs and their titles.Fixes I NEED :D - Server Lag is massive. 30+ players can lower your fps from 70 fps (what i get) to as low as 15-20 fps."

HOWEVER....  If you want to play multiplayer and not encounter massive lag and desync problems then do not buy this as you will probably not be happy.  Check back every couple of months to see if the net code has improved.If you want to host your OWN private server to play with friends then do not buy this game as they have not made the server files available.If you have aleady rented a server that supports game switching and want to switch to this game.. then do not buy this game as only ONE server company is allowed to host the files.  Although the issue with single player save files was fixed this will remain a NEGATIVE review until the other issues are resolved.

The potential it has is limitless	 the systems it has such as food and nutrition	 wet clothes and how they affect your character are meticulously created. Everything is well thought out	 it could use some balancing in some places but there's plenty of time to do that. I love the fact that people can't use third person to sit behind a wall and see exactly where you are magically from around the corner and pop you. this is something EVERY third person game should have and those that are complaining about it are only complaining because the ONLY kills they can get are when they are camping an area never popping up until they're enemy looks away. The robots have killed me more than anything	 more than the zombies and more than the players and I still love them and think they shake the game up and they should keep them at the military zones. The only thing with this game is the servers NEED to be worked on A.S.A.P it's very laggy and jittery and makes gunfights at military hard and sometimes almost impossible. The other thing is they need server restart notifications.... You can't just restart a server without any warning when you have a system in game where you need to put your clothes on the floor around the fire. I went from being packed with enough supply to last me 10 years to I have a dragonov an ak and a bootknife. If they can fix these two things and tweak everything and ignore all the whiney ♥♥♥♥♥es that complain about hardcore games being too hard then this game will be everything DayZ SHOULD have been."

513710	2	0	blainesellman	397	8	1	49.1	September 8	 201	"JUST MY OPINION DISCLAIMER:Scum is awesome because it was developed only after seeing the many mistakes that Rust and DayZ have made in the last several years of their early developments.   This game has a similar RUST Legacy crafting system while also immersive within the DayZ style GUI.  This intelligent and evolutionary strategy by its' developers has allowed SCUM to surge in sales giving it ample finances to quickly get this game on the map while receiving the loyalty of Rust and DayZ fans. In conclusion	 SCUM took all the best from other games and made it better.As of the date of this publication	 I have also concluded that the only drive by players at this point of development is raiding facilities and fighting players in high loot areas	 anything beyond that will result in boredom and the crafting items that have little purpose as of this date. Hopes and Expectations:- Complex land navigation instead of open map- Detailed maps and hidden locations- Fix sounds (I can hear animals and zombie’s way to far away- Hand and arm signals- Croatian towns and cities are way to clean	 this place should look like something out of escape from New York the movie if its always being used as a gameshow.-ETC"

It's an open world survival game with zombies.The open world survival problem of ""killing on sight"" will never be fixed	 because a humble mention of the obvious issue and an idea on how to fix it warrants a kneejerk reaction to the ""super hardcore pvpers"" to instantly start downplaying the idea and insulting the more socially inclined.And talking about social interaction; the map is too ♥♥♥♥ing big and empty.There's such a thing as ""too much""	 and this map is uselessly giant with nothing in it	 and pretty rare fauna. I spend most of my time jogging in one direction holding my RMB just looking for an animal track. And unless you have a firearm	 you're not going to kill it without running around like a jackass	 or hitting the animal and waiting for it to stop running from you	 just to sneak up behind it and whack it once more	 then repeating until it dies. An added bow would easily fix this problem	 but would also give yet another tool for people to kill me when I'm trying to wrap a bundle of rags together	 or trying to make peace.This is another dumb zombie survival game	 I wouldn't bother buying it. In fact	 I wish I didn't spend 4 hours running around looting so I could refund it."

The crafting Mechanic is great maybe complex at first for some but great. Love that People arent bullet sponges.Melee is fun and works. Zombies work great and arent a mess like in so many other games of this genre. The Events keep things fresh if you get bored of basic survival.

If you choose to rent a private server	 there is only one hosting providers and you have NO ability to kick or ban players. Owning a server and being able to moderate it is online gaming 101.- Developers silencing people on forums/discord to warn others about hackers hence making this review (they banned refund customers from accessing forums as well)- Fresh cheating tools you should be aware of (watch?v=n0OUFVRyJbU)	 (watch?v=n0OUFVRyJbU)"

I also think a small addition to being able to build a small base to stash loot rather than just a random box	 and maybe some vehicles would be nice.

The gunplay/movement/health/crafting is amazing animations and effects and just overall flawless. BUT BUT BUT BUT 2 things this game really needs is-better servers they restart constantly I mean it was the first day but anyways and 2nd vehicles/base building the map is massive and there should be vehicles and bases not unreleastic sky scraper like rust but good shelters or being able to board up houses anyway currently 8/10

Still sound fun? oh yes well lets try getting heatstrok on top of the hypothermia (whitch you cant get rid of BTW) now you cant do anything ithout dropping whats in you hands getting sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself then forgetting to pick your wepon up everytime you drop it. ok so if that still sounds fun then try fighting off a puppet btw u cant beat a puppet w.o a wepon ive tryed even with full boxing so yes you die again. ok so to reiterate right now you have hypothermia from being out in the rain for more then 30 seconds cuz if u get wet in a game thats alway raining ur pretty much dead then the sun comes out for 10 minutes in real time you dont get dry so your still hypothermic and now you got heastroke and ur gonna die slowly unless yes u guessed it u kill urself and start it all over. well i know im not the only one complaining about it but if you still want to buy the game and SURVIVE!! during it wait untill they have actually fixed alot of the problems cuz people are only ♥♥♥♥♥ing about robots being tough and not being fortnight they want bases. so while thats being tended to surviving in the survival game IMO see that IMO is impossible unless you hid indoors never to get wet

Almost every single prop in the game cant be searched for loot	 but its a 70% chance there is nothing in it or a piece of paper. My guy is constantly complaining that he is hungry	 but I see no negative effects from not eating. My character never gets thirsty but I find water all over the place. Never any food. If I do find food to eat	 it doesnt keep my character from saying he is hungry. The only redeming factor of this game is the performance. It runs really smoothly. All they need to do is make ammo spawn with the weapon. Guns always spawn with no ammo or a magazine."

This is not too dissimilar.  I crack up at all these feeds	 they always run into people who are like ""yo how do you cook""  and be all friendly.  I assume these streams come from private servers because i have yet to experience anyone do anything other than attempt to kill you.  And even if they don't i'd say the vast majority is not so much cooperative but murderous which is getting annoying in and ov itself. It would be nice if they had other challenges	 avoid robots	 lethal animals	 etc	 and just do away with the zombie theme	 i think that would make this game less of the usual.  ITs also getting tiresome that games like this never really seem to get out of development they are always in a perpetual stage of pre-release it seems and before you know it there is several other similar games with some variation on previous mechanics.  Like say Dayz aftter how many years of being a mod and in development its still not a full realease?  And now we have SCUM which is also not a full release but with more mechanics than dayz.I think this game has great potential but at times i think its actually too heavy on trying to have real world mechanics.  I'm sure after a while you get used to it but the more complex a game is the bugs and glitches you have so it seems it might be better off with a few less mechanics but i'm sure diehards would agree.  I play games for fun not for bullet drop realism	 i like a challenge i don't like wasting my time.  I would say the game is easier to figure out than Dayz but yeah the food calories	 metabloism	 salt etc	 huge learning curve on that stuff.  I am concerned on the value this has on PVP	 since i have yet to meet a co-op player even on a listed PVE server lol.  My handful encounters with other players that degraded into combat had a melee encounter where i had a hatchet the other person a wood spear and some how he took my hatchet from me?  I don't tknow if this is a bug	 hack	 or there is a game mechanic for it	 but that was frustrating.  The lag was bad too	 by the time i could swing at the guy the game caught up and poof he was no where to be seen until i get hit by him.  So it seems once you get near other players the performance seems to tank even if you are in a server with 4 people on it.  Overall its fun to try to learn	 they give a single player mode at least so you can try to figure out what you are doing.  I'd say for $20.00 its worth teh support if they actually make a full release game as opposed to perpertually staying in development but still it is fun and at least different to some degree over similar games.  For now i'd say this is a stop gap game for me until Fallout 76 comes out."

Aside from a shortage of lower level recipes and a depravity of food there's nothing to really complain about. You'll spend the majority of your time trying to keep your metabolic levels up the first 5 to 10 hours. After that you will bunker	 a lot. On a side note anyone expecting this game to be a typical BR like everything else in 2017-2018 will be disappointed. It has solid pvp but the games purpose is to function as a true ""survival simulator""; which it does really well even as limited as the crafting is thus far.  Since this is the closest most people in *current year* will get to actually get to going outside and camping	 10/10 must own."

I didn't follow much of the dev blogs leading up to the early release date	 and I really only purchased it because a friend of mine was really excited for it. I've sunk hundreds of hours into ArmA (not DayZ) and other survival games such as The Forest	 The Long Dark	 ARK	 Rust	 Astroneers	 etc.What I found in SCUM is a genuine attempt at making a survival simulator with a slightly twisted sense of humor.Putting a finer point on it	 SCUM challenges players to micromanage their metabolism and inventory first	 and kill other players second	 and that's where I find a lot of the discontent comes. If I had to put a number on it	 I would say that rougly 80% of the negative comments I've seen regarding this game are due to poor expectation management on the part of the player	 not the developers. Players seem to want an arcade-style PUBG with minimal survival features thrown in there as an aside or they complain about it being too much like other games	 or not enough like other games	 or any other myriad of topics they wish to complain about regarding an early access game - they play it like PUBG	 when they should be thinking more along the lines of what honest	 true survival would look like. This game is a simulation whereby you must manage your food intake	 your inventory	 your gear	 everything. If you don't do this well	 then you're not going to have a good time	 because everything mentioned affects your character in different ways at different times.If you're reading this review and are unsure of whether or not to purchase the game	 consider this: are you looking for a game which strives to be as accurate to real life as possible	 while understanding that it's still being fleshed out in early access and still has bugs	 exploits	 and unpolished details all with a roadmap which could push EA out for years? Are you looking for an experience which will have you walking through the woods for hours looking for mushrooms to eat	 zombies to run from	 towns to loot	 and underground military bases to explore? Or are you looking for an arcade PUBG-lite battle royale where you can easily fast travel and say that you're a historically accurate WW2 battle simulation all while being a female with blue facepaint and a mechanical cybernetic arm who can run on walls with your pink jetpack boots?If you're looking for the latter	 then you're not going to have a good time with SCUM. If you're searching for the former	 then you're in good company and should enjoy yourself playing SCUM. I	 for one	 am having a great time and look forward to what's coming down the pike as the developers implement new features such as vehicles	 missions	 new environments	 basebuilding	 advanced crafting	 and larger urban areas.Cheers."

Seriously	 SCUM does its absolute best to not only capture but improve upon	 by great leaps and bounds	 the spirit of the original DayZ.So far	 one of my favorite aspects is actually the controls. They're smooth	 intuitive	 and easy. Second favorite has to be	 of course	 the UI. I've never seen a more extensive and intelligvent UI for a game	 especially survival. Being able to see every bit of your biometrics is a little unnerving	 but absolutely welcomed. I wonder whose monitor we're watching	 eh? Long-story short: if you liked the original DayZ at all	 enjoy survival games by any amount	 and/or are tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ years of the genre	 grab SCUM.

With little to do so far with various loot and crafting techniques	 there is a lot of fun when stealthily looting the military bases and camps while avoiding the zombies (Puppets) or Sentry Mechs spotting you and attempting to kill you. This is one of the most unique survival games I have played yet	 with adding a challenge when looting high valued locations than just the risk of a few bites from Zeds or the fear of other survivors.There's plenty of crafting to do as we wait for further items and food and equipment to be added down the line	 this is not going to be a Rust-like base building game; which is good for the average serious survivor player. I enjoy having to go out in the woods and first craft a axe if I don't have one	 then chopping a bush for sticks and logs and finally piling them together with my rocks to build my minor shelter so I can spawn there. I think this is a great feeling of a game having ""spirit""	 and a nice emotion when going through the steps to survive.If you are afraid of possible griefers	 I understand as of making this review the game is merely a week and a half old	 but I don't expect some of the aspects of first starting will change ever so drastically down the line. And this helps people be able to reach out to other people for help before coming to conclusion of hunting other people	 as the limited stamina gives you a decision to chase someone down	 each weapon requires a technique to use and skills to have to use them	 and what I liked about an example of Day Z is that there are no tutorials. So you can research for yourself	 or ask for help. There are too many things to result someone to kill on sight for fresh spawns	 and everyone has a unique spawn on the map. And so far	 every spawn will benefit you.I am really satisfied with this game	 the evidence the devs are updating every day gives me hope and good feeling these are truly the right developers for the job; and know how to run the right game. Releasing a game with decent performance and little to no problems on launch with the exceptional visual and game problems is promising enough.Thank you for reading!"

Performance is low at times due to a possible memory leak but the game is a lot of fun.  For a very early access game the bones here are solid for a stellar open world survival experience. Devs are responsive.  Lag issues are to be expected and can make pvp frustrating but overall the core gameplay loop is a blast.I would love more primitive living viability in the future before more guns and advanced technology to favor thinking over luck in looting....  but... still better than DAYZ.

To resolve the situation I just play at 1080p fullscreen	 even though my side monitors get mild scaling issues	 it isn't too much of a bother.

And how the release date came closer and closer i was getting even more hyped for it while watching the streams	 notes	 screenshots	 discord etc. And as soon as the game came out I bought it	 but I actually didn't like it. To be more percise	 i actually found it awfull.I like the survival games genre like DayZ and I thought this will knock DayZ right off the board but it actually isn't even close to being realistic as DayZ	 or atleast on the same level. DayZ is after 4 years still in Alpha we know that	 but tbh I rather play DayZ that's currently still full of bugs (after 0.63 not anymore hopefully) than this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It actually really came a big flop. And the reasons why you think? Well to start of:- The HUD (Looting/crafting) looks terrible. It's litteraly 90% the same as H1Z1.- The servers are horrible	 you aren't able to connect to one of them. I have 38 minutes playtime	 and 20 of those minutes were connecting to a server. And to put a cherry on top the horrible server joining	 every time I couldn't join a server with the reason 'Failed to connect' I get kicked out and placed in the lobby/main menu	 and if I try to join another/same server I AGAIN need to make a character.- Litteraly the other 18 minutes were running from my spawn point to the first city and as soon as I came there i died by a puppet that was hitting me through the house underneath. This already made my conclusion to refund it.- While I was downloading I was watching my mate playing it already and he litteraly went to Airfield and just got endgame/military loot in like 6 hangars or 20 minutes. Like where is the fun in this? You make a 12x12 kilometers map and you can just run towards militray which if you are lucky with your spawn is 10 minutes away and just get endgame loot. And to not start about the Famepoints with spawning on shelter or spawning on teammate	 if you place a shelter close to a airfield it's gg. Or you die and you friend is nearby and you spwan on him	 gg.- Graphics	 look amazing that is atleast 1 great point. You have some nice views and some nice P.O.I. But damn the frames are terrible. I don't have an amazing PC my self but when I first started playing it	 it gave the recommended settings these were high-epic. I got like 20-30 fps on that	 rubbish. I changed it to medium-high	 30-40 fps. low-medium 50-60 fps. And this for a gpu based game on a 1060? And if you are thinking that it's just me or my PC	 look at other streamers/youtuber with PC'S worth more than 2k$	 they are having the same problems but on Epic settings. Having a double 1080ti or a double Titan X and being not able to play a game like this on 80+ fps constantly is just horrible.These are just points I got from playing ~40 minutes and watching footage. If I would actually play this more than 10 hours ( Which I didn't do as I wanted to refund this) I would surely found bugs	 more terrible things	 problems etc.So in conclusion.Really hyped for the game but it didn't came out as it was promised to	 which is pretty sad. This game will surely improve over a periode of time	 but I would say a year or 2 and this game will be good and worth to play/buy. But for now it's pure♥♥♥♥♥♥ And I will surely get it if it's actually fixed in that periode of time.This review doesn't even need to help someone but I you are just aware of what you are getting your self in to."

To get in these you have to time your movements and open a hatch in order to get in without being shot once u loot it you have to get out and hope you dont die with the loot you found. there many more places with good loot and the towns and villages really only give common loot and they are less dangerous than going to a area that has mechs. The game is fun very realistic in every way. In the future the devs have said you will be able to fly planes sail boats drive cars and base build. You will also be able to have a medical skill so you can heal your friends.so far playing this game i have had a alot of fun and i have played alot of other survival games and SCUM even at this early stage is better than them all.I would recommend you buy SCUM and the devs are working hard putting out updates and listening to the community."

It is very easy to find food but he never eats because he is distracted. So he ends up with an unbalanced diet and health issues. But he won't stop playing this game!
513710	1	0	DK_Ninja12	54	2	1	34.5	August 31	 201	I recommend this game. This is a great game and has alot going for it keep the updates coming plz. also trying to squad up with steam friends should be alot easer than it is but other than that once u get started theres not that manny problems becides some server lag once is a wile but still worth the $20 i do recomend you up the price to $25 or $30 and push out some more updates to keep the fan/player base happy keep up the good work and don't be a SCUM about it lmao thanks.

For £15 this game is a steal. There are of course some things that need work	 but this is easily playable and enjoyable as is	 and i highly recommend it.The main complaints i would make after 36 hours of game play (yes 36hours already	 i took 2 days off work to smash it	 im and still not disapointed :P) would be protection against hackers - ive had games ruined due to hackers and it is frustrating. but it is always gonna happen in EA. And the placement of built structures	 it currently places at random	 which is strange considering you can place	 everything else out in a specific location	 from duc tape and building materials to youR AK47 and its mags and ammo... can all be manually by the player on any surface. (a great feature and concept) So why not camp fires and shelters also.Apart from them tiny	 issues	 the game is in great shape for a EA new release	 I love it and it is one of my fav's of all my steam libary of 40+ games. Cant wait to watch it evolve :)Get it whilst its cheap. Also a recommendation	 it is far more fun when you have a squad of 3+."

Staying well fed isnt hard or a grind at all people are just that stupid	 and give up before figuring it out.Cons:I punched someone 15-18 times while they frantically tried to shoot me with a 4 shot bolt action rifle and inevitably died.....?........The areas worth looting have these rediculously intense mech bots that can one shot you in gear....?.....Said above	 wouldnt be an issue because you can outsmart the patterns they move in BUT when a little ball shaped drone thing shines a bright ♥♥♥♥ing light on you	 and an enemy player takes your head off due to this......?.....Day two Desync appears	 ahhh yes as if the spotting system wasn't hard enough to maneuver throw some Desync into the equation and now we have no clue where that guy you were VERY patiently stalking for 2 hours just went.Oh there he is	 he killed you.The outskirts of the map are good for getting started but the moment you attempt to acquire better loot from a mech protected area	 you are either A going to die to a mech and spend a decent amount of time trying to get your loot back OR B die to a player while avoiding a mech. OR C die to a player. OR D die to another player. Yeah your ""fame' points are now in the negative and you can no longer spawn near that area so tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ spend the next 30 minutes running back to your friends with nothing and try to survive.Sometimes I get lag when a large city or area is loading in but it only lasts a few seconds and is gone.The RPG aspect	 leveling up skills looks like it might take an entire month of played time to see an advantage if you ever level up skills.Mech's are killable	 15+ people non stop firing at it took 4-5 minutes to die	 no fame reward	 no loot.The shooting in this game seems like an arcade game	 highly unrealistic	 exteremely difficult due to desync and buggy situations both up close	 mid	 and afar.Summary: No building and VERY VERY limited crafting. If you enjoy grind without reward this is the game for you. If you like games where you arent sure if you should shoot at the bear attacking you because you need that ammunition for pvp	 and the bear kills you anyways. This game. Is for. You. The game is off to a great start despite all the negative cons	 mechs are actually nice because they kill your opponants and alert when one is nearby once sighted. the game is lacking alot of content but that will come in time. Between the struggles of dayz	 rust	 pvp survival style games with a Scum twist	 it's hard for me to enjoy Scum right now.Recomendations: Way way way more crafting options to keep players occupied between looting adventures that are high risk atm. Psilocybin mushrooms upon consumption and absorbtion should induce a physcadelic trip effect with some sort of benefit (heightened scenses	 mechs dont see you etc) temporarily	 and also growing a tolerance to them so it becomes more difficult to maintain this advantage. optional servers that allow base building. More realistic melee damage. 5-7 solid hits should knock a motha ♥♥♥♥a down especially when youre max muscle and 100% on all stats....... Zombies need alot of work	 some are like superman on crack	 this isnt a bad thing though it's a nice challange that can be solved with a single head shot. -  And most of all Desync needs to be gone	 there is literally no way to tell if your hits actually register on someone with bullets or melee."

But id really like to put my 2 cents into this game because i have been patientally waiting for this game to come out and although the game is pretty good there are a few things i would liked tweaked.Things i like- Events ! (these ♥♥♥♥♥es are some of the most fun i have had with the game and a great way to get points. Although they need to happen more frequentally or even just a tab in the main menu to put u in a que for one so u can grind up points)- guns and ammo are accesable (although id like to see the clips spawn with ammo a little more often and would it hurt to always spawn guns with a clip? im sick of the goose chain. this game is one of the easyiest survival games to find a gun and clip so thats nice atleast- zombies dropping decnt loot (especally specail zombies like the military ones)Things i dont like-random spawn costs points or atleast cost to much-more towns or a smaller map would have been nicer the distance between and orange blips on your map is always a hike which isnt very fun espaclly when u spawn on the other side of the map from friends. you think the devs would have learned that from dayz Big map size is bad-super gay eating system my guys always hungry and the overcomplex matabalism is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - no tansport on laugh which for this map size is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- loot is pretty hard to find somtimes-friends are not perminent and u can not see them on mapfinal verdictthis is one of the best and smoothest survival game lauches and im hoping to watch this game reach maximum patental.7/10 ATM Buy it and play 4 3 hours see what u think (and if your me refund it and buy it again cause i didnt get anywhere in 3 hours lmao)

From hour number 1 to now over 40hrs in game since release I have been amazed with the scenery	 the survival brake down with the BCU monitors	 the weaponry choice	 the hunting of players and animal. Just everything is in a wow factor for me and my twitch community. There are a few improvements though that im looking forward to that need to be addressed...needs more optimization	 player dysnce and what i believe is a slight memory leak after about 3hrs of gaming without client refresh. I have no idea of what people are calling ""end game"" loot for this is a survival game and there really is no such thing as end game. Realize before buying this game that it is EA and will only improve from here. Only cost $20 when i feel it shouldve cost way more. DayZ has bee surpassed and will never be as good as this. 10 out of 10 in my book after the current issues are fixed. Well done Devs. P.S Devs your robots aim snap needs to be adjusted. Tad op in the state that they are in. Just my opinion though."

513710	1	0	deridealized	284	23	1	16.7	September 1	 201	"My first impressions to counteract the negative reviews.Firstly. This game is demanding.The negative reviews regarding performance are seemingly from users with lower end PC's. This is not me being superiour	 some are more fortunate than others	 and some expect all games to cater to all audiences. The fact is that this game is out there for people with ""beast rigs"".I am fortunate enough to have a top end PC (all hail finance solutions) and I have encountered only a small number of issues:We just finished a ~6 hour session	 in that time I experienced a small handful of frame drops to the 30 mark	 which lasted no more than 5 seconds a time. (Running at max settings ~70fps average). Not a problem if you ask me..(my specs at the end if you really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥)The servers seem reasonably stable	 in this time we were disconnected only twice. Which leads me to my next point	 this game has virtually no loading screens! Loading back into a server takes less than 10 seconds	 which is fantastic.Now that I have said my piece negating the main negative reviews	 here is my input regarding the game and it's current state.The creators of this game have evidently played many survival games before. In my eyes they have taken the best from other games and made something fun. To me it feels like Arma 3's movement with better animations and fluid climbing	 Miscreated's graphics on overdrive and a similar playstyle regarding loot and stealth	 plus DayZ's player vs world no mercy atmosphere. All of the aforementioned points have been refined into a very smooth game. Movement is fluid	 items are all dealt with in a ""vicinity"" meaning that all crafting	 looting and trading can be done if things are on the ground within a certain radius. You want to give a friend some food? Click and drag it to wherever you like	 no more looking around aimlessly.In the 5 hours with my friend	 we covered approx ~5km (<3 miles). In that time we laughed til we cried at the fact you can poop (side note	 after extensive testing	 the poop has physics). The detail in this game is great	 the graphics are AAA	 the sound design is impeccable and the attention to detail is beyond anything I was expecting: Poop physics	 dirty clothing	 accurate animations.I was hesitant to purchase this game due to the reviews	 but I don't regret it. You can tell some love went into this title.In this time playing I might not have even scratched the surface of the content on offer (have I now experienced it all? No idea) but what is important is that tonight was enjoyable and I will be playing again tomorrow.TL;DRAttention to detail in all aspects are great. Graphics fantastic. Servers stable. AI on point. I reckon alone it may not be as fun but with a friend was great. Many negative reviews are from people with lower end PC's (again	 not a judgement	 just a fact) and this game requires something powerful. (Speccy told me that my CPU was running at 81C at it's highest	 my friends at 95.. - back down at 40 writing this) It's a demanding title!Apparently this means something to some people so SPECS:I7 7700k16gb RamNvidia 10803tb HDD100% maxed settings average ~70fps	 lowest ~30fps	 highest ~110fps.£15 is a steal. That is a perfectly reasonable asking price for a game of this magnitude and polish. If this is early access then I am excited to see what is next.Cheers."

I mean there is work to be done don't get me wrong	 but overall there is potential to grow.-Add Auto Run Hotkey/Toggle -Introduce Land and Air vehicles. I really could see this game with a plane and chopper. The views from high up on the mountains are stunning. -Fix them odd Micostutters and FPS Drops which require a restart. It can be underwhelming when you're getting so into the game. -Personally Loot distrubution needs to be upped some what. If you're looking for a more high pop server literally every town is looted and respawns are very slow in my honest opinion."

Yes. I am however willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt as I already expected these sort of problems before I purchased the game	 anyone that played PUBG in it's early days will know how much of a hot mess it was back then. I think what the devs are trying to accomplish here is commendable and once they start ironing out the bugs and adding in new content to get the game to where they envision it being then I think we will have a game that will be around and enjoyable for a while to come. I remain optimistic for the future of this game as long as the devs don't♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed and pull a Culling on us."

Buy this game it is worth the $20 for sure. The issues (small considering what a fail DayZ Standalone is) will be ironed out soon enough.the game as an early access is a 8/10

The core mechanics are in place and the day one release works better than any first week early access game I've played. Therefore you are getting a big upvote.

Yes the game is early access which means there are some connectivity issues and sometimes huge lag spikes.But all of those things are expected when buying an early access title on the first day tbh.Now for the Gameplay. Not having played many survival games before this was new to me so I cannot compare the game to other games of the Genre.You start on an Island with literally nothing but your clothes on the first 5 times i didnt know how to get into the ""flow"".But after testing it you get better and better.You start off cravting your first weapons going into a city loot up find a reliable food resource gear up even more and start to feel stronger and stronger.Here is the first point i wanted to make which should be developped. At the start of the Game a Zombie is ok to deal with and your not gonna die immediatly even if you just have a wodden spear	 you would wanna avoid getting into a horde though. But if you progess a little and are geared on military equip and your food is taken care off there are no real threats on the map + pretty much nothing to do.On my first server i got to the point where my calorie Intake was at 120.000 kcal and I only used about 13.000 kcal.There is no real downside to overfeeding besides you having to poop like every 2 minutes.So for the next 4 hours on this server I never had to eat or drink again which killed the threat of starvation.If you	 like me got the Endgame Gear aswell. I had a KAR98 with scope and a PUMP-action rifle there is no real zombie threat aswell since you either shoot them from 500 meters where they wont attack you or a horde runs at you and they just get mowed down.So i started finding and killing other players but the Map is waaaay to big for 64 people to play so even if you search for them you not really gonna find anyone.But! You can Hunt a Bear and wear his skin as clothing and look like a Bear which was so fun. (There is a screenshot of it on my Profile).In summary the point I wanted to make is	 the game starts out as being really hard but once you know what to do its not that hard at all	 and at the moment the real downside for me is being there is a point where you are really with nothing else to do. I hope they do add some Lategame content to this game because its just super cool for the first 4-5 hours on a server but gets really boring after that.The one massive issue with this game is crafting. There have been numerous times where I had every single material combination possible for things i wanted to craft but the game wouldnt let me do it. Which gets super frustrating after a while bc most of the time if you cant craft the stuff you have to leave the material behind. This leads you to spending half an hour to gather material just to find out the game wont let you do it anyway. As for the Graphics. The game looks Beautiful even as I am not able to play on high settings due to my computer not being built for this :).So Pros and Cons.PROS- A lot of fun to get into- Nice Graphic- Super much Fun to play with friends- You really getting the sense of achieving something as you get stronger and stronger- There are a lot of things to do at the start and a lot of ways to play this gameCONS- Lack of a real endgame content. Once you are geared up with military equip and established a steady food source there   isnt really anything to do.- Frustrating crafting system. I managed to craft pretty much everything possible by now but there have been times where     I couldnt craft the stuff I wanted even though i had all the tools . The thing is once I gave the same materials  I wanted to    use for crafting to a friend he could do it without any reason plausible.Would I recommend this game?Yes	 absolutely. Its so much fun to play and you can play in so many different ways. I hope the developpers gonna add a real End game content and more crafting and fix the bugs that crafting currently has.I am sorry for my bad English or any spelling mistakes I made	 since English isn't my native language."

513710	18	0	fruitmentos	90	4	1	15.3	September 10	 201	"After 10+ hours of playing I feel I am ready to write a fair and honest review.Pros:-Awesome metabolism and digestion mechanics-Great climbing/vaulting animations-Hunting pays off-This game forces players to actively scavenge for food so no one can stay in one area for too long-Amazing layering system-Very large and detailed map-Melee combat isn't terrible and you have the ability to lock onto a target-Plenty of loot spawns-It is a BLAST to play with friends-In-depth information about your players physiological status-Character Creation-Good weather system and day and night cycle.-Realistic saturation and weight.-Good in-game voice chat (there is also text chat	 server wide and proximity)-The awareness system is amazing	 you can only see what your characters eyes see or what your ears hear meaning that you cannot be third person peeked unless you are making a lot of noise.-This game makes me feel like a scavenger. Hiding from the Mechs and looting while their backs are turned is an exhilarating experience-The puppets (zombie like AI) are an actual threat to your survival.-Good medical mechanics i.e. painkillers	 antibiotics	 vitamin supplements actaully help	 charcoal pills etc.-----Cons:-Memory leak causes your frames to drop the longer you play the game (Start at 80+ in an hour I am at 25)-Gunplay is alright and needs some work (If a round is chambered you cannot unchamber the round in the gun but you can take the magazine/clip out)-If a player or animal is in motion when you kill it there is a chance it's body will go flying in the direction they were moving-Holstered Weapons sometimes go into the player model and it looks a bit wonky.-Lag and Desync issues (though the lag hasn't caused ME to desync/DC the issue is still prevalent)-The mechs (large robots that gaurd the high risk	 high reward areas on the map for those that haven't played yet) can be a bit wall-hacky and spot you through a corner	 sometimes even killing you.-The puppets sometimes go through walls or hangar doors-Relatively low player count compared to the great size of the map-A few optimization issues	 the game is already optimized well but there is always room for improvement.-Melee animations could use a small bit of work.-If you have a bigger character your arms clip through your player model (in the Latissimus Dorsi area)-------I didn't mention the lack of content due to the recent release of the title. Yes	 there is a lack of content as of now	 mostly firearms and firearm attachments. There is a wide array of melee weapons that you can find on the map. Before buying be prepared to run	 like alot	 the map is massive so this comes with its own set of pros and cons. You might not run into players that often unless you go to the high risk high reward areas. This game isn't just straight PvP	 its survival	 and thats exactly what it makes you do. There are events however that are like team deathmatch and you go in with a full kit and battle it out with other players but the base game is survival. I hope the devs stay true with the survival aspect of the game and don't join the battle royale band wagon. I feel as time goes along and as long as the devs stick to it the game will have a lot of success. In my humble opinion I think that the game is worth the $20."

Its smoother	 and not as buggy. actually know whats wrong and being able to see your food intake and hydration intake is nice. But I died not because I was hungry but because i wasnt taking in any sugar... crafting it pretty straight forward. shoots nice. zombies arent stupid and dont glitch to much so you can fight and a dodge their attacks pretty easy. Player base is friendly right now (huge plus). Its fun. But just Dayz upgraded...or how it should have been. For $20 i think its a good game even if it doesnt go anywhere...

513710	0	0	Hijiku	232	28	1	7.7	September 10	 201	"This review is more of a ""first impressions"" if anything	 and I will ammend it after playing more. I should also mention that I have played mostly in single player	 and only dabbled in multi player briefly.I saw the bad reviews and horror stories of terrible lag on multiplayer and very nearly decided against getting this game	 but I'm glad I went with my gut on this. This game is very involved	 and will have you second guessing your real-life dietary choices.Like most players (I presume) I was a bit put off by the daunting stat screen	 but about 3 hours into it	 I found myself referring to my basic nutrition textbook and chemistry books from back in high school to try and figure out what to eat to maintain a balance of vitimins and minerals	 and referring to some obscure survival handbook to figure out which mushrooms were safe to eat. (spoiler	 don't eat the red ones with white spots)The game has crashed only once for me	 which honestly didn't bother me all that much since I was able to pick up right where I was with no issue	 and stuff like that is to be expected in an early access game like this	 so meh	 I don't let it bother me.A warning to people wanting to play	 this game does require a bit of a beefy rig to play smoothly	 but you can sacrafice graphics quality for better preformance on lower-end rigs. I play on medium settings	 and the only gripe I have for that setting is the way shadows look all square and blocky. There is an occasional stutter when walking into a new area as things render in	 but it's a minor annoyance to me	 and again to be expected in early access. Multiplayer from what I've seen so far needs quite a bit of work before I would be willing to go all in and do something like rent a server for my friends and I to play on	 but so long as you connect to a server that's relatively close to where you actually live	 the rubber-banding and stutter isn't so bad that I would give an instant thumbs down. The inclusion of a single player mode really saves this game	 though if I could reccommend only one thing to the devs	 it would be to give us the ability to host peer to peer within our single player modes. If you guys can do that	 and have it work well enough that it isnt completely broken	 this game would basically replace my addiction to Arma 3 Exile.TLDR: At $20	 I can say with total confidence that this game is deffinately worth your time if you are a fan of truly hardcore survival simulation. :)"

I Like the crafting and the size of the world	 with ideas like being able to train the horses to ride them things sound positive. I have made it into a restricted zone after 5 atempts it was worth the stealth and made me feel like getting the loot was worth the 3 Hour effort. Lets see from here as now I have collected some decent loot what does it mean? I only hope this does not end up like Just Survive where I had everything and nothing more to do	 but I am thinking that this will more than likely be the case	 who knows if they keep adding things and keeping everything basic then its possible that this could become something great. The Graphics are fantastic and the World is beautiful	 but I would like to see the Boats used and the idea of going on a fishing trip using things you made to catch fish. Like a net made from Rope	 then you can sell the fish at a market. Also a trading zone for goods and a general Market place in one location. Perhaps the idea of a Hotel where you can strip for money or spend money on strippers. Maybe a Hotel Brothel owner or an owner of a Pub where you can be taken over by other factions or syndicates. The world is the devs oyster with this game."

From the day this game was publicly announced I've been DYING to play it	 it looked so cool	 so realistic	 and being a fan of realistic shooter and open world games I've been anticipating the arrival of this one	 and oh boy was I EXCITED to try it out.  So far so good	 there are a few bugs here and there but it isn't as bad as it could be! Most Alpha stage games are much worse when it comes to bugs. Not only that but the bugs aren't even impactful to gameplay.   Overall	 the game shows a lot of promise and possibility- The crafting	 the survival	 your odds against your enemies in the game	 it all involves some sort of skill. Whether it's intelligence to craft some more ammo for your long range weapons or strength to make quick work of your enemies- every single point you put into your character counts! It really is a unique and practical way to keep balance	 allowing certain players to have the upper hand in certain situations	 and it encourages the recruitment of other players that have skill where you lack it.  There's more I'd talk about but I'm afraid I would bore those reading this.

There was this dayz browser wich i dont really recall the name of	 but my game wouldnt launch from steam otherwise i would have had upwards of 3000 hours played. Scum is very much like dayz...

Its doesnt feel like just a cash crab (wich dayz has become at this point... they are riding a dying horse.. the fact that it took them 10 years to release also hurt them) this game seem to have developers who really have a passion for these types of games.. and if i wouldnt be wrong	 they most likely liked dayz too and what it tried to be.

And you better watch that stomach of yours - when you gotta go	 you gotta go!! ;D ###Except for PUBG I've never played any kind of survival games before	 so this is quite new for me. I like the game allthough there's still some things to be fixed.I don't know if I managed to join the ""wrong"" server? At first it was really good. No lags	 even if my FPS was down to about 65-67 (comparison : pubg ~117-120	 CS:GO between 150-200+). On the other hand I think we were less than 4 players on that particular server when I first joined. Joined the same server yesterday (continue) and there was about 46 players and it was really	 really laggy. FPS was down to 50-55-ish and just couldn't do much of anything. Needs to get fixed.Unless other players wrote guides on ""how-to"" for certain things	 it can be tricky for a beginner (and I mean beginner as in never played any games like this before) such as myself	 to find out how to start a fire	 open a can etc. In other games yes	 you do select two items to combine	 so I tried it but it didn't work at first (you have to do a little more than that and sometimes do it a few times until that ""open"" text shows). Would've been nice to be able to have some kind of ""help"" button ingame.But I guess you learn with time as you're playing.# Fighting the zombies needs some work. If you stand too close it's like the shots will go right through them.Standing by a window and shooting needs some work too because sometimes it's like you're shooting blanks. When you're fighting several zombies at the same time and you need to switch weapons while in a fight	 it seems like the items in quick access keep switching places (number). So if I have the Hunter 55 and run out of bullets and want to switch to another weapon or shovel for instance	 I end up with only fists and it takes a few seconds before I get my other weapon out. This weapon/item switch delay is bad and can cause you to die. # Another thing: I got stuck in a window by standing close looking out	 I only managed to come out of it by accidentally hitting my prone button.# Inviting friends needs some work too. It would be nice if upon invite	 they'ld end up on the same server you're on automatically. Right now it seems they get an invitation to the game but for the game only and not to play with YOU.Also it would help if you could easily check what server you're on	 because I haven't seen that anywhere.  The actual name/number of the server you join is maybe not something you pay attention to at first	 unless you know about it. [ Edit: They did add a feature where you can now at least see the latest server you played on]It doesn't seem like you can add a server to favourites unless you die...? (or am I wrong?)Atm I have to check TCP-connection to let my friends know what server i'm on...or take a guess among favourite servers.Anyway	 overall I find this game fun and quite relaxing - unless you run into zombies or robots ;D The robots are HUGE and intimidating which is good	 and I like the ""enter at your own risk"" : gamble your life and your loot by accessing certain areas concept! Fix servers and gameplay and this game will be on plus! It is early access but I hope these issues will get fixed	 and if so i do recommend this game.My PC:GeForce GTX 1060MSI Infinite X Core i7	 3.2GHz RAM: 16GB Benq 27"" XL2720Z 144HzCorsair Neutron Series XT 480GB SSD + 256GB SSD +1TB ext.

I was really enjoying it up until that point and it completely killed it for me. Found a guy in a police station looting	 I had a shotgun and at firt he had nothing. He came at me with the shovel so I shot him and he ran off. A little later he came back to the police station and I notice the game was struggling to figure out if it should load his character or not. Guns were floating in the air and if I moved around the corner he turned into a blur. He rushed me and got one shot with a pistol. I then shot him with the shotgun again and he ran behind the building. Then a zombie came in so I jumped inside a house window. He kept strafing back and forth in front of the window taking my shotgun rounds to the face while going back and forth between invisible. It then caused my game to lag extremely hard since rendering became such an issue so I ended up losing from two pistol shots even though I was fully geared. I get the idea with not letting people render during certian times	 but even when he was running around in plain sight he'd vanish at times which makes no sense. They're wanting to be very realitic with this gamea so why make it so people can't be seen right in front of you? I get it's got bugs	 but some of that is part of the game and I find that to be very broken and will give some people way to high of an advantage. Just make people visible if they're right in front of you."

The engine is great	 the game looks very nice	 it's smooth	 I got 60+ FPS on my i7 7700HQ and GTX 1060 laptop on the preset high / epic settings. I also really	 really like the metabolism system and the inventory system. Crafting is great too. I love how inertia works and in general I just love the way the game runs - this is most likely going to be one of my favourite games at some point in the future but right now it's essentially a tech demo with a couple of things to kill or be killed by.I had to refund the game	 I'd love to stick around and support the game but after playing for 90ish minutes I had absolutely nothing to do after getting a few guns. I don't want to rush to the main areas without a vehicle just to find someone to kill.I'll buy the game immediately when the following features are added: - Vehicles or any mode of transport other than foot - Better melee system; I think swinging everything looks a bit ineffective - Some kind of mode or map or player limit to help with the population density - Better servers	 the current ones all show 999 ping	 I have to refresh twice to get under 50 ping every time"

Now to get to the point	 don't get it in the current state	 apparently they just hyped the game up without actually making sure that the features present in the first release are actually working and stable	 but I guess that's what you get when your testers all have dedicated streaming PCs with gaming rigs that have 8700Ks and 1080TIs	 so don't get fooled by the streamers. Between the game crashes and the server crashes and restarts you won't even get a smooth 2 hour experience to at least miss the refund period and that is not even the end of it. The optimization is crap	 the character creation is very limited at the moment	 most of the skils are not even in the game and the ones that are will most likely be reworked over and over again	 the shooting mechanics are absolutely attrocious while the desync and teleportation of the mobs and players plus the wanky hitboxes and animations make accidental team kills a very possible outcome especially since the melee attacks are not worth using because of the aforementioned reasons.No	 I do not recommend this game in its current state	 unless you're keen on paying for being a QA tester which I'm tired of with all these early access games that are released in this format over and over again in the past few years. What I do recommend is wait untill this game actually gets some content going for it and then buy it so that it doesn't pull off a Dayz as well."

Also NO MTX.A more in-depth update after some more cumulative time played and a few small patches:Graphics:The graphics are fantastic. Some of the best I've seen in an open world game. The lighting in particular stands out. Run through a forest on max settings as the sun comes up and you'll see what I mean. Each tree/bush/whatever has an individual shadow map and the sunrays only penetrate what they can	 just like in real life. Individual leaves get illuminated	 etc. Some of the textures look PS2 era but it's EA so these may or may not be improved upon.Performance: I am running a Ryzen 1600 @ 3.8Ghz	 16gb DDR4 3200	 and GTX1060 6gb @ 2.1Ghz core and 9Ghz effective memory clock. I average 50-65 fps on MAX settings at 1080p resolution. Literally everything turned up to the maxmimum allowed value. I get the VERY occasional dip into the 30s. It's very playable and looks gorgeous. The one outstanding performance issue I've encountered so far is the massive stuttering/freezing issue when approaching a new large town or similar. Game is installed on a new Intel 660p NVME SSD and the load times are instantaneous so I can't speak for loading times on a conventional mechanical hard drive or sata SSD.Content:Well there is none right now. Once you figure out how to stay alive by crafting and hunting	 you've pretty much seen what the game has to offer. The micromanaging of all the vitamins and nutrients seems to not matter at all right now but there is a very complex system in place for it.Most people rush military bases and try to PVP but the PVP is a little lackluster at best and buggy/laggy right now. This is NOT PUBG so don't play it as such. If you go rushing into a firefight and die	 you lose everything and have to start over from ZERO unless you stashed some goods away somewhere. The ""awareness"" system makes it indifferent to play in 3rd person or 1st person but it can get a little buggy at times with people randomly popping in even though they should have been viewable for awhile.Sound:Sound design deserves a special mention as it's pretty spectacular. The directional audio works well. Ambient noises make it genuinely creepy to run through the woods at night alone with headphones on.I will be adding more to this review as I accumulate more played time."

513710	9	5	DreamsStarsDeath	30	3	-1	1.3	August 30	 201	"Hi	 here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game	 like many of us.PROS-Cheap price -Besides that	 nothing outstadning	  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.CONS-Poor optimization	 I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p	 in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra	 but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM	 usually 55 when in forest	 which is bad	 since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.-Servers... Before releasing a game	 might as well check if servers work	 I can't connect to most of the servers	 or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks	 and by no loot I mean nothing found	 besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) -The mouvement is not great	 feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.-The Metabolism	 which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system	 it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch	 this game is a shame to UE4Overall-Unfinished	 and by that I mean it's not working properly	 not the lack of content	 I understand that it's early access	 but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it	 so that people can play it	 and then add new content and mechanics.I'm extremely dissapointed with the game	 I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it"

But this review will be the one to tell it how it is!The game is not for the faint of heart; it is very detailed with how the human body works so YES you will need to hydrate	 consume proper / non lethal foods and make sure you're staying in shape. The mechanics are solid but have their flaws along with some things in the game (at the moment) are bugged and don't allow for the smoothest gameplay.The graphics are beautiful on epic and ok on low but it's like that on any open world game. The gameplay is solid; loot	 evolve	 get your skills up and dominate. The game is in early access so of course this is going to have bugs and things in it that frustrate you..... but thats what early access is.If you want to play a great game before its full release	 buy this game and enjoy the open world survival concept that is SCUM	 but be ready to fight through some bugs. If you want to wait for full release and not deal with the bugs	 wait a few months. But regardless	 if you like survival games	 this is a GREAT buy!"

Take elements from every survival game out there	 DayZ	 Miscreated	 H1Z1 and even a bit of Tarkov along with all it's unique features. It runs great on my 1080 SC 60+ frames. I've been playing on friends private server and probably only D/C'd 2-3 times during my playtime and it was a 30 second loading screen to get back in.If you like survival games this is a must have imo."

What it doesn't capture however is DAYZ's amazing believable scenery and game world. This feels very sparse and considerably more 'game like' than real. It's a kind of meeting between DAYZ and Miscreated at the moment. Overall I like what I see and looking forward to growing into it even more as things progress. If you're a fan of the genere then it's a no brainer for 20 quid	 buy it.Getting 50FPS constant on Epic settings with GTX1080Ti	 16GB and a four y/o i7 CPU."

The games overall performance is pretty bad and the graphics are decent but not anything special. The game runs really bad at multiplayer and even with a good computer there is a good chance u have bad performance on your PC.2. The servers are really bad 	 first hour i tried to get into one and after i made my character (You need to remake character everytime so dont waste your time on that) and got into the game the server was lagging so bad	 i kept teleporting around and couldnt open the doors.3. The looting system is terrible	 you get alot of stuff that you dont need and dont find any necessarys ones	 forget finding something to eat	 i ran around for 3 hours and every person i met was looking for food. All the guns you find need a mag and u cant really loot the military places because they are guarded by robots who spot u through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and kill you.4. Pvp is so laggy	 you will need an hour to kill one person with a pickaxe because you keep missing and wasting your stamina.5. Overall view of the game seems pretty bad at this state so thats why i wouldnt recommend buying this game at this state. They would need to fix alot of stuff before this game is playable.6.

Despite the stutters/FPS drops	 I think the game has a huge amount of potential. Unfortunately I've lost my patience with these types of games too. I caaan't do all that running	 I will literally fall asleep or get bored within an hour. Not only that Dayz was not as complicated as this game aims to be. I understand for the sake of realism go make it as realistic as possible but understand that this is a game and so if I swtich over to the Metabolism tab and it ends up making me feel like I am trying to work the shower at a friends house then something isn't right. But it's a work in progress so I'd say the game is worth trying especially at how it was priced. :) 7.8/10 (for now..)"

It takes all the best parts of those games and combines them.  PROS-It's not hard to find loot	 i'm ussualy decently geared within 30-60 minutes of looting	 faster if i hit some military compounds or the airfield.  -easy to find friends with the map	 but it might take a bit of time to get to them (Not anywhere close to as bad as finding friends in dayz and the issue will be fixed later once they add vehicles).   -Decently optimized	 i get some stutter every now and then (only thing i have turned down is shadows)-fun community	 everyone is relativaly nice	 but watch your backCons-stutter every now and then-server connection issuesThis game isn't for everyone.  If you played dayz	 arma	 or just survive and hated those games	 you wont like this one.  Just because your favorite streamer likes and playes this game doesnt mean you will.

So far there hasn't been too much performance issue besides memory leaks.

So	 the fact that I am writing a review is a big thing. I would rather be playing the game.My first comment is to the crybaby salt kings and snowflakes.THIS IS NOT A BATTLE ROYAL!!!!!!! It is NOT A PUBG CLONE. Call of Duty kiddies will NOT LIKE this game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you expect INSTANT COMBAT ACTION!!!!!!This Game is (AN OPEN WORLD SURVIVAL GAME!!!!!!!) The Map is about 144K Square. With All types of Terain.But hey	 play the game the way you want to. Ill still shoot you in the face if you try to PubG me. And I will Defacate on your corpse. Or	 I may share my can of Spam with you If you stop to say HI.Now on to the review.I absolutely love this game. I WILL and DO recomend this game to ANYONE considering buying it. This game on ""DAY ONE"" has SURPASSED all expectations of most any other survival game on the market current and former.This Game IS the DayZ killer.It has done on day one what DayZ has not been able to produce in over 5 years of development. I like that they will NOT be implimenting BASE building. But instead have chosen to go the Fortification route. I can not wait to see that system implimented.The Environment in this game is Truely Amazing. The volumetrics and weather are wonderful. I can not comment on the music. I always keep it turned off. Plainly stated SCUM has taken pretty much the best of the Genre and added it to their gamewith VERY little to complain about. Most of the problems will most likely be fixed quickly. And the problem list is very short indeed.In the End	 I recomend buying this game if you love open world Survival games.This is the best one I have EVER played to date.Its been nice knowing you DayZ. Actually no	 It hasn't."

Cautiously I celebrated and began to butcher the creature	 encumbered with loot only taking 9 steaks. as the search for an overnight shelter to cook and escape the SCUMmy weather brought me to a tower i found about a mile away. night fell and the rainfall started. as i cooked and ate my dinner i was smug sitting in front of the fire. looking out the window at the dark rainy night as  i inventoried my treasures	 thinking of all the close calls i had and of all the poor hungry fools out in the cold rain with no gear.

The game looks amazing and runs fairly well for an early access game.The fact that the devs plan to add primary	 secondary	 and side missions	 and well as endgame content and vehicles	 has me really intrigued.I've taken loads of screenshots as the game looks gorgeous at times.It's best played with friends."

It throws me into character customization but half of the things are locked. After i finished ""customizing"" my character it threw me into the game without a tutorial. I had no idea what to do. The game is very buggy and really slow-paced. 10 minutes into the game i meet my first enemy and find out that the fighting mechanism is absolutely horrible. I can punch like two times and it drains my whole stamina. Behind me a few more enemies spawned and i got killed. I did not have the nerves to start over so i decided to refund the game and get my 20 euros back. The game might get better in the future but so far it is REALLY bad and i do not recommend you to buy it."

It has looting feels like rust but alot better. The map is massive and it gives you alot of time to get started up so when you do come across PVP one on one you should be ready and be armed. I hope they add a way to connect in game with your friends and they spawn with you. But for now you can use the map and it has a arrow marker where your current spot is. The game is optimize and runs smooth if this isnt happening for you try and find a good server with decent ping. If your into a shooter battle game like rust this is a little different as the PVP is slow unless you go to a busy server or play the mini events when in game. If your into a crafting slash zombie looting and a little PVP type game this is up your alley. I would say get it now before the price jumps to 60 dollars once its fully made. Supporter Pack was worth it was fun seeing my guy poop some intresting items like a pineapple lol.  I injoy this game its sort of ark style but with a madmax army feel.  I hope they also add a teaming or tribing with the game then people will have gangs that can raid other gangs in the game or claim different locations within the game map. They can also include a traiding or currency within the game world. Hopefully they keep the map big it was smart idea so you dont constently die as a new spawn was very well thought in that aspect. I also like that it isnt another crappy battle royal its a open world pvp crafting game. The only things that hopefully will get fix would be guns rage	 small tutorial	 a tribe or gang adding and more items to craft like building a base."

Interestingly looting is really fun. The crafting system is really detailed. Overall if you liked Dayz you will love this game. Thumbs up for me. I hope devs will be adding  and fixing more stuff to the game.

Making a shelter or a base is useless only use for it is to respawn. Make more ways to store your items and make a way that you can store your items where only you can access them. Delete ADS without a scope since its useless and it only lowers your FOV. Add more pistols and more attachments to guns so we get a bit of a variety. Fix that mechs can sometimes see you through walls. I understand that making a Open World game like this is hard and it takes a lot of time to make it run smothly but if you are going to make a game like that you need to know that too. Also add more animals and add hunting sites where you can find different gear and guns and attachments as a place where players can go before looting a military base or airport and get a bit of gear for them without having to worry about players with guns and mechs.

I found 1 building and there was a massive ♥♥♥♥ off robot that almost killed me. Upon me trying to leave the building a player came with 25 different AK47s with 20 different scopes and flashlights and a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attached to barrel	. Upon him showing the said♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into my mouth i preceeded to die. The game then told me im not popular and i have to wait 25 seconds to respawn. I then spawned near an ocean even further from friend. There was a bunker with a beeping more annoying than gay porn ads on♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥com. I then tried to enter the bunker but after breaking my F key	  trying to open the door	 i got teleported 5 feet into the air	 after which i lost 85% of my health. After the drone deafaning me with beeps he proceeded to fly away	 i started searching drawers and i found matches. Upon picking up the matches	 they appeared inside my hardrive and burnt the game file off of my system	 causing the game to crash. All in all	 the most fun part was deciding how fat i want my character to be. Sprinting mechanics suck♥♥♥♥♥♥ Have you ever used a scroll wheel to run? The metabolism menu also made me know about my character more than i know about myself. I now know how long ago my character took a♥♥♥♥♥♥and in how long he needs to do so again.

The map is huge	 the play mechanics are fun	 the immersion is there	 and the game's early access release is already arguably better than where DayZ is now - a game that's been out since Q4 2013. I've definitely found myself wanting to play longer after I'd already been playing a couple hours.I'm really hoping the devs can keep going full steam ahead which it seems like they are. Since playing on opening day almost 2 weeks ago	 there have been MANY updates to apply bug fixes	 add small content	 and make QoL changes.There are still plenty of bugs	 especially desync in PvP. And despite a huge	 open world to explore	 it still feels as though there isn't much to do sometimes. If more bug fixes are made and more content is added for players who are already looted for the most part then this game is already looking great for release."

The skill levelling system is really bad. would take weeks to level anything up. on the plus side it does look really great visually. can't really recommend this game yet but hopefully the updates will keep coming and it will get better

The mix with the Puppets (Zombies) and the walking Mechs on military loot sites is one of the most horrifying thing that I have experienced in my entire life and I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Amnesia. the element of learning the mechs patterns while also avoiding zombies or luring them in 1 by 1 and killing them silently with melee weapons and also to place the cherry on the top	 trying to avoid/kill players while still surviving the puppets and the mechs. Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ it is amazingly horrifying. Now The zombies are what you expect they are zombies. You shooty shooty with a gun then they comy comy with a horde. What I am trying to say is if you shoot then every zombie nearby will come which actually isn't that much I shot once in the woods right next to a little town I killed 1 zombie with a simple clean headshot from my ak47 with an ACOG scope. then 2 more zombies came they are ♥♥♥♥ing fast. I thing they have the same speed as you if you sprint. Now you could say then we can just outrun the right? well... you are dead wrong your stamina will be depleted in about 1-2 minutes and then you can't run if you try to jump run just do a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥to your character when your stamina is depleted then say goodbye to your character with a heart attack. Now I have 2 zombies following me	 my stamina is almost empty I run to the town while going by 2-3 mroe zombies the also follow me now I go in a building close the door last second but I see I am just a second late 1 zombie comes in I only have a knife as a melee weapon and as guns I have ak47 and an mp5 the zombie pushes me into the corner I say ♥♥♥♥it I pull out my mp5 and load the zombie with some fresh bullets now that I killed the zombie I am bleeding I patch my self up with a rag then I look at the barred windos atleast 5-6 zombies I shoot them 1 by 1 with my ak then I hear a player running I camp my building loot with my scoped ak47 I see him still running away from me with beginner Scum prisoner clothes I did not shoot him I run out and on a mountan then killed a deer skinned the deer and choped the torso to get some meat then I saw a military bunker I chopeed some bushes to get enough sticks to make a litle camp fire then I put them in my backpack I dodged the mechs and zombies ran on the opend rushed to the bunker door. The mech turned around and then I heard shots I ducked waved jumped but I still got hit 15HP about to bleed out and waiting the bunker door to open. It finally opens I rush inside quickly bandage my self and make a camp inside the bunker put my meat (GAYYYY) in the skewer and cook it while I have some freshly cooked deer meat I enjoy a bottle of water and loot the playThat is just 1 day of ingame Scum I will never forget this moment and I think everyone should make these moments of themselves. So what do i say ?BUY ITTLDR: Perfect game not optimized that well zombies are hard looting is hard game mechanics are beautiful Buy it!"

You can dump a load! Very realistic Many skills Ton of crafting Huge metabolism tab that shows you more than you need to know about your character Events for those of you who get bored of survival easily Working zombies unlike DayZ or ArmA 3 Exile mod Guns do a lot of damage Theres a tracking system so you can track players and animals Fully working digestive system that makes the game very realistic Group system allowing you to spawn close to you group members for 100 FP and many other thingsCons: Hard to join a server because of massive player flooding Hard to find food and ammo A lot of desync Respawning costs FP When you have negative FP you have to wait No backstory When you die your energy doesn't regenerate Robots can sometimes shoot you behind walls due to desync No other means of transport than running Took me like 20 slashes to kill a guy with an axe Movement mechanics are hard to get a hang ofGreat game with huge potention and hours of fun!I rate it 8/10

I had 0 player encounters on a full server with 2 hours of playtime. Don't get me wrong the potential is definitly there if the devs continue to work and better this game	 but right now the crafting is limited/useless (its EA	 i know)	 theres no transport and it would take literally 5 hours to run to each end of the map	 the different attributes/strengths/weaknesses and real life dietary simulation is great but theres just something about it that seems out of place	 could be that so much of it just seems useless and seems like a way to fill the missing gaps in the game currently.Also	 unless you have a I7 1080 setup	 glhf running this smoothly	 memory leak city.Refunding until the game is improved on	 in its current state i wouldn't buy this."

Which is sad.The game is comprised of a vast map that you'll find yourself wandering around in for hours with nothing to do	 terribly basic copy-and-paste zombie enemies	 poorly designed weapons	 robots that will instantly kill you ( But not before phasing through walls in pursuit of you. )	 weird and tacky character management mechanics	 poor animations and controls that make the game feel like a bad console port	 and a lack of motivation to keep you going.- Zombies have choppy animations	 seemingly infinite stamina	 and teleport around during combat. This was by no means a latency issue	 it had everything to do with how they moved around.- You can easily bug out of the map and die! Jump on top of any map asset and there seems to be a fifty-fifty chance of this happening.- There's an unnecessary adundance of character management mechanics that you'll never have any time for. Examples: Teeth count ( ? )	 Vitamin levels	 Mineral levels	 Fat storage	 etc.- You walk around and run everywhere but you'll never have enough stamina to do so. I found myself stopping every fifteen or so seconds when trying to cross fields. And there are no vehicles either.- Usage of ladders and vaulting over fences	 rails	 etc. is really buggy and rather dangerous. Fifty-fifty chance of death again. Be careful when checking out watchtowers.- Character movement feels sluggish	 delayed	 and makes doing anything incredibly annoying. It's not a matter of creative realism either	 it just feels like bad animation rigging.- The servers are dysfunctional	 disconnect you a lot	 and are generally quite horrible.- Singleplayer is way to hollow to be playable. Not like you'll have many player encounters on even a full multiplayer server anyways.- There seems to be severe memory leaks that hinder performance even on higher end systems.- Crafting anything in the game seems hopeless as there are never any materials to craft anything. Loot is also nearly non-existant. Get used to this pop-up: ""No Loot"".- Crafting is pointless as nothing you can craft will actually help you. It's as if the entire crafting system was meant for a completely different game.- The weapons in the game all have the same feel to them	 seem to all do the same amount of damage	 and aren't fun to use. You'll have a lot more fun just flailing your fists around. Which will get you killed one-hundred percent of the time.- If you attract the attention any of the robots	 just let go of the controls-- you're automatically dead. Have you ever played a game where you tried battling an enemy a couple thousand levels above your own? Enough said. If there was such a thing as an ""I just like wandering around doing nothing	 not being able to carry much	 and accomplishing nothing... But oh	 I like drinking toilet water!"" genre of game	 I'd automatically have to give this one a solid 10/10.But there isn't.  So 1/10."

513710	5	0	Battle8111	409	18	1	105.8	August 29	 201	"This review is subject to change depending on how the developers take this game forward. I hope they stick the course with their roadmap and don't get burned out. Also	 this review might not be up-to-date when new features drop or changes are made that don't align with this review. It's a really good game currently wise of its base mechanics and there is so much potential for more features and general things to do in-game.SCUM is an open world	 complex survival game has advanced character customization and management. This can be explained in a video by the developers:https://youtu.be/ycfeP7qZMoEOther videos on the game's features can be found here:https://scumgame.com/enI don't want to really talk about how the features work	 I encourage you watch the videos on mechanics I mention as that will bring context of how they work in general. I am also going to focus only on the things I like or dislike in the game. The rest of the features I didn't mention again can be watched in their videos above. Character CustomizationWhen it comes to the character customization	 it's pretty much solid.Obviously they have more to add when it comes to other skills such motorcycling	 piloting	 archery (stuff that is greyed out)	 ect.	 we will see these features  It's easy to create a character as you please. It can be as balanced as you want or specific-role oriented. This can be useful as they add more features such as advanced doctoring	 advanced cooking	 advanced electronics	 building	 ect. This will really define your beginning character more as then they can have an advantage in a specific field then grow on in in game. Overall	 it's very cool and fair system. I really like that these stats improve over time as you do said tasks. MetabolismThe metabolism mechanic is quite fantastic. I really like that your character has to take in different vitamins	 minerals and nutrients to not only to stay alive	 but to not be crippled in using certain skills	 health regeneration	 stamina	 and ect. This really sold me on the game as it makes it more about surviving than just killing people. Developer Video on Metabolism:https://youtu.be/G8J7N_dQbcsCharacter AwarenessThis is probably my favorite feature of the game. Even though this game is both third and first person	 we see that you cannot corner-cheat in third person; you actually have to use your characters eyes to see within his field of view within his awareness skill. This makes the game fun and balanced in general when it comes to combat. It also forces people to be more self aware and tactical in looking around and being aware of your environment. Game / Server Performance:The game currently runs poorly on most PCs. I have a decent computer with an OC i5-4790k	 GTX 980 TI SC	 and 16gigs of RAM and I still have performance issues. Though most of the time when you launch the game	 it will run fine in single player and small multiplayer servers. On larger servers	 it can run poorly	 especially in areas where there are a lot of players	 NPCs or static entities on most PCs. Other times though I will get better performance outside of these areas. The servers themselves run very poorly and can be reflected friendly or enemy players teleporting all over the place. I know this isn't a connection issue as I play on a server that is NA and I have a good ping with; even on European servers	 the connection with the server can be shaky if there are a lot of people. It seems the servers are not optimized very well to take a lot of players and that connection lag between the client and the server can get you killed in combat. It will also randomly cause disconnects or even the server itself crashing. All of these things will be improved in the future and aren't always an issue. There are some performance guides that help improve client-side performance. I will link one below:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498662204Overall	 this is a very promising game and I love it. I never have liked survival games until SCUM. Not only are the base-mechanics better than most survival games	 but brings fun	 complex and overall enduring gameplay. I just really hope the developers do not get burned out/make poor decisions with the game in the future with new features/changes. Overall	 they have done a great job so far and I will see you in-game SCUM bag!"

Eating in this game isn't just filling your energy bar	 like in other games. You have to have a healthy diet so that you get all the vitamins and minerals that you need. Don't forget that you need sodium	 sugar	 carbs and proteins too! (I challenge you to live on a vegan diet in this game. Let's see how long you survive). In SCUM	 eating isn't just one of your annoying needs that have to be in the game so that the devs can call it a survival game	 eating in itself is a feature that you will spend hours with.The map is vast and beautiful. Sadly	 no vehicles are available yet but are confirmed for the future (even planes). Your character can gain and lose weight based on your activity and diet. You can burn fat and generate muscle mass if you work hard and eat right. Being fat doesn't just change your looks	 it affects your performance heavily.This review will get updated in the future	 but for now	 I already can recommend this game in its current state	 just beware that it has some bugs and server problems like desyncs."

I'm hear to ask and answer the questions that need to be asked about an early access game. Q: is it in a playable state right now? A: Very much so	 the servers are a bit unstable as of this reveiw	 but i've not come across any game breaking bugs	 there is a bit of dysync but not too bad	 it is in a perfectly acceptable state right now given the early time in development. Q: Is it worth its price for what it is right now? A: i would say the price is extremely reasonable!	 yes. it is worth the money for what it is in its current state. Q: is it fun?A: you'll experiance tense PVP	 PVE elements that pose actual threat (many survival games do this wrong and make the only true threat other players) and it's great for taking a chilled out walk through the countryside admiring the games many beautiful veiws. if you need ""set in stone"" objectives to tell you what to do then maybe you'll find youself a bit lost or bored with this game	 but if you enjoy managing your character and setting your own goals you'll have a great time.personally i have alot of fun solo in this game	 however as with most things	 it is indeed much better with some friends.Q: how ""active"" are the develops?A: i've seen very consistant posts on reddit from developers taking in ideas suggested by the community helping people who are ""stuck"" with somthing or just commenting on peoples threads to get involved. while i tend to avoid the steam forums they seem quite community driven	 this can be good and bad as the community will get changes it wants	 but they risk trying to please everyone and getting nowhere	 not that that is actually happening. in the few day's i've owned the game several patches have been pushed foward and i've already noticed significant improvement in an already good game. from what i've observerd they are 100% not the type of developer to sit in the shadows and push a patch or two a year while remaining disconnected from the playerbase. summary: Scum is a very fun	 fairly standard	 survival game with a very reasonable price tag	 you will absolutly get your moneys worth if you choose to buy it in its current state	 IF the developers deliver with their roadmaps and vison of the game it has the potential to be amazing	 if they do not	 it is still very good in its current state. a solid buy."

Once you get some gear	 and food	 there is not much else to do. Sure you can kill the puppets	 but there are so many times that you can do that before it just becomes tedius.

The motion and graphics are enjoyable	 the metabolism system is far too complex and needs to be simplified. I'm eager to see fortifications and some basic structure building	 nothing as asburd as Miscreated. There are enough structures that can just be fortified without having to build ramsackle shanty towns.The players in the game are a mix between absolute cancer and friendly strangers. If you go in to the game solo	 expect to not last very long. Public servers may be better	 and with the recent AntiCheat addition the game is about at a ""tolerable"" level.

If your into playing for 45mins to an hour to get some gear then this is for you! if your into DayZ AT all you will have tone's of fun with this game as it is a fast paste DayZ	 No matter where you spawn there's always a military bunker or some for of loot with in at leaste a 20 min run of you	 the wild life is a very cool asspect and feed's well :)	 if your looking for a game like DayZ with a little bit of arcade asspect i'd pick this up ASAP	 i feel like if they did figure out a sweet spot for PVP soon then they'll have a new big game. Thank you for reading this if it helped you at all like it and if it didnt dislike it. As all ways you guys are more than welcome to add me if you need tips for the game or possibly play with me your more than welcome :) thank you have a GOOD DAY"

There are a lot of things you can do in this game. In one way it is like other survival games in the way that you can craft items	 like improvised backpacks or spears and even swords. There isn't any base building at the moment but to what I know it will definitely be added in the future	 along with fortifying building already premade on the map.In the future	 I hope servers people host will be able to be modified with mods or plugins to make it more fun and enjoyable. Maybe even servers where you can get 1000x so you can really test everything out. I do believe there will be support for this in the future	 or at least I hope.When you play on a server you have to create a character	 you can't play with a character on one server then play with the same one on another server. There are a lot of stats you can edit when first making your character including Weight	 Muscle	 Survival Ability	 Weapon Using and much more. The best thing is that if you choose to be fat when you start off you can change that by altering the way you play in-game to adjust your character. Say you want to be more skinning	 just don't eat as much. It isn't instant it will take more time to change things like this. The loot spawns aren't too bad	 but I do think they should change the time in which the loot respawns in houses after they have been looted. Many lifes ago I went through 20mins of gametime and found nothing because all the houses I found had open doors and everything was looted. I didn't even see anyone there. Normally if you don't get unlucky with everything already being looted you won't go a life without getting some sort of gun. You don't really see guns in houses and you will normally have to go to some sort of outpost to get your ahnds on one.Even walking speed is in-depth	 you are able to change the speed at which you walk/run. You can even change your stance which is another thing I hoped would be in a lot of other games. It makes way for more strategic plays. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498684716There are quite a bit of server issues	 like desync. There is a lot of desync. I can tell more when it comes to this because when playing with a friend I can tell that he is desyncing. When we are running to other places I can see him teleporting everywhere. It kind of ruins the experience since server issues are one of the main things. I'm sure this will be fices in the future.The game doesn't run too good but it isn't too bad at the same time. I spawned in and had seen two houses together when I went over my frames dropped from about 55 to 25. I just changed my resolution down a bit and I was able to play for a long time without any lag and just a tiny amount of lag spikes that lasted for almost no time. It didn't really affect my gameplay and I didn't see too many lag spikes when in a fight or anything like that.When you lower the resolution for some reason it does this	 and I don't think you can fix it:http://prntscr.com/kp1x0uSometimes you will see zombie packs. Most of the times you will see maybe 2 near each other when you are near villages or in the wild	 but when you go near an outpost or something like that you will start seeing packs of like 10 zombies. Believe it or not	 I got blocked by loads of zombies. You can't really move after one hits you so when I got hit by 2 each second I died pretty quick actually you don't have to go off my word I have a screenshot:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498739122You can chop people up which is very nice.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498684851 6/11 This game has a lot of potential to be the best game in its respective category."

Although the freezing/stutter is my main gripe with the game right now	 I've had mroe enjoyment	 and a more pleasurable experience in the past 24 hours with this game than the 4/5 years I've owned and banked on the DayZ standalone improving. I mention this because	 Coming from Arma 2 DayZ into the Standalone. I did not get what I had hoped. But	 the very foundational levels of this game already offer more of the ""Survival Sim"" gameplay and mechanics I hoped for in the standalone.  It's Clunky	 It's rough. And it needs work ~ But for the time being this has become my survival game to play	 because amidst all that	 It's still fun. And I look forward to seeing how it develops.  Fix the stutter/freeze issues. blow out the crafting system a little more and solidify the persistant world (per server) and you have a very solid game with room for A LOT of growth."

513710	3	0	magicznymichau	138	5	1	25.8	August 31	 201	"[Early Access Review	 01.09.2018	 it is a message to developers for the most part]Definitely the best and most advanced survival game out there. There is so much content and so many things you have to take into consideration while playing it	 that I won't even try to say what I liked about the game so far and what... not necessarily. But for the most part it is hella good	 even during Early Access stage. Imagine if DayZ was actually a good game	 and then it had a baby with PUBG. Well	 that's basically this game. And I love it.There is plenty of room for improvements though. Like	 very important improvements. So let's focus on them:- As for now	 equipment UI is bullsh*t	 it is buggy	 complicated and super-ugly. It will take you several hours to get used to it.- I don't know if any game had worse chests. It is weird how you can move and place every single thing at exact place you want them to be	 except for chests. When you're crafting a chest your character places it random spot near your position	 but it is impossible to move them afterwards. Also	 it took me few minutes to figure out on how to actually use them	 it is probably the worst implemented chest in gaming history. But that doesn't end there. When you actually manage to put something to the chest (which is tricky to figure out)	 it is nearly impossible to find this thing inside	 because chests are using the exact same mechanic as every other thing lying on the ground with something inside	 and the worst part about it is how UI shows it. So you have to scroll and scroll the Vicinity UI until among houndreds of items you find the thing you needed. I hope it is going to be fixed soon	 they just seem like implemented in a hurry. Can you just make chests work like these in Minecraft or something?- I don't know what else... I mean	 overall the worst part about this game so far is how EQ works. I don't even know how to explain everything	 but it's just bad. It is Early Access	 I know and that's why it is acceptable for now	 but it has to be fixed as soon as possible. - Alright	 there is one more thing - Loot. it seems like it's just too harsh or super jerky. While several guarded areas are just goldmines	 some places are completely empty. No food	 no weapons	 ugh there is nearly nothing AT ALL! Only bad quality clothing and rags. Those	 let's say ""secluded"" areas at least should contain food and... just more loot overall. While you're searching those rural houses or even small towns it's just like: nothing	 nothing	 nothing	 t-shirt	 nothin	 nothing	 rags	 nothing	 nothing	 working pants	 nothing	 nothing	 A MELON!	 aaaand then nothing	 nothing	 and nothing... maybe you'll find cat food if you're lucky. But there is no can opener so...- As for stabilty I'm surprised. I expected problems like with PUBG before 1.0 but there is nearly none. For me	 game runs super smooth on Ultra and between 120-150 fps. I was super happy so see almost stable 144fps. There is one problem though	 well two. While game renders buildings nearby it entirely freezes for a second or two. Sometimes (rarely) it abruptly drops frames for a second or even three without specific reason or while UI is up.But I really liked this game. For now	 it is a bit harsh	 just feels like not finished and not balanced yet. But there is plenty of content already and if those and some other problems are going to be fixed	 it is going to be the best survival game ever. Although it probably is already."

Right now the game is alot of running around rather than focusing on the amazing gameplay mechanics that they already implemented into the game	 it is far too difficult to focus on the mechanics and get a very in-depth overview of them when most of your time is spent running around the map to get to the next city. I still recommend it highly in its current state	 why? Because I understand it is EA right now and I know that it is going to change quite a lot in order to improve the existing issues and mechanics; I am not at all concerned about the developers commitment here and they have already patched it quite a bit since release.I look forward to seeing what the future has to offer for SCUM."

Let me tell you	 this game right here is in almost everything already better than those games. Survival elements aro so deep and well made	 map is gorgeus	 PVP is well made and shooting is easy to learn	 hard to master	 just as it should be. I really recommend you this game	 it is very cheap and you will spend a lot of time playing it and you wont get bored of it in a long time."

Having put in close to 2k hours in dayz	 Scum in the first few days have given me more joy than I have had.  Are there issues?  Sure	 all early access games have them.  But for the most part everything consistenly works.  Basic mechanics that were inconsistent in games like dayz work an overwhelming majority of the time here.  Looting is fun also.  Mostly in the towns you will find basic items with the occasional rifle and pistol. You will have to rely on crafting weapons in order to clear out zombies.  The best loot is all in the military zones	 however unlike other survival games this can pose a real challenge.  Not only are military areas overrun by zomibes	 which can be very difficult	 but are patrolled by mechs which makes sneaking around and timing your runs ever more important.   One wrong move and you can be easily trapped for periods of time until you figure how to get out.  This is my favorit part.  Looting high tier loot areas are very challenging and if not careful	 you can die rather easily.  As far as the map goes	 it is big which is good	 however the buildings and areas can be quite boring as everything looks the same	 minus a few buildings.  Games like DayZ and miscreated have much better maps and level design.  I wish their were some bigger towns and more diverse looking buildings.  Probably a big relief is the complex player statuses.  You have to watch everything from you eating	 to drinking and go to the bathroom to empty yourself otherwise risk automatically doing it during times where you need to run for your life.  The Dev response has been outstanding thus far.  4 days into the game and they have release just as many patches making the game a lot better.  It seems they are really motivated and driven to be the best survival game and so far they are on the right path.  A couple of very strong patches	 adding fortification	 more crafting	 along with vehicles and clothing options and we have a sure winner.  So far I love this game and will continue playing it as long as it continues on an upward develpment path."

This game is amazing pure and simple	 especially for an early access title thats been out a few days. updates from devs have happened with more coming soon from the news posts. dont listen to the bad reviews. i have put 31 hours in over 3 days and all i can say is its probably the best survival game i have played. its a lot more fun when playing with friends. (5 of my friends currently in the same server ) map is massive. bit big for being on foot but cars and parts to fix them are in the game so i assume they will be added shortly. i have seen a list of current things both in the game and planned to be in the game ( server admin now ) and all i can say is wow.... there is a lot. the gunplay is great	 especially for early access title. i personally have not come accross to much lag but some servers do have some bad lag issues which im sure will be corrected soon as the devs are pumping out updates quicklyoptimization is still a work in progress since it released 4 days ago this is to be expected.   im running a gtx 1080 ti and i7 8700k and seeing roughly 70 fps at 1440p epic settings so its not terrible but not the bestthe only real issue i have had with the game is when i tried to change to 4k the game locked up and was stuck on a tent loading screen even after restarts of game	 steam and pc. in the end i had to fresh install windows to fix it but i had planned to do that anyway ready for my 2080ti arriving soon	 so was not an issue for me though it would be a big issue for others im sure.  lets not for get the fact you can lay cable and♥♥♥♥♥♥on your friends tent is hilarious and matched with the metabolism mechanics in the game making you think about your health as you would in real life is a nice touch and takes the game above other survival games.the zombies and mechs are annoying sometimes	 mech are far to overpowered and pretty useless in my opinion. npc soldier we could fight would be much better then massive mechs roaming around. the pvp event modes are great to balance the game and give players a break from exploring and looting. they should just add an outside mode for multiplayer pvp matchmaking along with the indiviual server events pvp overall this game though still in early acess is a great buy at £15 ( $20 ) i have brought it for a few of my friends and now have my own server. dont listen to the negative reviews	 they either dont understand the game and the metabolisim mechanics	 have complete potato pc/ internet and struggle to run the game/ maintin decent ping  our server ip 176.57.178.69:28002discord https://discord.gg/C5z8Sbr"

Running simulators get old real quick. Lets have bikes	 cars and small heli's. And finally 3	 which I know can and will get fixed down the line but the lag	 players teleporting and rubberbanding make melee and gun play difficult. However with all this said	 I've had some serious fun playing the last 40 hrs	 would like to spend more time in the game and I will continue to support the Dev's	 we need more games like this."

If you only care about the ""survival"" aspect of the game then it's a no brainer	 and if you have a partner to explore with	 it'll be more fun for sure.  The crafting	 harvesting	 exploring	 and managing your diet and supplies are impressive- smart systems really well thought out	 if still unfinished.  The world is fun and huge	 detailed and beautiful.My concern is that there are so many time-consuming promises being made about the full game	 I don't know what game it wants to be.  There aren't many pvp events even on busy servers.  The maps are so huge it can't really be about open-world pvp.  The systems seem like they could be really challenging if there were short-term or long-term goals but there aren't beyond gear-up	 and make a shelter and box.  Hopefully the devs are hiring up and thinking about how to plug in content	 missions	 side quests for special gear	 daily goals	 endgame of any kind	 forced encounters with other players- just something to do after the first 6-8 hours.If it mostly stays as it is for the next few weeks	 and no real content is added then they're going to lose people bigly.Hopefully they get some writers working on these amazing story ideas so they matter in the world- give us a massive conspiracy about Tec1 and the govt	 with documents all over the map with clues	 or pieces of tech	 or keys- something	 anything!"

When you finish customizing your character (which only takes 5 minutes at most) the game puts you right into the world with a prisoners outfit and no supplies. This is highly expected of a survival simulator. At first glance	 the world is highly detailed and when you find your first house you get excited. But	 after 2 hours of gameplay I quickly found that supplies are way to hard to find and your body stats drop too quickly. Houses and other buildings are too scattered as you have to run for miles just to be dissapointed and most likely die because your stats fall too quick. The zombies (puppets) are way too hard to fight. Like I said	 the game starts you off with NO supplies and you must fight with your fists. Your punches are too slow and you will most likely die. The zombies are very fast runners as well. All of this wouldn't be a problem if you had actual cities to explore and didn't have to run through the open country constantly. I know youtubers make the game look easy but thats the point.. to get you to buy the game. I really wanted to like it	 but it's a hype-train just like No Man's Sky was when I first came out. There are way better survival games out there for slightly more or the same amount of money. I understant it's early access. I just feel that they spent so much time making the menus look good that the developers overlooked the world and how/where things are placed. It'll be great one day	 just way too early in development at the moment. I found myself running constantly to find places or supplies. It fely like a running simulator and not a survival simulator. I streamed it to youtube for my buddy to watch while I played and he said the same thing. The map is useless because you don't have a marker telling you where you are.

First Impressions So	 I have been following this game leading up to the release and when I very first heard about it	 I was instantly behind it. It was just something about the way they advertised it and how they took an existing genre of gaming(and my favorite genre)	 Survival	 but put a sorta twist on it	 something that maybe has been attempted before(The Culling)	 but done and executed in a way better style. The developers must have grinded every day just about till release	 because I will say this is the most in-depth EA(Early Access	 not that god awful	 cancerous company.) Game I have ever bought	 oh and not to mention	 that $20 price tag is MORE than worth it	 If i were you	 if you don't already have the game	 snatch it now before that increases. To be such an early game	 but to have so much content from the jump is incredible and makes me definitely look forward to what will come in the future updates. At first	 I get a sorta nostalgic DayZ feel	 but as I continued playing	 I realized that it definitely was NOT DayZ. From the ""Puppets"" to the quite advanced health system and shallowish crafting to the overall feel	 this game is going to be amazing	 more amazing than it already is in the future development. If you're looking for a challenging	 but not Dead Souls	 like controller through the wall type♥♥♥♥♥♥  but is still fun	 this is the game for you	 I highly recommend it even in its current state. What I would like to see. I have a small-ish list of things I would love to see	 (but is probably already planned)	 in the game for the future. My List goes:Base Building (I'm sure this is already planned.)Addictions	 (So	 say if you put something like ciggs or alcohol into the game	 if you ingest X amount	 you become addicted and can suffer from withdrawl without.) That may seem like a lot	 but this game is the perfect one for something like that.Better Spawning	 like getting rid of the fame OR making fame collect a hair faster.Modded Servers	 I know this one is a stretch and will take a lot to be implemented	 but its just something I would eventually like to see.A 'Friends' tab on the Server browser for easier connections with friends.Better Squads system	 like make it to where you can invite people from the server list instead of having to meet up and what not.That's honestly it for now	 the other things are definitely coming soon to the game	 like vehicles	 more skills etc.  Wrap-Up Overall	 I would definitely recommend this game	 especially if youre for supporting Early Access games	 this is a great developer team and I see them doing big things with this game. The current state of the game	 as is	 i'd personally give it a 6/10	 due to it being early access and not the complete game yet. I already know it'll be up at a 10 before th year is even over if they keep on the current developer speed."

My reason for writing this review is not to slam the game but hopefully the devs read this and fix it. WHERE ARE THE ANIMALS! The map is awesome but there isn't rarely any beast to hunt. Just feels absent with out them.SPENDING MORE TIME LOOKING FOR FOOD! We have this hard core mod with stats and that's cool but I spend more time looking for food than I do enjoying other parts of the game. It get old real fast.CRAFTING! This is honestly the worst looking craft system I have seen in any game. I buy most survival games that come out and most of the time I buy them on day one. Played Ark on day one. These devs need to fix this because it looks stupid.COMBAT! Im a karate teacher and I love me some ninjas I purposely do not use guns in games and I push my stats to do hand to hand combat and I love seeing swords and bows in games because I train with them reg in real life. WHERE ARE THE BOWS! And the hand to hand combat in very weak in this game. This is 2018 guys!SLEEP! Please are a rest mod in the game. I mean you added in♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥mod so how about rest to regain stam and light healing.Other than that Im pretty much enjoying this game but I think I need to maybe play some of the other mmo survival games for a few and check back when they fix these problems.

From the current state of development I can say:Pros:- Superb graphics and environment- Very high survival aspects- You can craft and survive just with stuff found in nature (besides there is also towns and loot)- PvP/PvE experience- The map is f*cking huge!Cons:- Anti-Cheat protection highly needed (not spotted a hacker yet	 but I've read about it)- Crafting has to be slightly improved. Sometimes it is not clearly why an item cannot be crafted. Still let the player learn and find out but remove any bugs.- The crafts that are being placed on ground like campfire or boxes	 it would be great if those can be moved later- Zombies can glitch/hit through wallsIf the developers build in the features they mentioned (base building	 vehicles	 more crafting and features) then you got me  for years in that game.

This is 2-3 days after EA release so I do not expect them to full launch with everything tomorrow	 but	 seeing how much potential this game has and having to wait for it to all release rough. In its current state the game is fun	 and you will easily get 10+ hours of enjoyment out of it. With friends you can probably hit 20+	 after that it is hard to say. Still working my way there. The biggest issue in its current state is all that is currently planned to be released in the future has not come yet. You cannot build a base / walls or lock chests to fully secure loot so you're left with hiding things in hopes no one finds it. The map is so incredibly large it is very unlikely they will	 but I'd prefer fortifying in some way. In the 18 hours I currently have in the game I have run into 3 people. This is not due to a low pop server	 it is due to the map being so large. There is plans for vehicles to get around faster which would likely fix this but as it stands playing on an official server is very close to playing solo from my perspective due to the infrequency of seeing others. TLDR: Great base of a game	 but the rest of it needs to be released to be a full game. Would recommend buying it but you need to understand it will take some time. The current state is worth the price tag	 and it will only get better with time."

I purchased this game mainly for the PVE single player experience so keep in mind that PVP has some issues for now as the servers are very busy.Performance wise it's doing well. My PC is a bit below the minimum recommended however I can keep it on 1080p 60fps medium/low and it looks decent.Mechanics wise it's absolutely wonderful. I love the complex body management where you can micro manage your guy. This is my dream survival experience. (It's what I purchased DayZ for before it turned into KOS PVP game).The price is very good for what is offered. I hope the devs will be encouraged by the success this game already seems to have and give it their best.In conclusion	I hope this is the DayZ killer everyone is dreaming of"

SCUM is where DayZ wishes it was	 and possibly where it could have headed if they kept progression up- but it's important to recognise this game is only days since full release	 beating DayZ on most points	 forgiving the small bugs because it's Early Access and that's the point of an EA -these things need to be accepted	 the bugs that do exist are FAR from game breaking. The UI is good	 the weight/carry system is good	 everything ties in nicely with the health of your character	 so much of this game is keeping your character in shape to play the way you want to play; roughly 40% of the character can be customised at present	 and the rest when they come will only be an improvement; every players character will be slightly different	 customised to the way that player wants to play	 team play will be improved with different members boosting different stats to help the team as a whole. Character control may seem sluggish at first but won't be noticeable over time	 its just the feel of the game	 gun mechanics so far seem spot on for this stage of development	 the zombies aka puppets are a small challenge	 melee is unforgiving - if you're expecting a COD knife strike you will die; dodging	 blocking	 and landing hits are the name of the game	 and these ""zeds"" wont fall unless you really	 really make them. The AI sentries (walking bipedal tanks) are to be avoided	 especially early on- unless you want to go balls-out with a death wish you will have to ninja around behind them. Alot of survival games miss an ""end game"" when you're geared up	 what then? from the sounds of this game there will be a solid storyline with an ending for anyone who can juggle their health stats while managing to creep and loot up long enough to make it that far"

( singleplayer is not wiped )... hopefully this will change very soon. I am awere thegame is early access	 but at least warn people if this is a regular thing then people dont waste allot of houres playing and collecting things in vain every time.Can i recommend this game yes/NOTruth is the game is beautifull and have a huge map and many nice features	 but it fast become a bit boring since you very rather fast and easy can get the best gear	 just loot a militarybase/prison or something like that and you get the best gear after less than 15-20 minutes of playing...Your player is very advance and there is tons of informations about everything from your vitamin levels to how much pee you have in your bladder	 all though i really dont se any usage for the vitamin part it just feel kind of dumb among other monitoring things that feel kind of to much and useless information.But the part about your clothing being wet and effect what you do and so on are really well done and nice that it make you cold and drain you from enevery and so on. So far so good it feel like a dayz kind of game.But it still have a long time to go since and need some tweaking and much more content.There is not that much you can craft and things you can craft are weaker and worse than what you can find in the game world.Example you can cut down a tree and make boards but cannot use it to build anything such other than a box.And so far i only played 25 houres	 but all of them i where running arround	 and everycity is different but the loot is more or less the same ""random"" stuff. its okay just saying that after a while the game start to look much the same with no real goal or aim for anything..You really only visit the citys to get food	 and find stuff you can use for crafting.Truth is if you just run to the nearest army base and infiltrate it and loot things	 then you get the best weapons very fast	 and you also get the best gear fast...After this do this 1-2-3 times and you have the best of the best gear and then there are 0 reason to really do that again and you can just focus on surviving cooking food and maybe if you like try to find other players you can shoot.if you want to survive just kill a zoombie and chup it up and cook the meet on a fireplace somewhere on the map.. now you can surive more or less forever that way with 0 reason to go anywhere other than to get a little more nice sweater or other stuff.. just saying yes you can go and find hand grenades and rifles and gear and stuff... but i just dont see any reason why i should spend many houres doing so since there are no real goal other than survive and i can just camp somwhere and cook food and survive that way with no reason to risk my neck for anything.I understand the game is in early access and many features and content are missing...Just saying at the current state its a walking/running simualtor where you pretty much never see any other players since there are maybe only 64 on a 144km2 huge map ( and there might only be like 15-20 online at one time due to not everyone being online eveyr day at xx time )   and there are a few zoombies in every city that really are no challenge to sneek past :)  I think the game can be great	 and my advice is to maybe buy it cheap now and try it.. but it might be better to wait example 1 year and first play once more content are avaliable.Right now you can try the functions and learn how to play	 but expect savegames to be reset where you loose everything.In the future they will implement a kind of ""story/mission"" system where you by completing missions now and then can advance and the end game prize will be a ticket off the prison island. But for now you just run  arround and can easy survive with not real meaning or goal. It dosent matter if you sit in a bush 24/7 and only have wood spears and a stone knife vs having the very best gear.Not at bad game	 just saying right now its a bit empty that many might find boring after a few houres with no goal to achive other than eating to stay alive.ps.. game also have some kind of team deathmatch missions where you can go and capture the flag kind of thing and see some action and then jump back and forth to this inbetween your own game and competitions if you desire. This are an extra feature that you can choose to be part of if you like	 but you can also totaly ignore it if you just want to play in the openworld map... These kind of events will however earn you allot of fame and you can either loose or win big on gear by playing these events.But again there really are no reason at the moment to do so other than experiencing pvp combat and action..... you can with very little risk just in the ordinary game world just shoot zoombies and get 3 fame points for every zoombie you kill	 and advance and become famous that way with very little risk of loosing your life or gear."

Firstly	 it needs to be optimized more. The FPS is bad and frame drops are happening often(if you follow the FPS guide	 performance will be better but graphics will be lowered). The game needs an Anti-Cheat	 hacks are already made and people say that hackers are everywhere in official servers	 but I haven't encountered any yet. There is a bit of lag and desync which make shooting hard. Other than that the game is amazing.EDIT: Anti-Cheat has been added with the new patch"

It's not like Rust	 where you get to build a base	 raid others	 and get loot. But I'm not going to compare Rust and Scum	 I was just giving an example	 since these are two separate games. Scum is a running simulator. It's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥to figure out what every little stat means or do. Servers lag like hell. Playing in 4K will make the game too big	 and you'll have to enter custom start-up commands for the game on Steam in order to get it to work. FPS drops. You can't climb a ladder if you have a gun equipped	 and you don't have a holster for it. Just put it in your damn pocket or waist-strap or something. Lastly	 it's just so damn repetitive.

Crashes now and then	 some graphic issues and bugs are to be expected considering this is EA atm. People who complain on performance are partially true and right. The game is not optimized and the options do not let you to drop the graphic quality down enough so you can get higher fps. I am using 1080ti and 8700k on 5ghz and the performance is not that great tbh. There are memory leaks where the game becomes slower as you play. Devs NEED to adress this issue	 and give some more graphic options that could potentially give the gpu and/or cpu some relief to increase the fps. Online games that are competitive need to be ran on higher fps	 if you have higher rr monitor	 like I do. I'm running 1440p at 144hz	 and fps is mostly around 80	 and that is not enough for me. So I'd like to have the option to reduce graphic quality to gain more fps. Do this devs	 my homies. Greetings from Croatia!"

So if you have never played a hard core survival game beware.   I love the fact you can take a crap on a guys chest. So if you have a poo and fetish then you will enjoy that aspect. I have no doubt the developers plan on adding a plethora of fixes and new features.  The main issues I have with the game at this moment are the poor optimization	 FPS issues	 and random disconnect. I also think they should have made us aware the streamers had high end PCs with 8700k's and 1080ti's.  Not all of us can afford that. I hope they plan on fixing the game so people with lower end PC's will be able to enjoy the game as well.  To sum up	 I would recommend the game knowing its in early access and has issues which will hopefully be addressed"

513710	6	0	ZachFett	351	57	1	27.4	August 30	 201	"Already has more content than DayZ	 H1Z1	 and other similar games that have been out for years. It's very obviously taken inspiration from other games like DayZ and ARMA. If you've played those then you'll be able to jump into this pretty easily. Like in the ARMA series there's a good amount of depth to weapons	 which I always appreciate. For example	 you have to load individual bullets into weapons if you don't have magazines for them. Thought that was a nice touch.The game has a lot of in-depth systems	 other than just weapons. You have to watch your calorie intake	 you can get sick and have diarrhea	 and you can even overdose on meds.I'm more of a PvE gamer and I'm pretty satisfied so far with what I'm seeing in SCUM. As far as NPCs go	 there's mechs guarding areas with good loot (bunkers	 military bases	 etc.)	 zombies roaming around everywhere (with pretty decent AI. A million times better than DayZ's zombies)	 and then there's animals like bears	 goats	 horses	 boar	 and deer (according to the devs on the forum there are many more I just haven't seen	 like wolves	 rabbits	 and donkeys). Their road map shows that they plan to add even more animals in the near future	 along with a lot of other major features like vehicles	 safe zones	 and female characters.It is Early Access	 however. If you can't stand glitches you may want to wait a while	 obviously. I haven't run into anything too major	 other than a single crash to main menu and two zombies being able to glitch through a wall while chasing me. Personally I don't think that's too bad for 6 hours of playtime.I definitely think it's worth $20 and I've barely scratched the surface of this game. The map is huge with tons of points of interest	 there's the whole PvP side I haven't really touched	 and I haven't played with friends yet	 which I'm sure will be a lot of fun.I should also mention that you can play deathmatch/team deathmatch modes rather than just doing the main survival mode if you're into that kind of thing!"

For a first day release with a lot of players servers were not bad and they added lots of information on your characters and the health of your character. The animations are really good and once they add a few more base crafting items and add cars the game will be one of the best survival games on the market. They made it hard to loot compounds (yes the robots could use a nerf) but besides that the looting is not to bad and they could nerf the time it takes you to wake up after passing out drunk	 I was out for 20 minutes till i got my friend just to shoot me so I could respawn instead of waiting. They could add a way to make groups in game and a way to zoom in on the map as well as mark locations. They could also make the map feel a little less empty because you could end up running in a field for a good 5 minutes before you find a building. They also need to add seed to the game so you can make your own garden. The game still has so much to release within the next few updates."

However the game does feel kind of pointless... Why am I surviving? Is this satisfying? I cant wait for the content to be more fully finished. Some things id love to see that would really seal the deal on this game for me are:- More craftable items	 nomadic items like fishing rods and bows would be amazing.- Base building / loot storage and fortification (maybe capture and hold certain areas/towns? think turf wars...)- Better RPG elements (currently leveling up skills is not worth the time) - some users have suggested INT for understanding items better	 how about leveling other skills faster?? i.e a fat smart crim can skill up 2-10x faster than a dumb buff crim.- Dont make this game easier... simply make it more rewarding and open ended for those prepared to commit and to excel at survival.​- Better animal tracking/higher spawns (maybe use the focus ability to show old poop/tracks so you know your within the 'spwan/roam' area of a creature to hunt (maybe require lvl2/3 survival to do this??)For now the learning curve is steep... learning to manage loot and to simply survive is a challenge however give it a few hours and you will have the basics under control. There really isnt much depth beyond this yet though - consider this game a survival sandbox"

Not a whole lot to do when you get geared	 etc. I used to run one of the most populated Lingor Island servers in the US at one time. The A2 mod had its issues just like this game. This game has that chance to take over if they don't jack it all up.Runs good so far on 1080Ti/8700K/4.7all core on H100i @ 1440P The ""nothing found"" is pretty lame when you loot a whole small town and find nothing but maybe some nails. Ran around for about an hour killin zeds with a shovel	 good times. It has some wonky ""lock on"" camera thing when you melee attack. This needs fixed. Take DayZ	 A3 Exile	 The Stone Cold Steve Austin movie ""The Condemned""	 and Rust and you have SCUM. This game has lots of potential.

You have to worry about vitamins	 bladder	 you cant really get away from zombies when they catch onto you. (They are fast and can hit you through walls and doors	 but you cant hit them) fighting them isnt too bad as long as you hit and move because they hit faster than you do. crafting is simple (As in you click the item you want to craft and it tells you what you need	 and you just need it nearby). There are some team things that i havent checked out yet (You pick a team red or blue) and as you do things or kill enemy players you get rep points and so far the only thing i have noticed is you can spend some when you die to spawn at your base	 or next to a squadmate"

Last one I played I think was like Fortnite. *shudders* Anyway SCUM is amazing. The graphics are so well done even on low that it feels like you are actually on this island. It pulls you in in a good emmersive way but does make you loose all track of time. We've had 8 & 9 hour sessions. Sadly have to get some sleep before work. Got to keep bills payed. Anyway if you are looking for a great game then get this. You won't regret it. I just can't wait for the female characters. As a woman I prefer playing females and running around with dangly bits always bothered me. This time	 not so much. Still want to be a woman though.

I was really bummed out since I hardly knew any other MMO's that were not trash or abandoned. So I saw that SCUM was just released and I thought ""oh why not	 it's only twenty bucks"" And wow	 for a game that just released.. I was impressed. Not only that	 but single player mode so I can actually feel around the game without some r3dneck's screaming in my ear while driving pick-up trucks to do some drive by's. I recomend this game but if you want a OPTIMIZED game	 then I would wait a little longer. There is some few FPS drops but not as bad as most games I played."

513710	1	0	ItsWhiplash	86	3	1	69.4	August 29	 201	"If you're going off this game by the ""Mixed"" reviews then hear me out.  Why The Game Mainly Has Mixed Reviews In My Opinion 1. Servers were messed up on the first few days. Meaning if you went into the server browser you couldn't find a server to join. This possibly still occurs	 but less likely than likely. The best way to solve this problem is by going to  Battlemetrics  and just getting the IP from there and join the server. So problem solved.2. People sometimes expect a ""full"" game rather than what the game actually is now. Currently	 the game is in a great state for being in early access and it provides enough features to keep you interested for the $20 title. Eventually	 this game will become $60; but this is in the far future	 so you have time to make a decision. 3. Hackers were a big problem and sorta still are. Saying this	 you won't run into a hacker on every server. Just a few. This is avoidable by joining the right custom server because admins are on most of the time. After the devs released the patch for EaC (Easy Anti-Cheat) I haven't ran across any. Why You Should Buy In My Opinion As stated above	 there are a few minor complications with the game. It's not like you're buying a piece of trash that can't be refunded. Play for an hour; and if you like it	 keep playing. If you don't	 then get your money back.All in all	 the developers  listen to the community	 so your opinion matters. This is one of the main reasons of why I recommend this game. The first few days	 the devs released a system to fight hackers	 added better server optimization/lag fixes	 and have been working constantly to better the game. You can't ask for much more than that.Finally	 this game has much to grow into. There is so much potential for this game. For example	 vehicles	 new gear	 new areas to loot	 and many other concepts to make this game a masterpiece. ✦If you enjoyed games like Arma 2: DayZ Mod or Arma 3 Exile Mod	 then you will fall in love with this game. Just give it a try and see how it feels."

The game is so new I figure you would start with a lot of drops so people could learn the crafting system then slowly take them away. I didn't find enough similar items close together to craft anything	 once I set something down I need it 10 minutes later. Backpacks are abysmal. After you use your med pack from the first zombie and you get knicked by another zombie it's like 15-20 minutes to the next town.Conclusion: The game is rough but I supported this developer because they might do this game right and bring us the DayZ that never was?I will re-review the game again in a few weeks."

I've been tracking the development on this game for well over a year now and naturally have been eagerly awaiting Early Access to launch on Steam now for most of the summer. Yesterday that finally happened and I have to say that on the whole I am very pleasantly surprised!I am a massive fan of survival games	 even if I have become a bit fatigued with the constant stream of them over the last five years or so. But nevertheless	 when Scum went live yesterday	 I managed to get in just over 6 hours of gaming on it	 both offline/single player and online with friends. I will say this review is perhaps a little premature in that respect as there’s still so much for me to find out about the game – actually that’s the first thing to note	 there is  a LOT of content and a lot of game for an Early Access title . Much more than I expected and although there are bugs and issues (Early Access!)	 there’s actually a lot less than I expected.Things that have impressed me so far:-	Single player mode/standalone (great way for players to learn and to sandbox)-	Smooth gameplay. The game runs relatively smoothly and very well even on my older system! There is some kind of memory leak bug that leads to FPS drops the longer you play presently but I expect that fixed soon. A quick game restart sorts it out anyway.-	Lots of servers! Official regional servers are great!-	Atmosphere and tone (It perfectly recaptures and represents the old Day Z feel but also adds some humour to it in places)-	Content (Theres lots of loot and weapon and gear)-	Body/Metabolism systems (Theres already a  lot of stuff in there in relation to the way your characters body works	 but if you’re no into all that you can easily play without paying too much attention to it)-	Map (The map is a good size considering these no vehicles yet – big enough to explore and get space	 yet also reasonably spaced to easily find friends and get where you want to be relatively quickly. It also looks lovely!)-	Hand to hand combat is pretty good but does need some further refinement-	Inventory system (very similar to Arma2/Escape from tarkov!)-	AI (enough AI antagonists to keep you on your toes and despite bugs like warping	 pathing	 not being able to open doors etc. they’re still a genuine threat)-	Crafting (this is where the game excels	 survivalists will cream themselves over this!)-	There is a  match system in game that I admittedly haven’t used yet but looks good!Bad things -	There are bugs and glitches	 frustrating t times true. If this pisses you off	 maybe wait to play till a few versions in.-	A bit early to moan but no instant join on friends for multiplayer an the sever browser system isn’t working very well (at time of writing) as its difficult to find friends. Overall	 this is everything Day Z should have been. Is it too late though? Nah	 it’s an amazing game with so much potential. The devs have delivered a game Early Access that already knocks the socks off most rival games in the genre. Its exciting to think of how good this could actually be 6-12 months down the line! So far I’d say its more than worth the money!"

The world looks amazing the gameplay is somewhat intuitive and the learning curve is easy enough to survive but steep enough to pose a challenge. I'm yet to come across real players in-game	 though I have killed a few zombies and managed to outsmart the walking robot death machines when ive come across them in the military zone.The stats screen that shows you how your player is surviving and caloric intake etc. seems a bit daunting at the moment	 though I feel with further play and practice it will all make sense. I'm still somewhat unsure as to how to utilize these stats at the moment	 or even how popularity works	 but I'm having fun nonetheless.There is still alot of work to do in this game - more items and vehicles are a must	 some polish on the mechanics and fluidity of some fights and maybe more interactions to remove the feel of emptiness would be appreciated.So far I would rate this game a solid 9/10 for it's current development state - solid idea	 great execution and amazing potential in the future. It is definitely worth a shot."

DON'T BUY IT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO BE A PRODUCTIVE PART OF THE GAME'S DEVELOPMENT: The game has a lot of potential and adds a lot of things to the survival sandbox genre that we haven't seen before. Yes	 it does feel somewhat generic in certain areas right now	 but that's because those parts of the game aren't finished. I mean it says that in huge letters on your screen every time you load in sooooo.....if you're going to trash the game maybe learn how to read instead? Anyways	 most of the bad reviews were written by people with 1 hour or less of gameplay	 so that haven't even put enough time into it to experience it all and therefore their opinions are invalid. Buy the game. Enjoy the game. Share your thoughts on where it can improve with the devs. Watch it grow. Don't whine like a b****. Pretty simple stuff there."

So i know when im being bs'd	 and i have waited the ""years"" these game take lmao.1. Every early review or gameplay was literally paid promotion	 i seen barely any videos with someone expressing their thoughts and concerns being unpurchased by the developers. 2. The whole game was hyped on the survival systems and their depth. Vitamins	 Minerals have no clear effect at all and the other half of the systems are completely negligable.3. God did this game sh!t the bed on server performance and overall optimization. The game lags when loading new chunks	 and runs 30-40 FPS on halfway decent computers and sometimes even expensive builds. Also anyone remotely running in the distance is impossible to hit when they're lagging all the ♥♥♥♥ over. nice netcode guys	 its like a freshman in college wrote the ♥♥♥♥ing thing  4. Didnt implement anything other survival games did; (no base bulding	 no cars	 no persistence so any storage you do have just gets deleted when you leave) like what is this game. the entire end game is kill everything that moves	 you might as well play tarkov at this point because it actually has tactics and is objectively better and way more efforted in gunplay. oh and you can keep your sh!t you found or killed for. 5. Server renting	 like seriously. Every survival game that has ever had it always does some sort of scummy♥♥♥♥♥♥ DayZ servers were overpriced	 miscreated the developers literally have friends that work for the provider. We bought your god damn unfinished game can you at least appreciate that. Anyone renting a server is basically paying for the full price for the game in a sense. Seems like a nice way to get your full $60 even if your game flops	 hmm interesting how that works. You might as well buy Tarkov instead of this♥♥♥♥♥♥game if you want actual good PVP. This game is literally that but with useless♥♥♥♥♥survival systems cranked to the max	 and Jank gunplay. Its like the hype of this game was completely sold on the survival systems to make it look more polished than DayZ	 except when half of them are completely negligable or work unrealisticly like hunger. Game is awesome if you want a pooping and peeing simulator	 which is literally like half of the content in videos of this game	 everyone pooping and peeing on eachother and laughing gets hilariously old after 5 minutes. Thats about the only time ive seen people actually smiling playing this game like lmao. My personal gripes: 1. There is like no long distance gunplay at all	 scopes zoom in like ♥♥♥♥ing 2cm	 2. everything in the distance looks washed out and blurry because the games horrible depth of field3. All you do is roam and kill	 with♥♥♥♥♥♥gunplay and server performance. PLAY TARKOV INSTEAD IT ACTUALLY DOES IT RIGHT. 4. You cant zoom in on the map	 like why. its difficult sometimes telling your partners where you are at when everything is 2cm across and zoomed all the way out. so you cant even see any map detail. most of the time i met with my friends we used bends and loops in roads just to find eachother. No like coordinates either	 which would solve finding anyone. 5. Gunplay is so ♥♥♥♥ing stiff	 its like your gun has a cinderblock attached to the bottom. 6. survive the nights gimmick	 search every drawer and desk till it becomes absolutely tedious. miscreated god forbid did this right in hiding loot around houses so you get the search factor. Rather than just run in and look on the ground. Finally	 everyone saying ""you have no right to judge this game	 wait for it and give it a couple weeks to month"" ""its unfinished so go easy"" i paid ♥♥♥♥ing money for this game	 why do i have to keep my mouth shut. its another thing if its free	 but this game is $20 and $30 with a supporter pack and it already has a DLC section which is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Buy this game if you want to laugh for about 20 minutes peeing and pooping on everyone	 get bored to tears running across the map and finding♥♥♥♥♥♥that is no use or you will just lose because you straved to death. Dont mind running	 looting	 dying and repeating without the ability to even save anything. Frequent server crashes	 and character being wiped after it happens or set back. Want to go to the same two areas (airfield	 prison) for anything even remotely good. character customization that gives everyone the same four faces and skills that arent even described what they do or have no visible effect on gameplay at all.boy do i gotta give it to the devs	 they played it brilliantly. they understand every survival game ever is not purchased on 'potential' like all you idiots say or unique gameplay experiences. They are sold on apparent polish and overhype. Thats about the only positive things i have to say to the devs. if you wanna starve most of the time you play	 go ahead and buy it. Unfortunately im stuck with this♥♥♥♥♥♥game	 so we'll see if this review changes.How many generations of survival game players are going to get bs'd and ♥♥♥♥ed over till they finally realize it? one last thing	 if anyone can correct me if im wrong. the skills in character customization were all there in the early reviews and gameplay and now almost all of them are greyed out. did they seriously remove them like lmfao. The only good thing i can say about this game is how fluid the movement is	 thats it. Comments will stay on because im not a puss like everyone critcizing the 'detractors' with their comments off after taking shots. just stop."

Literally the sun would never come up so i was stuck staring at a dark dim filtered screen burning my eyes away	 also wanted to play with my friend	 but the only problem was he would spawn  in damn near another server. On top of that you can go through a whole village and find absolutley nothing just when all you want is a freaking backpack and some water. Game is just terrible DO NOT waste your time. Oh yeah	 dont even try fighting the zombies with your fist or a melee weapon if your strength isnt on a hundred	 because your player will run out of stamina like he ran the mile run after 2 hits. Dont worry though	 if you find a rifle	 YOU WONT find any ammo to go with it so goodluck shooting it.

Made a stone knife and a spear.  Chased down a rabbit	 whacked it	 skinned it	 cut it up and ate it raw.  Made a bone needle too.  Found a zombie.  Beat it	 killed it	 looted and dismembered it.  Didn't risk eating.  More pockets - that's more like it. Found more zombies.  Eventually got killed. To be expected.  Respawned.  Ran around.  Jumped off a cliff to see how respawing works.  Suicided too.  Fame points' kinda funky.  Swam to island.  Found a gun.  Found some church.  Took a dump on the altar.  That felt right.  Found more zombies.  Learned that guns don't come with ammo.  Jumped in lake to swim away.  Fat guy chased me on the bottom.  Died eventually. Multiplayer:Learned to make an axe	 a rope	 a fire.  Killed a zombie	 cooked and ate some. Saw people using text chat and pressed all buttons until found that 'T' is the chat button.  Looted houses	 made a backpack.  Freakin' finally!  Gotta play some more later. There are some things to polish out	 but overall it looks nice and promising.  I get some freezes occasionally	 but considering that my CPU is below the minimum required I can't complain.  Gotta remember that when you use an object (such as eating something) you drop whatever you were holding before and you need to pick it up.  It's hard to see in the grass.  Good there's a 'nearby' section in the inventory."

513710	22	1	shifshifu	356	36	1	72.3	September 2	 201	"Ok basically this is a survival game but not just survival but a complex and very hard survival game where you have to check all your hunger	 stamina	 energy	 and all health details that is called metabolism. It's a huge chart that has every single details of your body. You should maintain that to survive. Other thing ""puppets"" so called zombies are so damn tough	 I suggest to make at least a big stone axe at very start of the game so you can at least kill them with around 5 to 6 shots but just don’t stay in one place and hit them like other games	 you gota hit and run or sprint backwards while attacking. Good lots are very scarce and when you get them when you need it badly specially a huge backpack lol you'll be celebrating a joyful moment. so everything matters. Each and every items will be very useful and when you enter the military base or anything similar the risk of getting killed is very high unless you maintain stealth and make a plan how to avoid zombies and the killer machines. You have to survive and it’s a struggle in this game but achieving something is very rewarding and kinda awesome moment. Other enemy are the rest of the players unless you have a mutual understating and being friend with them or just they'll kill you for your items. What you basically get is a lot of exploring	 searching	 looting	 crafting	 and more killing in a beautiful and huge world. Scum feels like an advanced DayZ. The game has great character depth and gameplay with some beautiful graphics of vegetation	 forest	 landscape	 real feel atmosphere and sound effects and all of  these for a fair price. I'm just hoping for more optimization. So we have tons of things to worry about and stay alive. Mostly this game is very addicting. I love it! According the roadmap of this game it's gona be something really cool. Anyway let's see in future how it goes.  Oh dang	 that bear -_-"

This game isn't for me however and I'll post my experience in the interest of balanced reviews.Pros: Runs very well! Movement mechanics are nice and smooth	 can mantle over pretty much anything nice and easily. Island is huge	 plenty of space to run around and craft/hide/survive. Insane levels of details on metabolism and general health care	 if you're into that sort of thing.Cons: Joined 2 full pop servers	 didn't see a single person in my time running around. Found a big robot in the woods that killed me from a mile away through 4 trees. Killed about 10 zombies with a sledgehammer for seemingly no reward. Found a Rifle and Pistol that only hold a chambered round	 so assumingly you need to craft magazines? That's far too grindy for a game with permadeath.Has huge promise but right now feels like DayZ and PUBG had a baby and doesn't really bring enough originality to a saturated market."

The mechanics of the game are amazing. The metabolism system is very in depth. You have to balance your diet in order to keep your body in prime condition for quick HP recovery	 stamina	 and energy. Crafting is in depth as well	 you need to gather materials from the world to make items. The better the ql of the materials the better ql the finished product. The crafting system is going to expand to include an vast cooking system as well as vehicles. Stealth and camoflauge are used to hide from or sneak past zombies	 mechs	 and other players. Better your equipment	 skills	 and technique the more successful your mission.Silent kills will keep the others from coming to attack you. Making spears from just wood	 to stone tipped	 to metal spears will add to your stealth skills. Game needs bow and arrows	 xbow	 silencers	 and other ways to attack quietly from a distance. The physics of the game are great	  U4 looks amazing. First or 3rd person allows for an incredible experience. The roadmap has loads of upcoming features in version 1.0 and can't wait for it. The current rate of patches is great for a 1 week old EA game. Don't let the negitive reviews keep you away if you like survival games. This one is going to be my next 2500+ hours game.

That said	 it's not great yet. With the addition of fortifications and missions I'd reccommend but no idea when we'll see those.. Currently progression is meaningless and you can be about as effective naked with a pistol as you can be fully geared with an AR and 10 full mags. No real reason to try and gear up everytime when it's not that good and you can't store it safely. So honestly that leaves fame grinding AI or talking to/trolling people and laughing at the bathroom mechanics until that inevitably gets old.I've got hope the devs will stay on track	 so far they're addressing bugfixes and server issues quickly	 but If some basic content like bases and missions aren't in by the end of the year I would uninstall and never reinstall this game.

513710	1	0	76561198116111142	210	10	1	7.5	September 11	 201	"Overall I think SCUM is the innovative Survival PVP game we all wanted. Finding high end loot takes time but is certainly doable with you know where to look and dying is forgiving at times with the fame system. The core gameplay is solid	 the metabolism mechanics are absolutely daunting at first	 but after a few hours it totally makes sense and it's pretty easy to manage. I also appreciate though it does have negetive effects when you don't balance your metabolism properly	 it doesn't completely cripple your character. There's so much potential here and even after 7.5 hours I totally feel like it was worth 20 bucks. That's not to say that this game doesn't have some serious flaws	 but nothing that I don't feel like can be fixed over time. The game has this sort of ""samey"" feel to it. Every town and building is far too similar. The sentrys are insane	 but aren't impossible to kill	 and as long as you're careful	 you can snake right by them. That being said	 I certiainly wouldn't mind a little nerf. I see a lot of people complaining about them but I mean	 really	 if they were easy to get past; every single person would be running around with top end loot. Where's the fun in that? Overall	 in it's current stage I think it's definitely worth the $20 price tag. Obviously the game is far from being finished	 but there's a lot to love here and it will only get better (I hope)."

The map is huge and beautiful	 the theme is unique	 the way you level your character from the build	 to the stats	 to the vitamins and resources you need is incredible. Everything I've seen shows me this game has tons of potential and I want to see it through. Understand that this game is not finished so there will be flaws and bugs which is to be expected	 so I will not rake the game over the coals for it	 because I see its potential. It's fun	 unique	 and I would definitely recommend.Update (9/2/2018	 00:05): A little feedback for the devs	 as if they're going to see this...But	 I digress. Anyway	 I have played a little more and finally got around to finding a water source and killed a boar. Thought everything was going well	 I make a fire	 start cooking the meat on a skewer (or so I thought)	 drink some water and have me a nice little dinner. However	 little did I know I cannot tell if the meat is actually cooked or not. I click ""cook"" on the fire	 and the action occurs	 but there's no indication of whether or not the meat is actually cooked. Now	 I say that because	 assuming that the skewer of meat is cooked	 I just start eating. Well	 after a little while I learn that I become sick	 and my health is at 25%. I had come to the conclusion that it had to be because the meat was not cooked. So	 I keep clicking the cook option on the fire until it disappears	 but	 no indication as to whether or not the meat is actually cooked. So	 becoming desperate because my health is dropping pretty quickly	 I eat some more when the fire stopped giving me the option of ""cook"". Well	 soon after	 I died. This is really a pain	 I was getting along nicely	 I found a backpack and a waist pack and had some nice things to go a long with it. A ton of meat and also a nice water container to last me a while. Being that I died and lost all of that	 it's a little irritating. It's not like I died to an animal or another player or something	 but dying because I'm sick and cannot tell if the meat is cooked or not is a bit troubling. I still like this game	 but there is definitely some stuff that needs to be worked on.Update (9/3/2018	 08:14): I have found that if you eat too much of any such food it can give you an over abundance of specific nutrients. I am way over on all things meat as of now. As I said before	 there really isn't an indication to know if your food is cooked or not	 but	 I can assure you that if you made sure to hit ""cook"" then your food is indeed cooked. Coming to that conclusion	 I believe my problem yesterday was that I simply overgorged myself. I think that's the reason I was so sick and ended up dying. So	 I am looking for more vegetables and whatnot to find that correct balance	 I have more than enough meat for now. So	 if I were to say anything	 just make sure you balance your diet out on the game	 because too much of one thing can become dangerous. This is becoming more of a log/diary than a review	 but	 if it helps just one person	 I would find that to be nice."

It's one of the more polished early access survival titles on launch	 and there's a decent amount of content in it already (for an early access game).As of yet	 there's no end goal so it's mostly DayZ/Rust-style gameplay	 but I'm impressed with the level of detail they put in this game. Some features have not been implemented yet and there are a few minor quirks in it	 so it may not be for everyone in its current state. Biggest issue for me was performance - it runs smoothly most times but stutters when loading in areas and sometimes for no apparent reason	 returns to normal after some time. That said	 if you're not sure if this game's for you	 check back again in the future. It definitely has a lot of potential and the devs are off to a good start so far."

Happens with a lot of highly anticipated games. The servers got overrun. I expected that.  I know they will fix it so I’m not worried about it.  I played some single player instead. I really like this game. I came upon a prison that had mechs everywhere and zombies roaming everywhere. Snuck in. Avoiding the mechs was fun and tense.  Sneaking from building to building.  Look. The game is cool. Runs fine. As soon as the server thing gets worked out and I can try multiplayer I’m going to be very happy with this game. BUY it. It’s going to be so much better than PUBG. Thumbs up from me.

Likely because the game is locked into a closed party deal where server files are not publicised.Rubber banding is frequent. Server crashes is frequent. All issues that can be overcome with publication of server files ;)Map is too big for the average server slotage of 64. The graphical settings don't improve FPS.

513710	1	0	SirSourPuss	65	2	1	39.7	September 10	 201	"SCUM is the game that the multiplayer survival genre deserves	 the game that many survival players have been waiting for without knowing it.On day 1 the game has already managed to win over the hearts of those who were betrayed by the devs of games like DayZ	 Ark and Rust. The survival genre is cursed with sloppy developers and games stuck in early access limbo	 forever buggy and unpolished. SCUM plays better on day 1 of early access than most of the other survival games play after spending years in early access. Croteam push out a patch almost every day	 always focusing on the most important issues reported by the SCUM community. This flies in the face of the approach taken by the devs of Rust and Ark who would rather work on pushing out half-baked content that nobody asked for	 adding to the pile of bugs and issues with their games instead of fixing anything.Sure	 there are bugs and issues as with any other early access game	 but the rate at which these are being fixed is setting this game up for a fast release	 perhaps late 2019. When you try other early access games of this type you'll often find yourself thinking 'this has potential	 but it's really broken. I'll come back in a year to see if its any better'	 but then you come back after a year and the game is just as much of a mess	 if not more. So	 what about SCUM? If you don't like it now come back in 2-3 months. It'll be an epic game."

However	 the devs of this game are still working on this game and improving it. That being said	 he some things about the game. This game is really fun! I know most people compare this to DayZ	 but I have to say	 this game is 10x better. Looting is just like any other game	 but it is a little bit easier here. Going to the military bases is probably your best option right now. However	 finding food is really hard. I mean I go into a town and only find a candy bar. There are only I think 6 guns in this game. I hope that they will add a variety of guns in the near future. This game will require a beefy computer. I have a 1060	 and I gai 50-60 FPS on high. There are many lag spikes but	 I pretty sure devs are working on FPS improvements.Overall	 for an early access game	 it is great. I plan on playing this game a lot. For the people that are unsure of buying this game. Watch a couple of videos on guides of the game so that if you buy it	 you will know what to do."

No base building only fortifying of existing structures. Sucks! RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER: ok I can do that. Even though I already returned the game for a refund i have been watching and you guys took measures against hackers. thats good. And since you guys are making a sincere effort to fix it i will change my review. I still want traditional base building in game not fortifying structures and the ability to host my own server. I will then possibly reconsider purchasing the game

Everything about the game is great looking and it runs surprisingly well. Though	 at this stage there really isn't anything at all to do other than gear up to go mindlessly kill other people. Hopefully in the future we'll see some more objectives.(There are death match game modes as well as a capture the objective mode	 but they are separate and serve no purpose other than to have a bit of fun)There is no server filter though.. Which can make finding your friends server absolutely infuriating.But over all It's a good early access game worth the price tag	 I recommend it if you're into PvP survival games."

I usually would not leave a review with so little hrs played unless the game was horrible	 but honestly I'm really liking scum. I'll be honest it's basically dayz but better	 and in few ways not as good	 like no silencers atm (that I know of) no bows atm (in development) (lots of stuff in development) cooking is a bit hard to grasp	 in dayz your food changed color as you look at it	 in scum theres a green health bar that deteriorates as you cook	 and I guess you wan't it half way? I don't really know all I know is if the bars full you get the runs and if its empty you can't eat it because its basically burnt up. There is less role play assets right now. There is stamina in this game which is realistic	 but I really fn hate stamina in running simulation games like this because I don't have 24/7 to play and getting places takes a bit obviously. But in all honesty I can't say I'm really upset with it	 everything is so beautiful and even jogging in this game is enjoyable. Also food in this game is not really a big problem unless you just get super unlucky	 I mean you can make a spear in like 10 seconds and a wooden spear is all you need to kill anything really (excluding bears	 I have never tried a spear on them and I honestly don't have the balls to) If you just spear an animal	 walk up to where you hit it	 track it	 you will be able to see that it has heavy bleeding and it will bleed to death in 3-5 min (time not really shown	 but its never more than a few min in my experience) just follow the blood trails to food	 craft a knife from stones which you can get from the ground literally anywhere and your good	 you can even eat the raw meat at the expense of explosive diarrhea later of course. Animals are not rare like in some games that you play for hundreds of hours and never see one. (cough dayz cough) That is of course if you don't see berries or mushrooms or vegetables that are also everywhere. I like the respawn system in this game assuming the devs don't listen to whiner's and nerf it some how. You can hold f on someone and invite them to group which shows there name over their head. (not sure on the distance) The biggest reason I don't play dayz is because not only does it take forever to find your friends but there is no squad system and when you die your likely to never see them again	 within the next 5-10 hours of course. In this game you get fame points for almost everything which can be used to respawn randomly	 or at a sector on the map	 on friends	 or on a shelter that you have built. Fame points are pretty balanced I think	 you don't get them too quick but then again they don't take forever either. You can farm the events for fame once you get fame to do them	 if you want a lot of points. If you don't have enough to respawn you don't loose your character the points just go negative. Some people would complain that spawning on your friend is op but lets be real.1. If you died to a mech there is a 99.9% chance your not getting your loot back	 mechs are op.2. What threat is a bambi really?3. In a pvp situation unless the dude you didn't kill is rambo with a backpack full of guns your basically good to go.4. If the dude is rambo and your solo and there is now two threats again as the comunity of eft would sayA. This is a squad based game you should have friends	 if you don't oh well.B. Get Gud.My friends have not got the game yet and as is in dayz in this game kos is 99.9% of everyone	 your not making friends in game. I get teamed all the time	 mainly because I'm not an a hole and I never kos but everyone else is an a hole	 so I usually just steer clear of people unless I'm really geared and just wan't to kill someone and in that case I don't need there loot anyway	 I have all I'll ever need. The robots in this game that patrol the military loot zones are op af	 there are many of them and they have eyes in the back of there head and can see thru anything thanks to a buff by the devs. I really hope they tweek the detection on them so you can actually get through the gaps in them and sneek in	 other than that I really like them	 they keep a holes from hogging all the good gear and camping the areas. Obviously the games performance is still rough as it just came out days ago and is in ea. My rig is 5 years old I have an i5 4670 3.4ghz it runs at 3.71ghzGTX660 3gb24GB ramWindows 8.1I had to run the game in windows 8 compatibility mode to get 1920x1080 since my display scale is on 125%. Before It was on 1066x600 on medium settings my high fps was 75 and the game looked a little fuzzy but not bad at all really	 now that I have 1080p fixed The game looks epic even on medium an prolly does on low aswell I just havent tried it	 my high is like 25	 normal is like 10-20 fps but I'm getting a gtx 1080 later so that will fix it. All in all it's a pretty good game so far	 like I said it just came out so there is alot of polish and content to be added	 right now there is not much to do but explore and kill stuff like in dayz but there will be more stuff to do in the future. If you don't like dayz style survival games your not gonna like this prolly	 but if you do I would say you will like this better	 also the zombies in this game are mindless controlled people called puppets and there is no virus so you can eat them. Mmm they taste good. There is no crazy cannibal laugh in this game like dayz though	 kinda saddins me	 the best thing to do in dayz was eat people then run up to a lesser geared player and spike up a conversation and then out of nowhere comes that laugh	 then theres that awkward silence until its broken by the sound of your chainsaw slicing through his body. Good times... good times. Well I had more to say but in writing this long♥♥♥♥♥review I kinda forgot the rest so all I can say is if your interested know it's a good ways from finished	 lots of content to be added	 buy it and if you don't like it within two hours refund it and rebuy it in a year. I love it though. Amazing start for a small dev team in my opinion."

Any game that makes you consider whether you need a dump before you take on a heavily guarded outpost is always going to be a winner.I actually got a hatchet to the back of the head while having a pish. I wasn't even mad.

As the game stands right now	 it is good. It's been out for 2 days and I think it runs better than most games that have been out for way longer than that. If you think you'll get tired of playing the ""looting"" part of the game	 just jump into one of the event modes and have at it! There are some dsync issues in those matches but I come from Escape From Tarkov and it's no where near as bad as that. I highly recommend this game! I have been waiting a long time for this to come out and it has passed my expectations with flying colors! These people saying it has a bad performance issue	 I don't know what they are talking about. The game has run perfectly fine for me! The only fps drops I have	 are when it loads a city into view or something big like that. Other than that	 runs like champion!!"

Played for about 9 hours today which is day 2 of release with some friends I used to squad with on DayZ SA	 and we all had the best time. Obviously some bugs to work out and some other things that need some fixing but other than that a very solid release	 Gunplay is good	 not the best but tolerable	 could be smoothed out. Took me a minute to get used to using scroll wheel to change running speed but fairly ok considering tarkov kind of does the same thing just not as ingrained in the gameplay. Graphically pretty good reminds me of Miscreated	 and having the attributes and stuff to customize your character to help with vision and awareness is pretty cool too. The puppets are awesome	 decent AI so far haven't had any major issues	 the Mechs however need some major work	 really cool feature but the targeting can get pretty wonky pretty quick while trying to sneak by them. Can't wait to see how the game grows and changes everything so far is very promising. A lot of people have been getting frame drops	 my friends included	 personally I haven't had an issue with my i5-8600k and 1080ti (Get about 135 - 160fps constant on Epic	 with only one crash out of 12 hours of gameplay)	 but have heard about constant crashes on the reg. 1080 as well as anything lower than a 1070 getting major fps drops in certain areas	 which is to be expected the game just released	 an optimization patch is more than likely coming very soon. Will update this review when I get further along than 12 hours but as of now I highly recomend especially for any hardcore survival players looking for  a new game to sink your teeth into."

I love the game	 people are really talking down about the game because there is some issues that have to be fixed. Give the game a chance however because It just launched. Cons:Some stuttering when the weather changes.:Some fps drop in some dense forests.:The map is huge and hard to navagate at times.:The mechs at military bases can sometimes see you through walls.Pros:The game is extremely fun with friends.:The crafting aspect of the game is good at it's current state.:Giant mech robot guards!:Hunting is amazing with the system they put in place.:The whole Matabolizm system they put in makes the game go in more depth than I've seen in a video game.:It's cheap	 just 20 bucks.:If you're bored of running around there is a deathmatch mode you can play to earn fame points. (In game points that help you spawn to things when you die.):There is a lot of room for development.Overall: 7/10 (at it's current state) The game is very in depth as it is	 and if developers listen to the reviews of the game there will most likely be quick improvements to come. If you are playing alone	 i'd hold off or try to find someone in game to play with. If you have friends	 get the game. Try it out for yourself	 and be immersed in a beautiful world surrounded by danger and wildlife. And try and survive."

I run it on high/med and get 70-80 fps in densely wooded areas with a GTX 1070 and an i5 8600k	 nice! On top of that	 there is a decent amount of things to do in the game for now and I am sure the devs will be on their toes to keep this game fresh for us gamers - they have impressed me with their PR so far so I am sure they won't let us down.If that hasn't slightly inched you towards the buy button	 it is only $20 for a game with great potential and so far	 so good dev team to keep it going. Just give it a shot and you might be surprised...or wait until they optimize their servers."

Not many I don't write many complex reviews but scum really deserves it. In my opinion scum is worth the $22 Canadian and it's even worth picking up the support pack to help the devs. The game and its current state is both playable and enjoyable. I've read a lot of the negative reviews and some of them are just silly. And personally I think for Early Access games that shouldn't be a positive or negative review there should be a recommendation or an opinionated section because you can't judge a game that's not even fully released	 but back to the negative reviews people said that the mechs were to overpowered but they're on a simple script where they do the same movements and they're pretty easy 2 time. As far as the metabolism goes and the nutrition stats if you have a general knowledge of the nutrients and requirements of the human body it's not a complex system to understand. Not only do I have recommend this game highly	 I recommend this company and any of their products ever!"

Killed them 5x until they spawned and punch me to death and took my loot. Sad to see cheaters already in this game. Cool concept and hopefully they will patch these issues or it will be another PUBG cheating spree game.

But we have to expect a lot more coming in the next patch since the game is still in early acces by that said	 yes there are a lot if bugs	 the melee systeme is very messy	 but we can already see that the DEV are already working hard on all of this on Day1 meeting other people in the game was horrible they were teleporting everywhere but already this problem look to be solved as I play today and never had a probleme to deal with anybody.so if you like this genre the you should definetivly give it a try and for 20$ in day1 for me is way better than a DayZ that been so long in early acces and offer such a bad optimized game for 40ish $ (sorry for mistake im not english)"

The main thing that need work are the fps and crafting in a little weird	 and the big robots that patrol high loot areas	 they auto lock on you through walls and can see you from a mile away. They also have to add some way to protect your loot from other players because right now you can only really hide it in the woods in a box	 but I heard that they will be adding base building later down the line. But this game is really amazing and it is worth the 20 bucks. Really good hardcore survival game with ok pvp."

Looting	 looting	 looting garbage items. Hiding from a Mech for 10 minutes trying to loot a small area.... Finally see a person!!! Give him some beans and a axe	 he invites me to a party.. 10 seconds later his guy disappears (prob a dc)... Back to running	 then looting	 looting looting. Ending up with a handgun	 granny pack	 hippy pants	 canned peaches and a bunch of other fun stuff like paper and a notebook to store my thoughts like (why did I just pay $20 for this).. Exited game..

I can understand in real life when you aim down the sights of a weapon	 you can't see around it. But you can't even look over your shoulder in this game without it being blurred out. And not to mention when you do this	 you can't see players behind you. They appear completely invisible. If someone is just barely around a corner enough	 they become invisble. 2.) Sickness. Yeah	 I expect to get sick when I wipe my♥♥♥♥♥with my hand and then eat my can of peaches. BUT that doesn't mean give me herpo-ghonnoreha mega AIDS that I can't cure	 and throw up every three steps of the way on my 20 KM journey. 3.) Map size. To be 64 players	 the map is WAY too big. All the points of interests are spread too far with way too much vegetation and fillers in the way of them. Either shrink the map	 or push everything closer together. I can understand wanting to be like DayZ with this	 but I've spent about 10 minutes out of my 16 hours in combat	 only to get one shot by someone through desync. WITH a ballistic vest. 4.) Spawns. I can understand the devs putting in a system to prevent people from just killing themselves to spawn close to military loot. But when it costs 25 points to respawn	 even if you're not killing yourself	 you're being penalized to be killed on your spawn by people with military loot	 or some pistol banger. Either that	 or you spawn in the middle of BFE with no buildings around what-so-ever. 5.) If you're gonna have a game where you can get military grade weapons incredibly easily	 don't make it so you die in one shot to the leg. Or one shot to the chest when you're wearing a ballistic vest. At least implement different grades of armor to help this	 or tone down the weapon damage or increase the health cap to some extent. I've had 5 minute shotgun fights with people because of desync	 and tanked WAY more shots than I could with a vest. 6.) Desync. I COMPLETELY understand that this game is in Early access. But right now	 combat is pretty much doodoo. If you wanna camp	 go ahead. Those poor new spawns you're shooting at can't escape	 cause their hitboxes are the size of a truck because of the desync when they move out of the way of your shots. I wanna love this game. But having to run super far on a limited stamina system is a complete and utter pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The bluriness mixed with the desync of combat makes it a hard love-hate relationship. I'm routing for this game in the future	 but for now I've gotta downvote."

It's rather slow to get into the game	 if you spend like 5 hours and died like 10 times you will probably learn some things	 well except People who played this kind of games before	 they surely know how to play.All in all it's not bad but not good either	 I expected a more stalker like Game with anomlies	 mutants	 artefacts aaaaaaand of course the good old cheeki breeki iv Damke Bandits + Duty and Freedom.. a three way faction is always the best choice for any game.I still hope that someone will Create a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl	 Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat in a way we could actually join factions and wage faction Wars/raids on each other camps (which should be NPC lead) Well pros for SCUM is that it has ""features"" Also the reloading mechnics are realistic	 the finding of such items is more or less irrelevant when you can easily craft pretty much all ammo types from scrap metal rather then looting military bases or police Camps. The cons are well... the combat system you try to land a hit with your spear the ""puppet"" gets knocked away but imidiatly recovers	 even when you knock the ""puppet"" down to the ground it will do a kungfu jump upwards... The spawning is a mess	 you can be spawned anywhere even if you have enough fame to respawn in the same quadrant you will get spawned at the edges (for me at least) combat agains animals is also clunky	 you hit them they either charge away or they try to circle you and get stuck in the corners... first boar and bear kill in a corner	 helpless animal didn't know what to do.The character Creation is not finished	 yet? Idk what gives	 there are features that are visible but can't be altered	 wtf?!also all the info on the player is somewhat disturbing the gameplay.In the End this game will most likely	 never be in full release State	 because of the sales."

It's in early access. Not just in early access	 but immediately starting the early access stage	 not several months or years in where the devs would have had the opportunity to work with players on what they want and needs attention. Honestly	 half these negative reviews are worthless and just straight up petty because they don't seem to want to acknowledge that. Going into this game expecting it to be free of issues will result in you having a bad time. As of now	 the game is pretty much just an exploration/crafting/surviving game with not much else. Could this game have started off with a couple more things to do than just explore	 craft	 and kill? Sure. But despite all that this game is fun. It's fun because it's got so much potential that the devs have stated they plan to implement so there is a lot to look forward to. It's fun because survival games that you can play with your friends are fun. It's fun because you can tell that it is a well thought-out game that is survival yet not centered in the battle royale theme	 or clogged with trolls and abandoned bases on all the servers that make multi-player and co-op games unplayable."

I'm liking it overall while playing with a small group of new friends.  Loving the atmosphere	 unique charactors	 and teamwork.  Food system is a little to intense	 several game days after finding vitamin D I'	 still sick/deficient from it.  Overall a very solid start for an interesting concept	 some minor tweaks and additions should make this a real winner."

For $20 and a promise to add more to the game and keep working on it	 i'd say its definately worth if you like survival type dayz games. We'll see in the future how well it turns out. Huge potential and very fun with great RP elements. People who vote negative havent played hardcore survival games or hate early access games."

The devs released a garbage game mechanic in their spawning system that makes solo play absolutely irrelevant and a waste of time. You can kill 2 players within 30 seconds of eachother and the first could spawn on their teammate in the same exact town as you within seconds. There is no balance between a solo player and a 2 man+ group. You could spend 8 hours owning everyone and a 2 man could respawn on eachother over and over again until they kill you by spending easily earned fame that they gained from killing zombies and baiting mechs. Until the game developers remove this trash mechanic of spawning on teammates without any sort of timer or combat detector the game is worthless to anybody who plans on playing solo."

I have seen way to many negative reviews on this game from people complaining about bugs. Yes it has bugs are any game breaking at moment no. Another cause of negative reviews I see the mechs are to hard. You have got to be kidding me. Anyone who gives this game a negative review because the mechs are ""broken"" or ""too hard"" is just pathetic. The robots protect the best spots for loot makes sense. They have set paths they move on and unless you already upset the robot he does not engage immediately. With a game like this that put a lot of attention in metabolism and such I would like to think I can find a challenge in it. I was concerned that the Devs were going to listen to the cry babies of the community when I saw the mechs get nerfed a little	 but in another update their accuracy was increased so that was good. Personally I think the Mechs could be made a lot harder while still having some kicking room. At the moment getting guns and military gear is end game and it is really easy to get geared. Especially if you have some fame points to back up you suicide runs. I truly don't understand how you have a hard time with the Mechs in their current state	 but all I can advice is recognize it is an Early Access game and that it is not meant to be easy. 10/10 game in my heart want to see another survival game develope others I have played have gone stale for me."

The game is already very detailed in tracking stats etc but also currently bloated with placeholders that doesnt have any meaning yet. That being said	 without watching some gameplay or guide videos the game is allready pretty difficult which is fun but i cant imagine how it will be when the game nears launch and you cant just ""eat all the shrooms"" you come across or never pay a mind to that severe Calcium deficiency you have been having.I really do enjoy the attention to detail which makes even this unpolished game a gem. carb and sugar loaded foods and drinks zip through you but if you have a meal consisting solely of 1Kg of bear steak its gonna sit in you for a while and you wont be able to eat or drink much for a while afterwards. also your calories will be drawn from it slower.Small things I dont pay mind to in other games: jump over the small river dont just walk through it! why? because your clothes get wet	 then they get heavy and then you are slower and spend more energy moving and get colder easier etc etc etc and that because i didnt think before crossing the stream.ALSO REMEMBER:It is a survival game first and that is what you should expect. You climb the fame ladder faster while crafting and surviving than looting and shooting. manage your expectations.There are PVP events which are a great idea	 it manages to quench the bloodthirst that builds up after a while of smashing rocks together. That makes it sound dull but the crafting is very satisfying.Some servers has some issues sometimes	 obviously the game is still being developed and early access only just started	 dont get angry about growing pains if you decided to join before the completed product. But honestly its not that bad and I still enjoy myself tonnes in game so nothing is so bad it ruins the game currently. The worst that has happened is like twice i decided to leave a server and go to aother one because the previous server seemed a bit laggy on a particular day.SO BASICALLY:If you are into survival games or other genral challenging games	 this game	 even in its current state is still a steal for its price	 DEFINATELY worth it!"

After now playing 18 (40 and still going strong) hours since it became available I have to say I have been BLOWN AWAY! Colour me impressed! It is rare for a game to be this kind of solid these days on early access launch. The ""Bad""There have been a few quirks and desyncs but nothing I would call game breaking or major.Awareness seems to be a little too strong when it comes to finding other players shelter and storage.It seems you need to eat a little too often and mineral/nutrient absorbsion rates are high as well.Through experience I'll venture to say  helmets don't seem to offer any protection. I snuck up on some poor sap in my bright orange jumper and threw a spear through his skull while he was wearing a high tier helmet	 was fun to loot him though	 he was stacked!I can't seem to figure out how to repair clothing	 assuming its been implemented and I haven't stashed a sowing kit away for bumpkis.(*)Post nerf Mr Smiley is now Mr Limpy. I had looting bunkers down to a science pre patch	 now its kind of embarassing. Some bunkers due to patrol pattern aren't worth the risk but many of them are cake walks	 IMO.(*)I'll agree with the nerf partially but it was excessive	 he needs a slight sound radius buff	 counter plays added and a little TLC on his AI to clean him up. Doing those things would allow him to have pre patch damage	 the cone increase idea I liked but it seems you made it too wide	 shrink it some.(*)It would be nice to have scope proficiency as well to keep people from looting high tier loot and just running wild with a SVD a click off. Looting high end items is just too easy.EDIT: Thank you Devs	 it seems you listened on a lot of the other points I had listed.The GoodThe vapor trail for gauging shots down range is a smart ideaWet mechanic	 love it. Its restricts the ability to abuse bodies of water but its REAL.(*)Bullet crafting	 its simple and straight forward. Well played! (Perhaps make ammo dies as part of the recipe you need to craft them as well to add another layer to keep people from amassing tons of ammo right off the bat)(*)After playing with the crafting further I've determined	 though you can't place things traditionally that items crafted (structure/boxes) fall at you're 2 o'clock	 roughly. Item trajectory can be blocked by trees	 boulders etc.Enviroment is key to immersion and its been blended well. Foilage is excellent and ""debris"" in the undergrowth is well done (Too many ferns though	 add a little variation)Mr Smiley is awesome and has plenty of ways to study and counter. He just needs a slight tweaking. (Will stand by this statement post patch	 see above)Loot loot loot loot loot	 theres lots of it and many ways to utilize it. Overall excellent job. Would loot metal again(*)My last point	 I'm unsure what to think of it because its fun but also ridiculous. Thrown items seem to have the velocity of Zeus throwing a thunderbolt. I was looting a bunker with my bud and found a bottle of wine. So naturally I down it hoping to get an alcohol affect or at least to get the nutrients I then huck the bottle across the room and it sounds like a grenade when it strikes a metal desk. We both had a great laugh as we went and inspected further	 noticing it was lodged neck deep in the desk!All in all 9/10Do yourself a favor and hop on this early. I expect great things	 don't be like WildCard and PlayerUnknown. EDIT:(*)Memory leak seems to have been fixed.Keep up the good work SCUM devs!"

Hunting is a durned God send!! One animal or hooman/muppet will last you a good long while on protein; ""Balance your diet	 dearies""	 says grandma. ""Eat them veggies"" said parents. Always have some clean rags on you for bandages. First thing you wanna do is build a backpack. I could keep going	 but ANYWAYS	 everything about the game is great so far. It performs VERY well for me	 hardly any lag that I've noticed. There are crashes	 but it's EA	 and you get right back in. This game has POTENTIAL; a lot of it!!! I am very excited to see the base/fortification system come into play. Maybe loot some other peoples fortified houses or something	 idk. I'll wrap it up with this. It's only 20 bucks (a total steal)	 it's well optimized	 compared to other EA titles on their second day	 if you have a decent rig	 it's fun	 addictive	 and'll get your heart going in some pvp! All my friends have the game	 and are very much enjoying it	 as well. Play it with friends	 it's a blast! If they do what I think they'll do with this game	 it will be the next big thing	 in terms of survival games. I strongly believe they will.

513710	0	0	Vadnais	158	8	1	38.5	August 30	 201	Highly recommend this game if you like good fun passed survival games. This game has alot of cool features such as the human body realism never seen in a game before from me which can be difficult but very interesting. This game has no building except a shelter and a storage box which is nice but maybe base building in future could be also cool. I love how there is a singleplayer feature never seen this in games like this before. NOTE dont get attached to gear because a Mech will awp your S h i t. Is it fun and worth yes is it hard yes is it worth it yes. What i dont see that should be added vehicles but it could possibly ruin the body system because people will get lazy and stop walking and running places so now everyone would probably be fat. Base building would be interesting too! is this more pvp or survival id say more pvp but is survival game. Cool guns and sheeet so i suggest buying this game looks fun but alot of lag spikes that ive noticed which can be a  A S S  breaker when being chased by Mechs or zombies. RECOMMEND BUT NOTE DYING IS GONNA HAPPEN SO DONT GET A S S HURT ABOUT YOUR GEAR BUT buy it if your down for some cool experiences. I honestly think that this game put Day Z the game thats a food simulator game pretty much to shame.

In Scum YOUR health and well being comes before anything. The game takes an extremely realistic approach on whats happening inside your characters body. You can starve	 die of thirst	 become under/overweight	 break limbs	 get sick	 vomit	 urinate	 sh*t. etc. So you must make sure your body is strong and ready for anything because if not you'll probably get viciously murdered and chopped up into yummy chunks.

However as you learn the game in single player mode there's one really big frustrating aspect.You can't save game	 and the only way to store things is to make a box by your shelter.What this means is that you could literally spend hours getting your full military rig and weapons	 and then you try to sneak into a new location and BANG.I've been shot from an unspotted Mech with bodyarmour and a helmet and dead in one shot.Hours of play down the toilet.This wouldn't be too bad if you could go back and collect your stuff from the ground.

I really enjoy playing it! I have a really bad pc (gtx550ti and stuff) and still have only minor problems with fps	 the game still looks beauty and I can hunt wildlife and zombies	 no problem! But other players are rubberbanding from time to time	 that means shooting at them is only a good Idea if they stand still or you have a smg or shotgun	 so I mostly try to trade and talk to people instead of hunting them. As far as I heard	 this is due to be fixed!And that's where my biggest point comes in! At the moment the community is ♥♥♥♥ed	 nearly everybody shoots on sight and ignores any pleas or conversations	 even if you are a freshspawn you get killed regularly even if you have nothing on you person! But that's not the fault of the game	 it's the fault of the players! So to come to a point: Performance and Community sucks	 but this is something that will change! The game is still in Alpha and it only costs 16€	 I had a lot of fun with friends	 the stealth-parts are just awesome and there where some situations where we had a really good time fighting enemys and talking with strangers at gunpoint. If you have some money in your poket and want a better DayZ	 buy this! But if you just want to kill people	 please buy something else! The conversations and interactions	 even though limited	 are perfectly implemented and they are getting obsolete by just shooting on sight! Please consider this befor you buy it! :)"

Looting for loot is a fun and exciting feeling	 the ai in the game are verry buggy at the moment tho	 often staring at you through walls	 making it almost impossible to get around them	 the ingame map is verry nice	 knowing where you are at all times is a good feature. the ""squad"" system is aslo very nice. the only problems with the game right now are things such as fighting hand to hand	 it is verry buggy right now	 often ending in just 2 people running circles around eachother. the guns and gun play mechanics are bad but the potential is there	 it is all server issues right now	 most people often just look as though they are telaporting or just lagging really bad	 it makes it almost impossibe to kill or even hit them. overall the game has alot of potential and i really see it going somewhere	 this is coming from a guy who has 1400 hours in rust. once the servers and robots get fixed	 the game would have almost nothing wrong in my eyes"

A lot of the health aspects seem a bit superficial right now	 but it allows for some interesting and difficult mechanics to be implimented if they decide to do so in the future. The progression and materials of crafting is spot-on	 perfect.The storage system is still very alpha. As is	 you only know that you lack something you need to craft an item. It needs to show you an exact count of what you're missing/what you have. Instead it shows you a highlight of the items you have	 one by one	 so you have to sit there and count everything to figure out whats missing. The storage system should also be its own context window with slots.Took a while	 but I encountered my first ""kill all"" chinese hacker in the game after about 16 hours. Hacking hasn't been an issue before so I would hope this is something that can be patched easily. There's nothing more infurating than a player with no skill or interest in the game instantly killing you no matter where you are on the map. Considering the nature of this game as a survival title	 countering hacks it should be one of the top priorities. A player base that can't progress will stop playing altogether."

Any hopes you might have for a ""what DayZ was supposed to be	"" standard won't hold up here. SCUM admittedly has started in a decent direction	 but the game features more as a tech-demo than an actual game at this point in time. I've played enough of the game to understand what content it has to offer	 but all that it can offer at the moment is derivative of the games that came before.SCUM currently features a character customisation unlike any seen in most open world	 post-apocalyptic survival games. In concept this would be a widely refreshing thing	 if it weren't for the fact that this feature is just that	 a concept. Like most of the game	 it currently shows proudly and somewhat blatantly all the features you can't use at this moment in time	 sometimes to its detriment. I am by no means saying the game is going to be	 or currently is bad	 but for the asking price of £15.49 from the studios that brought you titles such as Serious Sam and Gas Guzzlers	 these developers certainly are asking you to back a lot on faith for a game unlike anything they've developed before.Chances are	 if you like the genre this game has to offer and have bought games in the past like; DayZ	 Rust	 H1Z1	 Miscreated	 etc. You like myself may enjoy this title periodically	 but beware that this is yet another game promising much	 but threatening to deliver little. With Steam's refund policy being so strict	 I for one am not prepared to gamble yet more money on a game that is so early in its development cycle	 from developers with less experience than companies that came before in this corner of the market.That being said	 I truly hope I'm proven wrong."

THIS IS NOT DAYZ   It may look similar and it might have a few of the same items	 but that doesn't make it the failure that was DayZ stand alone.  The Metabolism tab may look intimidating but as long as you take a moment to understand what you need to keep an eye on and the stuff that you don't really need to pay that much attention to	 then you'll find it is actually quite helpful.  DayZ had horrible lag	 garbage zombies	 and a dev. team that frankly didn't care.  With almost 17 hours in I can assure you it rarely lags	 the  Zombies   Puppets  are decent for this game just being released	 and the pvp is fairly accurate.  Some people have been complaining that there isn't enough loot and that it shouldn't be so hard to find guns.  Honestly	 what do you guys expect from a  SURVIVAL GAME .  The gaming community should keep an open mind since this game just came out and should stop comparing it to all the other games on the market.  Through our support I'm sure this game could reach its full potential and become one of the best Open World Survival games on the market.  10/10"

It is a better version of PUBG and dayz combined. The only thing keeping it from being a huge hit are a few bugs/improvements that need to be made.FIRST	 the main problem is frames. The game auto set me on all epic settings	 and with that you are guarenteed around 5-10 fps. I turned every setting down to the lowest possible	 and the frames increase to 40-50 (if your lucky maybe 60 frames every couple minutes)	 with MAJOR lag spikes every 30 seconds. By major I mean the game freezing up completely for a 4 second period.My other problem comes with the health. When you hit a zombie	 they can take upwards of thirty shots to kill	 and I feel like this needs to be fixed.Don't get me wrong	 I absolutely think this game can suceed on the market	 the idea is very original	 but I sadly must give this a negative review because of the very low frames and some major bugs that make the game nearly unplayable. Once these are fixed	 I will gladly give this a positive review."

Although there were many server issues at the start	 they fixed them almost immedietly. Ontop of that	 I would like to add a couple potential future outlooks that they can maybe add	 or fix. For instance	 they should go in detail about what each attribute does	 an how it will affect you in the game	 such as intelligence level helping you open cans of food	 an not survival	 and many of the other attributes which will affect your end game result of your character	 an his limitations of what he can not only craft	 but also do in the game. Overall I've been waiting for this game for a while	 an it's so far so good	 just a few suggestions for the dev's. Fun game	 can't wait for the full release	 dont rush it!"

UI/UX - Different but better then most. To the eye it's fairly clean "" a little busy"" but the aproach on interactions is new.GRAPHICS - Dig it	 I get the feel of final looks easy. Plus I havn't seen this many graphic options in an Alpha or Beta. Content - The quest for loot is great	 Heavy player interactions in certain areas. Though this is where she really lifts her dress to show the alpha state. Not much to do if you dont like PvP for the sake of PvP. Once geared there's no reason to be in the world anymore. No reason to explore ""quests"" or join matches that cost you something but dont give a reward. I heard the end game is to take the chip off and escape....DEVS- Do not make your end game goal to leave the game... thats just bad direction. Create reasons to stay in your game not leave it. Your player base will drop. Invest in reasons to thrive in game world. VOTE - Best Alpha base iv'e played in awhile. Worth the experince	 but come back later once they implement a reason to play."

Most servers that are near capacity have had desync issues that make PVP unenjoyable for a lot of people	 but the devs have been very open about these issues--and the need to fix them.Overall	 I'd say the game is definitely worth $20 in its current state if the premise interests you at all OR if you have friends to play with."

It's early access	 and the reason we get to play it is because the developers want feedback	 and we're paying to play something that isn't entirely done	 but it's playable enough. This game for being early access and that it's  the first version released to the public	 has some great handling features. The game doesn't feel clumsy with the movement system and handles pretty well overall. The graphics are pretty spot on. The only problem with the graphics is that weird distance blur.The map is designed pretty well with plenty to loot from. The main thing is that there is a HUGE loot difference between towns and military installations. The towns have hardly nothing in them	 and you eventually have to loot like half the town to find decent stuff	 then there is the military bunkers that will give you plenty of what you need. Although after you loot bunkers and get fully geared	 there isn't much to do. You could go try and mow down players	 but honestly that is cheap	 and honestly isn't fun to me.I've had a decent time on this game with almost 24 hours within the 3 days it launched. Getting to know the game and how it works and everything. I looted buildings	 scavenged areas and learned to craft with a friend. We both went into this heads first and it was a great experience. We eventually learned the basics and started looting military compounds for our loot	 which isn't that hard if you know what you're doing. But now we can get fully geared. We came across a few players and made some nice casual conversations and actually became good friends with a random we came across in a town. We now play with him every once in a while.Now enough with the long ramblings and i'm gonna get to the pros and cons.PROS-Great inventory system-Movement system is great (Stamina makes so much sense	 and how you build your character effects it more. Elevated terrain	 having different clothes on	 how much gear	 and if you are wet effects how well you can move.)-A big map with plenty to explore	 and parts of the map give different feels.( There is room for improvement to expand the map for more to do along the way to different places. Adding abandoned camp sites or objects in the wild would help.)-The Metabolism is complex	 but it works and how it effets you is so detailed.(There are different phases of wounds	 starvation	 dehydration and etc.-The process of doing actions and looting is smooth.CONS-There are some rendering bugs that can effect players. I have my settings on high	 so I never see the bugs. (My friends played on low res for the benefit of spotting players. Some solid walls and buildings don't rendor in but mechs	 zombies and players do from what I hear. They've never spotted anyone from this and it doesn't happen that often.-The map does feel filling and empty at the same time. (There is a lot of diffrent unique areas to explore	 but after you lootup and have all the gear you need it feels pointless to go into bases or towns	 having you in this sort of state of completion	 but yet nothing to do.)I'm sure the game will grow with time	 and I've read that they plan on having different things be implemented into the game later on that will help it grow. Base building will be introduced where you can take over houses in towns and make them your home	 and vehicles will be introduced eventually as well. I hope they add more randomness and more Interactions to help with the emptiness. Maybe zombie hoards or a way to help flesh out looting. Because the gap between looting military places and towns is such a high jump. After you get fully geared	 there should be more to do.My overall statement will be if you have problems with this game	 please wait and give it time. It needs time to grow and develop. What they have now is great for starters	 and they'll improve the game over time. Whether that is gameplay wise or to help with perfromance	 bugs and cheaters	 it'll come. I say at this point we get to see the game with it's core features and gameplay	 and it will evolve and grow with time. If you really want to wait for a fully done game you can wait for it to grow. Although there is a good bit of content and time you can put into this now. It's your choice. If you buy it	 at least get a friend or find someonce to play it with	 its x1000 times better."

Basic movement and inventory and the survival metrics are introduced	 and that's pretty much it. Graphics are slightly above average but still nothing very impressive	 and the structural prop asset work certainly leaves things to be desired; while done fairly well prop reuse is heavy	 and every building feels almost the same. Loot table and variety seems almost inadequate	 if only because of the intense complexity of the nutrition system.But that's about it	 they have a loooooong way to go before the game is enjoyable.If your only goal in life is to smash a few zombies with a nail stick and tinker with your protein vs fat consumption ratios	 than SCUM is for you. Otherwise I recommend steering clear until at least 2019."

But this is a review of the game in ITS CURRENT STATE and will answer the question of if you should buy it now or not.Right now	 its a walking sim much like DayZ	 if you played and liked that	 then you may like this.There is currently very little to craft	 almost nothing to build except a small shelter	 which...you dont need seeing as its perpetually day time and you could just use one of the many	 many	 many	 many....MANY empty houses to store stuff.Yes yes	 IF the devs do everything they are promising then it will be fantastic but this is a review of it NOW for its current price.The short of it is this. Right now	 there is absolutely nothing to do except run around a truly massive world and find some gear. Kill a few animals	 bash in the heads of a few zombies	 or kill some players if you're so inclined. There is no character progression save for the 'Fame Point' system which currently is just like your level but has no use. No skill	 nothing to level up or use your 'xp' on. Yes	 this all may come in the future and I hope it does	 but it sure aint there now.I'm going to keep it in hopes that it turns into everything I'd hoped for. But I'd wait if you haven’t been sold by what you just read.I'm giving it a thumbs down for now because I don’t believe its worth the price tag. I will be happy to revisit this review once they have added more content.P.S. Oh	 and if you are playing single player...every time you log out atm	 you lose ALL of your Fame Points (your level)...yeeeeeah. Better fix that quick smart Devs."

One of the only games so far I actually care to play on multiplayer with so far. I haven't played for to long so haven't been able to do everything yet	 but will update my review later on when I have more game time into it. I also always recommend buying the game and trying it if you don't like it then just ask for a refund. I also won't give all the positives and negatives as that would be a lot of typing. Pros: -Single player and multiplayer. I rarely have good internet or any at all so when I don't it's nice to play single player and practice playing. (so thank you game devs)-As close as you can probably get to real survival for a game on nutritional level-Good graphics-Enjoy how clothes can be effected by little things like rain and snow-Fighting bare handed or with a weapon against puppets isn't to easy yet not to difficult -Devs actually seem to really care about and support this game-The Mechs or bots give it a nice change other than just a ripoff of dayz-Big size mapCons:-It does have a few optimization problems	 but it is the first day in early access.-The Mechs might need to be nerfed a little (personal opinion)-Food is almost impossible to find (Supposebly you can eat other puppets haven't tried it yet though)-Hunger is way to constant it seems -Fighting isn't terrible just could use a little more work-Servers supposebly crash quite a bit ( I haven't had any problems though so far).-Needs more than just 64 people a server since the map is pretty big-Crafting needs to be reworked severly in my opinion-Base building could be implemented-Needs to have something to work towards to more instead of just survive.-More wildlife would be nice to have-Maybe a tutorial on how the game works and basic mechanics of the game would be helpful also( I guess thats kinda what single player is for).Overall it's a great suvival game especially for being the first day in early access. Only being $20USD you get a great game with a lot fo potential I'm hoping for single player the devs add maybe some things for a storyline or even a way to get out if you become famous enough. Will it more likely happen probably not since it's main focus is multiplayer	 but it would be nice for us who don't have the ability to play online with friends all the time. Keep up the good work devs!!"

If it lives up to its promises it will wipe the floor with most of the other titles in the survival genres.Having said that here is why I wont recommend this titleIn the promotional material it is implied that there is already a huge amount of content in the game including massive character customizations. This is entirely false. There are only 4 character customizations available and females have yet to be added. The starting player stats are also extremely limited.The game itself it pretty much empty at the moment. Combat is clunky and frustrating and when you die... well basically don't get attached to all those things you spent hours collecting because unless you know the map inside and out	 you are lucky to relocate your corpse to claim your stuffBasically if you want to play a carbon copy of every other zombie survival game and convince youself that its different because of the title screen this is the title for you."

This game hates anything that isn't minimized	 it's the first game I've seen where my frames drop from 60 to 30 as soon as I unminimize google chrome or any media player.Once you get this game running well	 it's a blast.However probably my biggest gripe with the game is that there is still no way of tying people up and knocking them out. I think those are going to get added soon though."

Most houses are copy paste of each other	 and loot is reaaaaly thin on the ground.Not starving to death takes a lot of busy work in single player.In multiplayer	 it would be impossible with other players looting buildings before you.Loot that rare is going to resurrect the problem that DayZ has	 and that's the issue of people shooting you for a can of beans. If loot were more plentiful	 then people would let you live	 and more emergent play would emerge.I actually found the movement to be pretty fluid	 not sure what the complaint there is.Huge amount of variety in the loot	 but that's another issue. With no base-building in game	 you cannot store loot. This means that the more complex crafting items will never be created as the items just take up far too much room in your inventory.""Will i take the cabbage and not starve to death	 or will i keep the pan that i might need for a recipe i could create in another 4 hours time?"" Everyone is taking the cabbage....Reloading weapons is a chore. Unpack the ammo box. Load that into a clip (Separate loot item to the gun. **** you if you find a gun but never a clip to put in it)	 put the clip into the gun	 chamber the first round. It's far too much busy work.Overall	 i would wait for a few months while they hopefully sort some of this stuff out. Great potential	 but not worth the money right now."

Game should have difficulty level for those that have trouble with this kind of game. game is not optimized either and should have a tutorial to help you understand the game. AS of now I think the game is a great concept but poor delivery. I will try again in 6 months if the game is still here but it is not balanced for newbs like me.

513710	1	0	weenus	236	5	1	44.5	August 30	 201	"The general point that it's ""DayZ but fun"" is pretty accurate. Then you add in a body sim that every game I've ever played in the survival genre can't hold a candle to. It's pretty deep and a bit confusing or daunting at first but I found it interesting to learn about as I was playing through the game and the body sim was more engaging than what I had experienced so far.I've seen lots of complaints about loot in the reviews but I was playing on a full official server for others last night and had no problem with loot. Found multiple rifles	 shotguns	 an MP5	 pistols... and I found a good portion of those items in towns	 not just military loot. It did take me a good while to find a mag for the MP5 though.Overall I'm really enjoying it	 I'll admit though	 I've gutted it out through a lot of Early Access games so the general stuff like servers restarting	 memory leaks and some desync are things I've fairly used to at this point. If nothing gets addressed or improved on those fronts in coming weeks I could change my review but if you don't expect that stuff throughout the first few weeks of an Early Access game by 2018 you haven't been doing your homework.So far so good	 can't wait to see what they have in store in the coming months and long term."

You know the type - Game seems new and interesting	 promises are made	 community forum warriors get loud about X Y or Z	 dev thinks these few loud represent the entire base	 dev backpedals on promises or shifts gears to please said warriors	 warriors still unhappy because nothing pleases these types anyway	 warriors bomb forums with ""lol game already dead"" posts	 actual playerbase sees this and gets turned off and stops playing	 and there you have it - early access failure cascade in a nutshell. I REALLY hope that doesnt happen to this game	 but if history is any measure	 well....sigh.I hope the dev just sticks to their vision for the game	 and delivers on THAT vision	 BEFORE giving weight to the forum warriors minority opinions. Early access means you get to receive feedback you wouldnt otherwise have.

If you are hidden you won't show up for others unless they ""see you"" through camoflauge and stealth. Basically	 doesn't matter if you have no foliage in your settings or bald hills from a mile away. Won't help.2. Character metabolism system and other mechanics feel good and fresh. People still enjoy pvping in some areas above everything else but these are good features.3. World is rich with places to explore. I'd say loot could be a little more common overall and it is tricky to get guns. Usually you get a gun with no magazine	 or you get magazine with no gun	 or ammo with none of the above or.. Yeah you got it right.Unless you really hit the jackpot	 it's wise to stick with shotguns and KAR/Hunting rifle that don't use mags or clips.4. Mecha are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with some really weird vision angles. They need some testing and explanation the way they spot you is somewhat weird.5.

Walk into the odd player who will kill you on site no questions asked due to the lack off loot in this game. The map is huge which sometimes can be a bonus but with no vehicles to speak of you will be running your charcter to death while trying to find a tin of beans in the nearest town. All game modes outside of the survival aspect require respect points which you earn in survival mode so if you don't have the patience for that well good luck to you because from first spawn in you don't have enough and you go into negative points if you keep dying. The lag and the woeful PVP just compound the problem and it's more of a chore to play this game than it is fun. After 50mins of running	 finding very little of anything and then being killed off by players for my only tin of beans I requested a refund of this game.

The hardcore survival aspects are actually surprisingly fun	 I never thought I'd have fun foraging for mushrooms to at least meet 40% of my caloric goal of that day. Right now this game only really has basic versions of mechanics they plan on implementing	 currently my favorite feature is the melee combat. It's really basic right now but still	 boxing zombies and other players and throwing in kicks	 or blocking followed by a jab really feels great. They'll be adding more martial art styles and continue to advance the melee combat in the game	 think active dodging	 rear naked chokes; if your player knows jiu jitsu he can counter it	 there's no mention of this but I imagine that's where melee combat is going. Ranged combat feels great too	 bullets feel fatal like bullets	 with the exception of the shotgun (it feels undertuned right now	 does'nt have the same realism feel when you shoot someone in  the chest and they're mostly ok). A stray bullet to the chest or head will most likely kill you	 it also penetrates surfaces like sheet metal	 wood	 (sometimes the ground	 you can see light passing through the hole lol). So long as you can afford 10 fame points	 you can join events which are basically like your run of the mill team deathmatch with set equipment you can choose from	 you don't keep it in the end	 good way to practice your aim/tactics. Looting feels how it should in real life	 if you loot a kitchen	 expect to find kitchen knives and canned food	 looting an armory; expect to find guns and ammo	 my biggest qualm right now is the loot reset timer seems off	 feels like there's just no loot sometimes to find. Might take me like 5 hours of playing on an active server 35+ players to actually find enough ammo for a gun to fully load a magazine/clip	 I guess that's realism for you. The game is also gorgeous	 though they're working on optimization	 lower end pc's will really struggle and stutter in cities and towns	 high end pc's have no issues. Currently there's an issue where the longer you play	 the laggier it gets	 your frames will start dropping	 as well as when there are a lot of players on that server	 say 50 or more out of 64 players. There's a third person camera	 however you'll only see a projection of what your character can see through their eyes	 you can't hide behind a wall and peek around with the 3rd person camera and expect to see someone	 I think this is great as 3rd person always gives campers and people in high ground a massive advantage when they already have the advantage of surprise or high ground. There's a little bit of teleportation as a result right now	 if someone runs through a doorway in front of you they will likely appear in the middle of the room ready to shoot you	 they will definitely be making this better. These devs are working their♥♥♥♥♥off and they've made some really incredible additions to the game. I'm absolutely looking forward to what they'll be adding in the future.SummaryPROS:+Beautiful game+Hardcore survival made fun+Great shooter with excellent bullet physics/penetration+Challenging+Fun game to play with friends+Excellent melee combat that's only in its basic form currently+Separate yet dependent system for network PvP (team deathmatch	 cargo assault	 deathmatch)+Interesting fame point currrency system	 currently only used for joining network pvp (events) or spawning in a specific sector or on your friends or your camp+AI is pretty good in its basic form	 still some issues with occasional zombies phasing through doors	 or mechs seeing you and shooting through doors. 1 Zombie is not hard to deal with	 but multiple is a nightmare	 shooting a gun will attract more to you	 as it should be.+Huge complex metabolism system	 as well as inertia in movement	 your fat character will not be super agile like his thin lanky friend.+Find specific loot where you'd expect to find it in real life.+Complex crafting system+Easy to just move servers and get decent loot within an hour	 granted loot is spawning correctly or there arent people just camping bunkers/airbase.CONS-Optimization isn't great right now	 but it's their main priority and they're working hard on it with progress you can feel from frequent patching. Cities and towns are abysmal for lower end PC's that are above the minimum requirements	 you will stutter hard. There's also a memory leak issue right now that worsens the longer you play	 lowering FPS. High player pop also lowers FPS currently.-Takes forever to meet up with your friends if no one has fame points (hidden blessing that prevents zerging I guess). The map is massive	 your character is limited by his cardio	 energy levels	 and gear weight	 it can take a long♥♥♥♥♥time just to cross over 2 squares on the map.-Sometimes areas get looted and it takes forever  to have anymore loot spawn there.-Zombie AI can be really sparse	 making it hard to find some beginner gear like clothing/boots/hats. They're also a decent source of fame points early on.-Mech AI will see you through walls and shoot you sometimes through said wall causing a very frustrating and avoidable death.-Directional sound	 it simply feels off when hunting	 other than that it sounds great and you can tell where players are coming from for the most part.Overall	 for a game that just released in early access	 7.8 turds rolling down my shelter roof out of 10."

As it currently stands the multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired. Mainly due to most players knowing where to find the high end loot and quickly growing bored of other challenges the game presents	 thus they begin the slaughter of lesser equipped players. The net-code and lag issues also tend to make multiplayer a rather tedious endeavour	 as when you chance upon another player within the incredible 144Km2 map SCUM boasts	 you will find the combat rather clunky and extremely un-immersing due to the issues stated. Thankfully Single Player is available	 allowing you to experience the true breadth of PVE this game will forever continue to throw at you. Whilst I have myself not yet grown bored of SCUM. I find myself distancing from the game as I want to be able to return time and time again to find even more wonderful updates and patches	 that have not only served to improve the overall experience so far. But continue to add more dimensions to this in depth take on survival mechanics.I have played somewhere in the region of 5000 combined hours across multiple survival games. Most notably	 DayZ. Both the original mod and all of it's sub mods as well as the standalone. Already DayZ pales in comparison to this	 the latest edition to the hardcore survival genre. The level of detail is simply staggering	 regardless of how much you research into the game prior to playing it yourself	 you will inevitably become overwhelmed by the vast array of stats the game offers. All of which have an effect on your character in game	 ranging from relatively harmless to stat effecting	 most can even be life threatening. SCUM is extremely punishing to players who do not play with common sense	 would you cross a river to get from A to B in real life? Of course you wouldn't. You're clothes would be soaked through	 which could cause you to get sick. On top of that due to the water they would have soaked up you are now carrying more weight. All of these real life decisions and effects are proudly displayed with incredible detail and precision within the game. The overall graphics quality is also a huge step up compared to what we are used to seeing from previous titles. It reminds me of ARMA III	 only with a more polished feel. The lighting	 enviroment	 and even the foliage is totally immersing. However there is one area I feel could use some improvements. Obviously the game is in beta and not without its share of bugs and glitches. But despite all of this	 my only gripe with the game is the UI	 I find the HUD and inventory/crafting screen rather basic and lacking compared with the rest if the game. I am sure this will be changed at a later date as it does seem to be a little too standard for a game with this amount of detail to stick with. But if I had to make a criticism	 that would be it.Over all SCUM already offers so much more than most other games within the genre. I am greatly looking forward to the future of this game.8.5/10"

Eventually the mountain will be covered with boxes full of feet.10/10 would go to Footlocker again.This game has the potential to be amazing if the developer doesn't take this Early Access cash and run with it.

SCUM nailed it though. The metabolism system is SOOOOO cool. if I could see my own metabolism like this	 I would take so much more care of myself.The amount of effort that the devs are putting in is incredible. I was really sold after watching the tutorial videos. The complexity of the game is soooo refreshing and engaging. Even with a lack of endgame content	 the complexity of managing what I eat and finding components to weapons keeps me so entertained.The deathmatch system is great too. You basically can queue up for a deathmatch game and you'll be teleported to it when it happens and back to wherever you were after it's over. It's a really great way to break up the grind.It's early access	 and there are things that could be (and I'm fully confident WILL be) better. Their roadmap is mighty. And I can't wait to see some of these awesome features. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK	 DEVS! <3"

It feels unnatural and unresponsive. Tried blocking puppet attacks only to zoom in on its face instead. Hopefully this gets some very quick attention and fixes. Core mechanics like this are what can make or break an otherwise very good product.I was really looking forward to this games release but i think the devs spent too much time on too many smaller and (honestly) pointless details. I love a game with depth and realistic survival elements	 but I love a game that has smooth character control more. It honestly made me want to play Miscreated. If this game had character control similiar to miscreated it would be a solid 10/10."

Managing a diet to survive doesn't immediately sound fun	 but once youre educated by a another player or guide	 everything becomes easily managable. So much of SCUMs survival knowledge can be learned through the UI and playing over time. However	 like most of it's competitors	 the quickest way to learn is playing with others. Every player has something unique to learn from if youre able to convince a stranger not to speak with bullets. It's not uncommon to find a friendly player out in the low security zones. But in higher risk zones patrolled by AI guards	 you won't find people so willing for a chat.Surprisingly decent controls and great immersion allow SCUMs gameplay to shine when it counts despite its occasional technical and connection issues	 which the DEVs seem to be good at putting out regular patches to solve.SCUM's worth a try if you're into the genre."

SCUM probably has the most detailed character progression and stat managing system I've ever seen in a game	 the metabolism menu is more extensive and detailed than my doctors medical report of me getting Ligma. You progress by performing certain actions related to the specific stat whether it be shooting	 boxing	 cooking	 survival	 etc. - You don't just get hungry or thirsty in this game	 you get diarrhoea	 hypothermia	 low blood sugar	 vitamin deficiency	 you have to watch your fat	 protein and carb intake. There's a bladder meter when full	 makes you do the ""I have to pee dance"". You can take dumps in sinks!! Definitely the best feature in the game. The Metabolism menu is so extensive and detailed that it even counts the amount of teeth you have left. Premise- You start off in a huge open prison where you're basically apart of some kind of experiment	 you have robot cameras following you	 there are Mech sentries walking about in high loot areas that could kill you instantly and you basically survive and kill others. There are Puppets(Zombies) everywhere that you can kill to gain fame points and clothes or human steaks. There are even events like 10v10 Deathmatches and such that can be organized in the server and contained in a small area	 you join in by paying with fame points. Other than that it's just you surviving alone or making camps with friends and enjoying your time in the world.Personally SCUM is what DayZ and Miscreated could have been if the devs actually put in effort to release the game. I stopped supporting Early Access for a few years because of the scam that was Miscreated but SCUM has brought me back in. Personally I think SCUM has a lot of potential and deserves the attention it's getting now. Ignore the mixed reviews and it give it a chance or come back in a few months time would be my recommendation."

I normally wouldn't even reccomend a game with the issues this game has	 however as a fan of this genre	 this game is already ahead of where DayZ is even after 4 years of development and it's EARLY ACCESS.  Many features are missing but are planned on being implemented.  The devs so far show they want the game to succeed and are seemingly very involved with the community.  Because of this I see a positive future for this game.  Whether you want to spend $20 on a clearly unfinished game is completely up to you.  My view is that the money will help make the game better and I do believe the devs will produce a polished and fun final version of the game (hopfully not 4 years from now hahaha).I personally hate all these early access titles because I feel they make a bad name for themselves right off the bat because people are very over critical of games they KNOW aren't even finished yet.  Honestly they should of waited until 2019 to release a more polished game	 but whatever	 not my business so I have no stakes in the company."

There are some minor things that need to be worked on such as occasional frame drops	 desync	and some other minor issues.

The game needs a major optimization boost	 actual good servers/ dysnc is awful. The zombies have unlimited sprint and do stupid amounts of damage. The mechs either totally miss you or its a one shot insta kill. The majority of the time all you have to do is go to a military zone and get loot making the rest of the aspects of the game useless. Getting geared isnt really rewarding	 Yes you have to sneak past mechs	 but that truly isnt that hard with some timing and paitance. Hackers are all over the servers now Teleporting and just killing everyone and yes an anti cheat has been implemented	 but it is just a cheap one that doesnt do much. The whole system with eating/heart rate and such is very unique giving you more of a survival feel that most games dont have. Majority of the crafting is obslete and certain crafting components don't work. Overall im giving this game a thumbs up as its only in the alpha stage and i can see real potential with the game. Hoping the major things they can fix is optimization and the servers."

This is what we need in a survival game not only did the devs respond within the hours of release they released a whole patch to fix the crashes. i played last night and the game ran smooth beautiful smooth. not once did it crash i haven't played that much do to a sick child last night but tonight its game time. i support this game completely not only is it a survival game but they give you skills and a run down of the entire character metabolism. this gives you something to play for almost like theirs a point to eat certain things and drink certain things to intake certain proteins and calories ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. skills allow you to have something to work towards with your character. very good start (first day) for this game. -Few things i need think need addressed is the movement mechanics prone and running need to be more fluent. -throwing animations-item pick up (double click to pick )things i would like to see in game are:-ability to run and eat/drink unless your at a fountain or water source (bottle drink)-better proneing animations-ability to exit the crafting menu or the inventory while continuing to perform a actionfor example when i go to inventory to select a food to eat im stuck in the inventory menu while i finish eating i would like to at least be able to look around my surroundings.-human sized robots?-different classes of zombies-mission	 task	 or jobs-safe trading zones ? thinks thats gonna be a thing anyhow!

I've also played a LOT of other survival games	 so I can compare it to a lot of what's available right now and tell you how it stacked up.I found the game very challenging	 there was always something to do. I had a hard time finding food	 and was surviving on mushrooms	 but they were really poor as a source of energy	 so my energy was always low. I found a wedge of cheese and the protein and fat was a great boost. I could jog again. And I jogged right into a pair of zombies that almost killed me.The melee combat is really interesting. You can dodge punches	 time your attacks	 it's very	 very cool. I finally stopped playing at almost midnight. I'd eaten mushrooms until I puked	 almost died of hypothermia because I went high into the mountains with wet clothes	 and started with crafting some basic gear and a camp fire.If you're looking for a game like Rust	 this isn't for you. Crafting is more complicated (base building isn't in the game yet	 but is on the road map). Combat is completely different	 you can't sponge hits or bullets. You can't just slap a bandage on your arm in the middle of a fight and keep going. I don't think this game will be popular with streamers who need constant combat because it just doesn't feel like it's going to play that way. Death is permanent. You die	 you have to start from scratch again. If you ever played Arma 3 and thought ""This would be great as a survival game""	 Scum is for you. While there are Arma mods that make it more survival-like	 this game is built from the ground up with the traditional survival elements as an integral part of the fabric.It reminds me a bit of Miscreated as well	 but the zombies here are harder to kill.It's in EA	 but it's incredible already. I had a blast and it's all I can think about right now.10/10 - would eat shrooms till I puke again."

In my experience loot is reasonably easy to come by. The only negatives I've come across are a few occasional bugs where you cant open doors or you will spawn in a slightly different place to where you logged off. Aside from that the man seems solid and might not have the best gunplay right now but it still feels decent. The game will go up from here and it's already better than dayz

I have come across everything from gems in the rough to vaporware	 to outright frueds. SCUM finds itself falling closer to the gemstone end of things. It is by no means a polished diamond sparkling brightly in the sunlight	 but it is definately a game that with just the right work	 and progress	 could become something really speacial.The most important thing in this istance is as always the team behind the game. And from the interactions i have had with them i have reasonable confidence that SCUM will defy its namesake	 and grow into a game that people will happily invest countless hours into.I am not going to get into the mechanics of the game	 or even the content in general	 becuase these are all well above average	 and being that its an early access game	 anything can change between now and full release. What i will say instead	 is that right out of the gate	 this game in enjoyable for what it is. It is a game that is just finding its legs. We dont criticise a child for not being able to run a 10 second 100 meter sprint	 and we dont fire an apprentice for doing something wrong on day one. We give them time	 to learn who and what they are	 and grow into the thing we see beneath the SCUM. Definately reccomend buying the game	 and enjoying it for what it is."

The metabolism system itself is meaningless since doing anything is a hassle	 micro-management included; there's no tutorial	 making a fire became a massive chore	 moving speed is managed through the Middle Wheel	 etc.; making anything takes lots of your precious time.  It's a really slow-paced system.Even without counting all of those issues	 the game itself doesn't offer anything new currently. Again	 metabolism is just some messed-up screen with many pointless indicators.On the good side	 zombies seem to be well made. I battled with one and the combat system is responsive and requires skill. It's also not overpopulated with them	 which explains the above possibility (since few and smart is always better than many and dumb).Moving is also decently responsive	 apart from the speed being managed through the middle-wheel detail. There's a good amount of stamina so you don't bore yourself stopping all the time.I managed to find a deer which escaped when I got close.

I want to wish them luck in the future	 and I want to congratulate them for their success."

Now iv got a few idéas that could mby work or be atlest chanched so this game beacumes more action based and more fun to play for evryone! Now	 one of my idéas is that if you could make a sort of ""Air Drop"" of a kind	 dosent have to be a air drop	 but something that makes the game a bit more ""action filled"" so evryone can fight for the ""loot"". I dosn't have to be like ""super rare"" items of a kind in the drops	 but just the drop so peaple gather towards the ""drop"" and fights for it! Ofcourse sometimes it could have a ""rare drop"" sometimes like lets say  a 8-12% drop chanse for a ""rare item"" (Like a sort of AK	 amo	 sniper	 healing items	 cooked food and so on) you problably understand were im going with this! Now chanches. Now The zombies are cool and all. But a thing that iv notised is that the zombies JUMP way to high and run a bit to fast. Now if you could reduse the speed of the zombies when they run  with maybie	 10% on the ""skinny"" zombies	 and the fat ones are in perfect speed. There was a time were i was about to climb over a wall that was pritty high	 and the zombie jumped all over the wall and killed me. If you  could atlest reduse the Jump a bit so they atlest can't jump over bigger walls/ fences!"

The eating is really complicated but is actually pretty dang good when you figure it out.They added in anti-cheat so I'm changing the review. The devs so far have been proving that they really care about their game and the people that are playing it. They even changed the airport to make it much more difficult for people to get easy loot. Which I am happy to see since people have been trying to abuse it. Keep it up devs. Now the only other issue I need to be handled is the lagging issues on heavier servers. I had a moment where people were just teleporting everywhere and I couldn't defend myself as they beat me and shoot me dead. Pretty sure they were having a difficulty getting to me too but I don't know. They had an easier time getting me regardless.I guess the only thing I can also say on this game is that playing with other people would also be a plus. Be sure to bring your friends along and have a good time~

I'm gonna give the game credit for not being a bad survival game even in the VERY OBVIOUS Early Access point it is in so I would reccomend it but the main problem I am having is even though I am running the reccomended requirements to run the game I am having plenty of problems with frame rate and lag even on low settings and in single player. I'm still going to give it a thumbs up for being very generous with the looting and bits of AI combat here and there compared to other survival games such as DayZ but I just would love to be able to not have so many issues running it in it's current condition.

It is very smooth and quite beautiful. If your system isn't so great	 you can tune down just about everything to make it looks pretty vanilla	 but still have it look great. 2) The concept is pretty awesome and I really like the BCU monitoring. Some of it doesn't seem to function correctly atm	 though. Vitamin D should be produced in sunlight but from what I can tell	 it doesn't. 3) The inventory management system	 while very cumbersome and a bit hard to manage	 is VERY well done and extremely realistic. I think it's better than any other system I've seen to-date. But then there's the bad stuff:1) The recipes are quite limited	 unfortunately. WYSIWYG from what I can tell. I imagine they'll be adding to it	 but for now	 it is what it is. 2) Adding to #1 - there isn't any 'base building' right now. No foundation	 no walls	 doors	 etc. So	 you basically just run around looting stuff	 crafting random things	 and kill whatever things are there. . . 3) After an hour of playing	 if you are playing correctly	 you'll pretty much have all of the end-game items. Rifles	 handguns	 etc. There is a lot to be desired with this game but I recommend it at its current price-point. Once they've expanded on this game and added things to it that should be in it	 this game could be quite amazing. Or	 it might go the way of most EA games when the devs stop developing --- who knows. EA is a dice-roll	 so I guess we'll see. But for now	 $19.99 is a great price for this innovative Survival game."

You die constantly from some one either using cheats or getting killed by the local wildlife but the more annoying part is dying to cheaters.

The developers seem to be trying to keep up with the comments and complaints that are coming from the community. Overall	 the game could use a lot of debugging and polishing and could be fattened up with a lot more content e.g. weapon variety	 armor	 locations. I assume more is coming as this is very early in the development stage.There have been a lot of complaints about hackers	 but it is very likely that an anti-cheat system would be introduced to the game soon.I'd recommend it for its price if you have the money to splash	 as it will get more expensive with time and more content. However if you are short for money	 it is probably better to spend it elsewhere as the early stages of this games development might frustrate you."

As we are only 2 days after release I'm not going to write a full review as there is at least a year of development in early access (and most likely more afterwards.) However I'm making this to try balance out the bizarre outrage some players found themselves in which honestly makes me question most of these peoples intelligence especially when they assume it's going to work perfectly on day one. Considering the fact that I've played 11 hours since release	 I've never experienced a crash is quite a spectacular feat. My performance has been more than acceptable and the development team have already shown they aren't messing around and upon release they had a hotfix out a few hours afterwards.The game itself	 features arguably one of the most in-depth character simulations to date in regards to the entire metabolism system which is fantastic for a survival game but is also an area which has recieved unecessary flak and has been part of the subject of refunds which I flat out cannot understand the reason behind. The dev blogs have been out for months	 the systems and hardcore nature have already been disclosed and yet people are buying the game assuming they are getting another run of the mill survival game like DayZ	 Miscreated or Rust then refunding it because they were too incompetent to read anything about the game. THE SYSTEM ISN'T EVEN THAT COMPLICATED AND YOU CAN STILL PLAY IT WITHOUT ANY GIGANTIC PROBLEMS IF YOU CHOOSE TO IGNORE IT.But such is the nature of early access and the combined stupid might of much of the Steam community. In regards to networking I cannot say I've experienced any major problems (ESPECIALLY WHEN WE AREN'T EVEN A WEEK FROM RELEASE...) and on the subject of hackers this has only recently developed so I haven't experienced anything yet but even if there was an anti-cheat on release day there are still always ways around it. That is the point of a hack.But on the subject of the game briefly	 the environment is enjoyable to explore	 the character system is wonderful	 layered clothing is great	 the developers are funny	 the gunplay needs work but they have plenty of time. Overall it was a lot more surprising and WAY smoother than I thought it would be and I'm excited to follow the development and see what they add. As many have already said	 DayZ is starting to have a much stronger contester. No doubt that after a year of development it could exceed DayZ as it's potential is powerful."

I run everything on MAX and have constant 60+ fps. (I do have a max rig to go along with it	 but that is the price you pay)Graphics are fine with me	 they keep me immersed.Gameplay is excellent	 hardcore survival just the way I like it.The feature of using the scroll to adjust your speed is genius	 give the man that came up with it a cookie.I will recommend this title	 it just released and it has more features and depth than most games and the developers are keeping in touch with the community. They're doing exactly what they're supposed to do and I really hope they will keep it up all the way to the end. This game is what Early Access should be for	 no asset flips or unplayable prototypes.A fun and well functioning game with massive potential.7/10 (But I'm sure it will reach 10/10 when everything is as it should be)For 17€ it's a steal. If you played the DayZ Mod and loved it	 you'll love this.I've played 2 hours so far	 it felt like I've barely started the game.THIS REVIEW MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE"

It is very much like DayZ with a little Escape from Tarkov and even some PUBG elements. You are able to craft a small shelter to spawn at	 and you are able to make small storage boxes for your loot. It is a very punishing game when you die	 unless you have built up enough fame to make life easier upon death via respawn points. Fame is also used to enghage in events on the map such as team deathmatch etc	 which if you win can be very rewarding. I give Scum an 8/10 - it is a great game	 and to launch with so little bugs is very impressive in this particular genre. Although it is similar to a few other games it shines as it's own thing!

Map is huge and that could be both a good and bad thing. Depends on how you look at the aspect of the both.    But overall I recommend the game. It’s got immense potential in it.

It closely resembles DayZ	 until you take a look under the hood and discover things like metabolism and realize	 there's sugar	 water	 fat	 protein	 12 vitamins and 8 minerals to keep care of. And that's just the digestion system. And yes	 it features urinating and pooping too.Then there's the crafting system	 which already rivals DayZ in it's current state (again with the DayZ comparison but that's what comes to my mind as being closest to compare to)And while all this sounds very complex	 the game is fairly easy to get into and to manage (provided you bring at least some survival games experience with you). For example	 the metabolism system	 while presenting you with a huge number of stats to check	 doesn't require you to micro manage. If you eat like a reasonable person you'll be fine. I find myself checking my metabolism monitor only from time to time (got that darn Vitamin D deficiency top watch out for).There's also ""RPG elements"" in that you have basic stats such as Strength	 Intelligence	 Dexterity or Constitution. Those can be tweaked at character creation and control a multitude of skills (eg. survival	 running	 melle fighting	 gun handling).Said skills change during gameplay because repeated use of skills (such as running) will raise their level. On the other hand	 malnutrition	 sickness or injury influence your abilities negatively. All in real-time.Optimization needs work	 but then again	 Early Access. I'd say you'll need at least 16GB ram or deal with stuttering near the bigger locations with lots of buildings. But that may (hopefully) change in the future.Other than that i experienced not a single crash only twice got disconnected and virtually no bugs. It's already quite playable and enjoyable.And then there's the price. Come on. This is a deal. That is	 if you're into this sort of game. This is not PUBG. It requires foresight	 planning and patience."

513710	2	0	Jacob_04	26	3	1	12.9	September 2	 201	i think its a very good game to play with friends untill the servers get more populated but if i could ad one thing now it would be the ablity to cary dead bodies so you can get your loot if you have been shot by one of them scary robos i know you could or shouldnt be able to run full speed but it would be pretty nice also the ablity to see teammates on the map after adding them to squad. there is also a glich where if you sometimes drop items they go outside of the vacinity so you have to go hunting for them

I had my first few hours now in Multiplayer and everything worked very well (minor lags but thats ok) .The understanding in how to craft and how to treat your health and food was a bit confusing but its understandable very quickly. I found some low tier rifles and many meele weapons what made it easy to not die instantly.  It is a young early acces title and you gotta treat it like that. I have some big hope in this game and i think it is a DayZ killer for sure. Lets wait and see what upcoming updates are going to bring into the game.Would recommend 5/7"

Then bought DAYZ SA thinking ""hey	 maybe this game will be pretty good in a year"" and are sat 5 years later thinking ""hey	 dayz just released and update that makes it somewhat playable now but is only available on certain weekends and half the content has been stripped"" then played the new rust and couldn't shake the felling of the old rust being better	 more fun and less tedius. If you are sat there really wanting to play a survival game but don't want to boot up dayz mod because it will take you 19 years to get it working then this might be the game for you. Has;Vaulting	 flawless crafting menu (best I have seen to date)	 loot that actually you know.. spawns	 zombies that aren't completely broken	 fun encounters	 survival feeling	 a event mode so when you think 'huh	 I really wanna kill someone right now' you hit up an event and boom you are in a tdm	 deathmatch	 capture point gamemode all not affecting your survival character. The game is really solid and is the first survival game in a very long time that I actually want to boot up. It's really fun once you understand how things work. At first I thought opening cans	 lighting fires ect were all broken since with a lighter you can't just right click on a fire to light it (like in dayz mod) but in this game you need to highlight both the lighter and the fire to light something. Same with cans ect. You can get a gun quickly once you know what you are doing and overall is an extremly fun and solid game.We do need a first person FOV slider	 depth of field removable outside of editing a config file and gunplay that isn't so weird (the recoil just kinda bounces abit like h1z1 on guns like the akm) but if you really want a good survival game this might be it for you. If someone buys it off of this recomendation and needs help with something don't hesitate to ask	 ill be more than happy to help you. Pst	 the game works better than dayz"

Somehow a dude stumbles across my camp and spears me in the head. Fortunately I had earned enough fame that I can respawn at my camp. As he was looting my boxes I started a punch on. Since he had no weapons we duked it out for a while. I ran low on stamina and somehow he had enough to run away. I let go of the situation and returned to camp in preparation to take on the bunker. It's guarded by two mech sentries. However one of them was bugged out which I rationalised as being a bug in the mech's software. So I was able to slip into the bunker without too much trouble. Tons of military gear. I got a shotgun with ammo	 9mm handgun with ammo and an AK with no ammo. I head back to camp to store my♥♥♥♥♥♥and mr. punching back was back! He speared me in the head again. And yet again I could spawn on my camp. So I managed to race to my body	 grab my shotgun and fired wildly at him as he sprinted through the woods.

This is the fact and deal with it:- peeing&pooping	 vitamins are just lol	 not an immersive experience at all. Just useless systems to differentiate it from DayZ	 nothing more- LACK of content - you can reach the end-game gear in just a few hours. Then nothing to do. Also not many hotspots to loot eg: Airfield or Prison.- fighting and shooting mechanisms are BAD.- servers lags alot (crashes	 etc)- creation of your character it's a JOKE!! Another 'immersive' experience.- no fast transportation option - so ou have to run/walk all over the map like a brainless bot. I love it!- NO co-op mode against environment!!!

So were gonna just hop right onto the bugs because we care more about them and especially if their game breaking right? Their combat system becamed completely ♥♥♥♥ed because people are lagging about tremendously and making Australian's playing on US servers look good. There is an enormous amount of player vs. player lag which makes this game an actual joke at this current state. Another horrible nightmare to go through is crossing a river. Your character would normally go up but gets sucked down or physically won't go up til you reach the other side. So this causes this huge panic will I drown? BIGGEST issue that has arised with the game comes from FPS drops which accumulate through maybe some memory leak? Basically relog into the server and badaboom your LAG VANISHES. Your welcome on that one. The server side lag for people in combat your ♥♥♥♥ed killed a very geared player while laughing it off. Poor guy hates me and I hate me but were even right? I love you guys hope I help some poor soul thinking about buying it. Maybe watch more gameplay. Enjoy the fantasy but the load of ♥♥♥♥♥ people are taking in game are stinking it up like High hell baby.

Adding to the immersion of the game you find that ""failure to defecate"" can have disasterous consequences at the most inopportune time.If the survival genre is of interest to you	 and if you don't have a weak stomach then I would say this game is a must have.Packed full of: isolation	 wandering	 looting	 crafting	 teaming	 shooting	 stabbing and bodily functions"

This game focuses a lot on survival and keeping your character in good health. The game is early access and obviously doesn't have a lot of content at this stage	 but the game runs great apart from a few issues:1. It has a memory leak so you'll lose FPS over time. 2. Some descync problem that has now been fixed	 but I expect it to return as development progresses.There's enoug content to keep the explorer in your entertained for a while	 but don't spend too much time playing it in early access because you'll get bored	 since not that much content is available yet.Pace yourself if you like this game. Don't make it your primary game just yet."

The aspect of survival is very developed	 you have to monitor every single function of your body	 from vitamins to avoiding to start to poop during combat. This game is not PVP	 and it is pure fun. Sure	 you have to run around for quite a while to find players	 but when you do it's mostly rewarding (if you kill them of course). Yet i don't find problems in the shortage of PVP	 because you really focus on trying to keep your character alive	 loot	 hunt	 not to run around spraying bullets like in battle royale games. I still keep finding new things and items	 and that amazes me. There is a bunch of skills	 and the mastery is not easy	 but it keeps the fun	 as you don't have to grind one skill at a time	 because that is simply not possible. It is not easy to learn	 it is not easy to play	 yet as you play	 you find yourself very immersed in the gameplay. You have to be slow and thoughtful to really do anything else besides fainting. All in all	 if you are looking for a battle royale game	 this is deffinitely a skip	 yet if you want a challenge and to have some fun solo or with your friends in a gigantic map full of things to do	 this is a reccomend for you."

In my absolute surprise the desync was completely fixed. Me and my friend could see each other's and other players' movements perfectly. Still 20-25 fps. Also	 anti-cheat.TodayGot in to play despite crap fps because I enjoy the game nonethelessIn my absolute surprise (again) I get 40-60 fps (had constant 88 fps at some point). I had so much fun because I could PvP and PvE smoothly.A few points:I love the realistic physics. The moment a bullet hits a zombie's head it dies and falls on the ground. Stable servers make that possible.The devs listen to the community.Constant updates since release. Shows that devs are not lazy and I love them for that. They are giving their all into advancing this game to the next level.Not many crafting and building depth yet but they've already said that they're putting these in the future.Why I recommend this game in its CURRENT state:It's really fun and enjoyable as it is right now.To support the devs in order to make this game a masterpiece as it shows a lot of promise.

The metabolism system is great	 it informs you with in depth stats on your character and how totrack food intake and what your character is lacking. PvP is a little hit and miss with the servers currently lagging and bad optimization	 but all in all a decent experience.For those with low-mid end systems like mine	 expect lag	 stutters and frame drops.

If you are one of those types	 I wouldn't recommend the game just yet.  It's first day of early access and they may add smaller maps or larger server populations.    Right now it's like Rust 2.0.  A combination of old Rust with the zombies and new Rust with the Mechs (instead of AI tanks) but without any base building.

Im fine with this	 its good fps for the game it is. Consider the fact that from a mountain quater a grid away or more	 you can still see and shoot people at the airfield. Negatives:New people with no / Low Fame Points would have to run across map to meet up withs friends in some cases. I've already ran across map 3 times. - Cars would be nice.Mechs are buggy	 sometimes able to shoot through walls / see through walls. Super OPLoot seems unbalanced. Easy start if you run to a mili bunker and just slip past the mech. Should have some sort of attraction for fresh spawns to go to	 instead of straight up end game loot easy to get. I suggest a slightly guarded town	 eg 1 mech and a horde of puppets	 with better loot and some ""Personal Bunkers"" civilians would have stocked up of food and pistols etc.All in All	 a great experience playing the game so far and I hope the Devs continue to work on it and perfect.Devs are doing a great job thanks for the awesome game."

I have a pretty old system and although I have most settings on low i'm still at 50+ fps in dense places and 60+ in open places which for me is playable. {Specs}~ CPU: I5 6600k~ RAM: 16GB DDR4 ~ GPU: Nvidea 970~ And a fairly basic motherboard and HDDEven with only 3 hours in the game I can strongly recommend this game and urge you to buy it before it goes up in price like Ark did."

This game is no where near its final state and if it were to be labelled	 it should still be in ALPHA. I would take an educated guess and say that approximately 70% of this game is broken and renders it unplayable at the moment.I quickly ran out of things to do after crafting a stone knife	 spears and backpack. I have no idea why they have sentury's in this game but whatever	 it's an alright twist i suppose. Makes it different. But once you get your gear at a military spot	 theres obsolutley nothing left to do. I mean	 you can't really shoot players because one of two problems occur. One	 you can only see a couple of guns walking around or two	 the D-Sync is MASSIVE to put it lightly. This makes the PVP portion of the game rediculously unfathomable.This game needs to be optimized on every level. No way should my rig be getting max 30 fps with all settings put on lowest. I understand that optimization is one of the final touches to be made before a game is considered complete	 but this is not acceptable in the slightest.All in all	 I would consider this game a failure	 and trust me	 this makes me sad since I was really routing for this game and couldn't wait to put my hands on it. I just feel like this is another cash grab. The positive side is that I can see the Devs regularly updating the game but even there	 all I see are minor bug fixes and that's it.Keep in mind	 this is my opinion thus far and I really hope they can prove me wrong in the near future."

For early access and especially given the current price point this is a win all day long!  I went into this blindly knowing little to nothing about SCUM I watched a view videos about the game literally a day before its early access release.  After watching those videos I thought the game looked interesting.  When I saw it was only 20 bucks I was impressed and when I logged in to see just how much was already there for 20 bucks I was blown away.  If Rust	 DayZ	 and PUBG had a baby that would be SCUM.  The basic mechanics of the game are SOLID even for early access.  Moving	 mantling	 and fighting are fluid and animations are done nicely.  The graphics are beautiful however taxing to say the least.  The interface is different - but once you get accustomed to it - it works!  There were hackers on the first day unfortunately but the developers addressed it within a day or two and I have not experienced it since.  The game obviously has a LOT more in store if you take a moment to review some of the skills and attributes that are grayed out to date.  Some people were crying the map is too big IT'S NOT.  With how the crafting system works in this game you need the time not looking over your shoulder 100% of the time.  Overall the game has been a blast to play and discover.  Yes it needs work - what game doesn't?  Again I see great value in this game at the current price point.  Things I'd like to see in the future: ability to aim / shoot straight up (so to engage targets in escape hatches and ladders)	 ability to search / loot a body under water	 perhaps a later game way to track / show grouped up players on the map (radios/gps?)	 further optimization.  I'm running the game on an i7 6700k with a 1080ti @ 1440p epic and getting 60fps."

There's a decent sum of content that is still being made. But that should be understandable concidering it's in early access. If I was you	 I'd pick it up so you can learn the game before more stuff is added. And It's only $20. So it Isn't expensive. Although who knows if that'll change."
513710	0	0	TheGamingPandaHD	211	1	1	36.4	September 3	 201	"I bought this game as soon as it came out and i can say it is definitely worth the $20. The game has features from many different games especially dayz and if you used to play dayz then this may be the game for you	 scum uses the unreal engine and looks amazing	 graphics are definitely a 10/10. The worst part about this game right now is desync/network lag	 player teleport all over the place making melee combat very difficult. FPS is'nt too great either as with a 1070 on 1440p medium settings i get 35-50fps so lower teir graphics cards like the 1050 wont hold up very well. As far as content goes it is very much like dayz and there are underground bunkers scattered around the map guarded by mechs that contain military loot which are worth looking for and looting	 when vehicles are added to the game it will make travesing the map much quicker. I'd say scum is worth picking up as the price is going to increase as more content is added. Playing solo can be fun but with a friend is much better like with most games."

Played for an hour - aimlessly running around avoiding zombies and bears	 After crafting the basic necessities	 like a stone knife	 bag	 hatch ect... I feel like Im ready to stand up and face this game head on. Off I go collecting everything I find	 built a shelter and a couple of storage boxes. Full to the brim with guns	 ammo	 ropes and skins. I even found a military bag and a rifle. After 3 and a half hours of playing and it being 4am I decided to call it a night. I put everything into the boxes and returned to the main screen... turned off the PC...Started the game up today to carry on with this amazing survival game..... I spawn a few feet from the H on the map (Meant to be your resawpn point after you craft one).... I get there......... Everything........ Eveything is gone. Hours of looting scavaging saving fighting and healing down the pan.Now	 I get his is a survival game	 but this isnt something you play for 45 minutes and your the biggest/strongest badA** out there. This is no sprint (not for me at least) so why oh why  would you not make sure the single player allowed you to keep you stuff.

They have amazing lighting and graphics although hopefully they can improve fps on lower end pc. I was amazed when I found a horse and how beatiful she appreared in the open fields. Cannot wait to tame the horses because it was kind of sad to shoot the horse then beat it to death. Overall there are some great moment and if they polish the game It will be unforgettable experience. The idea of farming crops and vehicles will add to the drama of surviving. Hopefully they can add some even more intelligent ai. I rate this game 8 out of 10 so far only because it is early access. 10 out of 10 if they polish the game with possibly differewnt map sizes. Some people may like smaller maps to get into the action a lot faster rather than roaming and looting all the time. Personally I like this map size but have friends that would differ."

513710	1	1	JannieWH	74	1	1	15.1	August 30	 201	"This game is really good in my opinion. It has a lot of potential.One thing I see a lot about in other reviews is the inability to run far before out of stamina and hungry really fast. It is in early access so there is of course things still missing. If you buy this game expecting it to be perfect then shame on you. It is very important you don't just skip through character creation. When making a character you assign points to certain skills. Skills like boxing	 handgun handling	 melee weapon	 running etc. The points you get depends on the age of your character that you can also choose. If you skip through character creation and later on complain about not being able to run much or whatever	 then I'd say that is your own fault; afterall ""knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival."" When I had made my character	 24 years old	 I spawned pretty much in the middle of nowhere. And like any other new game I had to learn the basics. After that I started to run towards the nearest town. Got knocked out by a wild boar	 bastard. Didn't die though. I started to interact with trees and bushes and the ground. I gathered a few rocks from the ground and was able to craft a primitive knife. I was then able to kill a zombie	 with my bare hands as I set my boxing skills to medium. When it was dead I searched it	 gathered it's clothes	 chopped the body	 chopped the body parts	 took the human meat and some fat. At this point my character was very hungry and had 0% energy	 so I knew I had to cook the meat fast. I figured out how to make a fire	 from the crafting menu. And started cooking some food. I was then able to regain stamina faster and that helped with later zombies. I have only played this game for 65 minutes so my journey hasn't been long. But I definitely look forward to playing it some more	 learning as I go. I highly recommend trying it out for little less than 2 hours	 if you hate it get a refund."

After pumping only 150 hours into day z	 and 300+ into miscreated I waited for scum to release	 well over 8 months! The fluidity in the game is the most satisfying thing. And by this I mean the controls. No clunky day z “V” vault over a fence! Lovely smooth vaulting animation. At the minute Loot is everywhere	 I had 3 fully loaded guns with extra ammo	 mags in less than an hour. Which does take away the survival aspect from the game. But my understanding is that the game needs tested	 PvP needs tested	 guns etc to find problems if they arise so they can be fixed and improved. I’m hoping in a few months time the loot will become more scarce like it would be in real life! I don’t know how ANYONE can give this game a bad rating just hours in and the FACT it’s in DEVELOPMENT EARLY ACCESS bizarres me. The game is 15 quid.

If you never played DayZ I can understand why you have some issues with the game but if you did the feeling of WOW they put ALL the things that DayZ devs promised for years and could NOT deliver. For example	 good zombie & animal A.I	 Lootable containers	 jumping into windows	 jumping out of ladders	 wearing multiple cloths	 Picking up items while Tabbing	 accurate and better melee. Tons and Tons of little quality of life that doesn’t impact the hardcore aspect of the survival game mechanics. And The Metabolism screen Oh My God – this is quite amazing how everything work together and it’s actually science based. And everything is right here ont eh first days of their Early Access and more content	 features and patchs to come. Uninstalled DayZ (hopefully for the very last time).My only hope that Croteam and Gamepries will not ruin their own game but cheap monetization and keep making SCUM what it can evolve into – the De-facto Open world Survival game."

Guns are not easy	 and not hard to obtain. There is a lot to the game that I still haven't explored. GOOD - Gameplay is smooth	 graphically rich and runs like a dream	 content and crafting is amazing. Golden showers on team mates. Pooping on teammates. Entire thin and fat system with heart rate and food consumption needs. Scopes are incredible as it says wind speed	 length from target. BAD - A little stutter here and there and server disconnects maybe once or twice in a 8 hours sessions. Took a minute to learn the crafting system. This is just a fun game meant for people who enjoyed DayZ and H1Z1 with a little bit of Tarkov involved. It is a survival game but your not going to die	 starve	 or dehydrate as soon as you log in. You are able to travel and not worry to much as there is a good amount of resources to use around you."

Turns out it's all just superficial complexity for now. All you actually have to do for survival is kill the first zombie you see	 cut him into pieces and eat the raw steak he drops. Then stop at the first stream you see and spam drink for 5 mins. Congrats you beat the survival portion of the game	 onto the pvp. The pvp........ people are walking around at 1 fps teleporting 20 feet at a time	 It's REALLY bad. So there is little to no challenge to survive and pvp is unplayable what's there to do?

No support for 3440x1440. You can play the game	 but you can't craft. The menu is cut off and the only way to play is either in a compressed	 ♥♥♥♥♥♥	 pixelated resolution	 or in windowed mode which is cancerous on an UW. For a resolution becoming more and more prominent (especially with games running UE4 ffs)	 there should be no reason as to why something so obvious was overlooked	 and not even tested.. Can't say I recommend the game to anyone with an ultrawide at the moment. And the combat is also trash. No hit registration when you're literally ♥♥♥♥ing the zombie in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't get any closer	 yet they can hit you with no problem. Until these two major issues are addressed	 I can't say I recommend anyone spend the $20 as of yet	 if they're looking to play the game with little frustration.

I love that a survival game makes the environment is the number one enemy	 and not the other players. The loot isn't like in DayZ where you have to play for 2hrs to get a gun. The game is somewhat fast paced	 but not too fast. ofc on an early release/early acces there will be problems and with this game there sertainly is. The pvp combat is just unplayable! Other players just warp around! You can't enjoy a gun or a melee fight. But i love the idea of the 'mechs' who patrol the military areas. But their AI is so bad they will shoot you or see you when you're behind a corner or inside a house. I think there should be more of those mechs like a smaller walking one that will spot you and sound like an alarm what will alarm other players and the bigger mechs. But even with these 'bugs' i still love the game and if you havent buyed it yet DO IT! It's only 20€ It became one of my favourite games the moment i started it. And one thing. make the boxes moveable. But in my opinion the game is 4/5 because of the ai and pvp problems. Once they fix it it will be 5/5."

A lot of the bad reviews are from noobs that dont understand EARLY ACCESS	 theres gonna be bugs (hardly any) and balance tweaks and stuff thats the whole point. Right now i play solo living off the land	 going to town scavaging for supplies killing walkers and befriending other survivors.  Its as if the walking dead were a game you could play.  Everything you eat effects your body.  Put on too much gear you run slow.  Dont poop or pee	 you do it uncontrolably.  Its so realistic but still fun"

Like a true survival game	 SCUM has a level of difficulty and discovery that makes every step forward feel like an achievement all on its own!Scum is as close as I have seen to a realistic survival simulator	 but also has fictional threats. It does a very good job of creating a sense of impending doom.SINGLE PLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER MODES! Finally	 a game that is really fun to play	 that I can play with my friends	 and when they need to log off	 I can continue by myself! So many games being created lately are just one or the other. It's refreshing to have the option.Crafting is quite detailed and complex! It's like a puzzle! ""I have to make these before I can make this	 and I need this to make that!"" I love complicated crafting systems.Graphics are exellent.Map size is very large! Lots to explore!Negatives;Zombies. Now remember	 I said at the start	 this is an opinion peice. In my opinion	 the zombie theme in games has been done to death! *cough*...   It would just be nice to see something new. It's purely asthetic	 as it would be easy to skin the zombies as aliens	 or wild animals	 or whatever.Suggestions for Improvement:Inventory management is a little clunky	 and sometimes not obvious as to how many slots are required for an item	 so you have to shuffle things around a lot to figure it out. This is a very minor negative	 as it just means you end up taking a little extra time gathering items sometimes.Map is very large	 which is fine! It would be nice however if you could zoom in on areas a little bit just to get a slightly more clear perspective of where you are!The crafting system is very need	 and well executed for a beta version! It could use a little more streamlining though so players know what they need to gather and acquire to make what they want/need.Guns are a little awkward to use still. Not really sure what I would reccommend to change it for the better	 just pointing it out.The single wild bear I have encountered in the game so far ran faster than a vehicle on a highway at me. While yes	 bears can run very fast	 that was a little excessive! Was entertaining to watch though!Very fun	 I expect to lose a lot of hours in this world	 and look forward to what other things they may introduce to the game! For an Early Access title	 I would give it a solid 8/10. A great game as is	 lots of room for improvement!Well done Gamepires	 Croteam! I do believe you're sitting on a potential gold mine here!"

ATM the game is a big tease. At least most of the time.In many aspects	 SCUM is a simulator. Primarily a dying-simulator without any feedback. That means you'll have to go for trial and error and often enough you won't understand what happened.My first death came after eating a melon.My second came shortly after eating canned spaghetti.Then I was on my way to meet with some friends and died midway without knowing why.Next time I wasn't able to find any water in time so i died of thirst.Respawned with zero water in my body and too far away from any water source. Dead again.Next time I got shot by another player.Meanwhile my reputation was way beyond zero so I had to wait ages for a respawn.When I died two additional times in the middle of nowhere not knowing why (my stats were fine and at least by ingame feedback I didn't get shot) I uninstalled and refunded. I consider myself to be somewhat frustration-resistent	 but ATM scum is too much for me.Again	 don't get me wrong. This game has a lot of potential which sadly isn't there yet. I'm looking forward to the game in the future and I hope for some more feedback that lets you know 'why' you died."
513710	2	1	kinghunt3k	753	15	1	20.6	September 1	 201	"Ok	 how to start? 1st Please IGNORE THE MIXED REVIEWS if you go through the negative comments	 90% are silly reviews with players with less then 2 hours of gameplay - mostly coming from BR gamers. Playing the game motivated me to write this review	 which is something i rarely do.  I will only give you topline headers for the major factors in this evaluation	 without diving in little useless details. TDLR :SCUM starts were all other failure survival games end. As an EA title 1st week of launch	 it already surpasses games like DayZ. Unlike the recently canceled JS.  SCUM adds proper survival elements together	 with zombies that actually work. If you are a survival veteran. Scum is the game you have looking for for some time now.Current issues:You can not host your own servers on your own machines or dedicated servers - if you want you will have to use single hoster ( Nitrado ) and we all know how bad Nitrado shared servers are. they affect performance big time - choices are limited and expensive	 you are also bound to server locations this monopoly hoster offers. For me	 it is a big drawback. Developers need to realize this issue asap and open the game for public hosting.   Cheaters.Day one cheaters are here and they are doing their usual thing	 destroying the entertainment for everyone else. this issue needs to be dealt with ASAP.The Promise :Once base building  ( base fortifications and capture ) are implemented	 skies are the limit for this amazing survival game. Vehicles:Same as the above	 vehicles are not yet deployed to the current build of the game	 but once they are	 many of the "" walking simulator "" crybabies u see here will hopefully stop complaining.ConclusionIn a nutshell	 this is by far one of the best survival games out there with heaps of potential. Despite being very early in development.  it currently shows that the developers are not a bunch of headless idiots trying to make a quick buck. They are straight players like us and understand the mechanics of survival games properly."

Get shot in the butt because I got busted in the barracks building while in crouch	 figure out i'm bleeding out	 and have to patch my wounds.

I haven't ran into many bugs	 except for a few aesthetics	 like temporary glitching of the sky graphic.  For me	 it's been much more polished than many early access games	 but keep in mind that you will probably run into a few early access issues at some point.  Survival is paramount and they've made it a unique experience that draws on games like Rust	 terraria	 the forest	 etc.	 but has many of its own aspects	 like the metabolism system that breaks down food	 water	 and nutrient consumption.  But	 for anyone who isn't really interested in that side of things you can just forget most of it and just eat things when you come across them.  Survival in this game mostly relates to staying alive and well from fights and making sure to use clean bandages.  PVP is really fun	 both in the regular game and an event-style gameplay.  The events are kind of like an Instance	 where you essentially teleport to a dedicated pvp zone and play a deathmatch/team-deathmatch.  At the end of the event you teleport back	 no harm to your gear or character.  I don't see many people using this	 mostly because there were gsync issues but last night I did a couple of events and didn't have any issues.  Looking forward to more!"

It's very intense at times... i mean	 i only tried the singlepayer mode	 but damn it's a propper reaslistic zombie surivival game. Only thing i would like to see for the fututre is strong focus on not only the crashes that i encounter when doing hardly anything but running/walking or searching for stone	 i would also like to have in the future a possibility to make better weapons like a bow	 or a sling shot. Finding a weapon is most likely insanely hard	 but making bows or using small stones as sling shot ammo would be awsome. I don't know if i'm not wrong	 maybe there's a slingshot in this game already	 but dman i need a ranged weapon to kill anything really	 it's really hard to attack anything just like real life xD"

Items on the ground are all but invisible due to foliage and no highlighting or glow	 and the ""vicinity"" inventory is not a sufficient solution as its range is a joke and it gives no indication of where your items are actually lying around.  On top of that	 every item (including chests!) disappears every time you log off	 even in single player.  And then there's the fact that any time you want to move more than one large-ish item at a time	 you have to drop all your weapons (which then become impossible to find again and/or despawn) while you craft and uncraft ""bundles"" over and over.  It's horrible.  Did they even playtest internally?Also	 combat is clunky (on the verge of glitchy	 though I think it's just bad design working as intended).  Your character has a very hard time actually completing his attacks when under attack... kinda a problem.  So you just end up half-punching the air over and over until you die from the zombies that don't seem to have this problem.  Blocking doesn't really do much	 though it helps a tiny bit.  An overhaul is badly needed.SCUM does have promise.  The complex nutrition simulation is very impressive	 and the premise of the game is cool.  I'll consider rewriting my review later in development if they fix these glaring issues.  But as it stands now	 the game is nearly unplayable."

I had 2 hostile encounters so far and each one was laggy as hell with both us of each time flying from spot to spot. i feel the first guy was having the same issue as he eventually ran off. The second guy shot me dead no issues hahahhaha! I watched some streams where it seems to run kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ during some other peoples battles too...it's Early Access so there is obvious work to do!

Unfortunately that's all the positives I can say about SCUM. The environment is littered with zombies who are just as deadly as those in other titles	 but they are only one of the treats that face players beyond other ""humans"" in the game	 because the military bases that litter the map are patrolled by massive robots who are eagle eyed enough to spot intruders	 even when they are covered by the defilade of terrain. When these robots do see you	 their guns will mow you down at almost any distance with pin point accuracy. If you think that you should arm yourself before going to these high risk areas on the map	 think again	 because the military bases are the only place where you can find military gear and weapons. There is no right time to head into a mil-base. A pleb has just as much of a chance as a seasoned player to make in and out of these hot zones.In the end	 I already own two other titles that offer me this kind of game play who are also much farther along on their development. All in all the meta information and game are just another ""rehash"" of the zombie/survival genre with very little to set it apart from other more seasoned titles. If 20$ is all you have to spend	 save it; because the average player will come away frustrated or board out of their minds."

And then you encounter a zombie..... booring.. Would be so much better if it was a NPC according to the location. For example a hunter in the tiny houses in the woods	 having a day/night ritual (sleep at night	 roam in the day). or citizens in the towns. for all those zombie lovers	 they could even make an area where they escaped or something. This is just running eating zombies and randomly dieing by a spear or shotgun. Hope they build much more in this game	 then i'll try it again. It has SO much potential!"

I am playing solo on a multi server and i do think it would likely be more enjoyable if you played with others but I'm still having a blast.I would recommend watching some of the YouTube videos the developers put out to understand how every thing works and comes together because it is overly in depth. At its core it is hardcore survival. Which I thoroughly enjoy. There are other things such as pvp	 zombie like creatures and military grade robots peppered in. Also there ar deathmatch	 CtF and other events you can partake in to mix things up. If you enjoy a challenge and are open to something a little different but like hyper realistic games it's well worth the 20 dollar EA intro price."

You meet the same awful people that you do in most survival games	 You can freshly spawn & meet another player & have NOTHING of value & be killed and called names.It's another ""Death Match"" survival game that takes place on a huge island map. On top of that	 there isn't really anything to do in the open world. Wait.. There are events you can take part of that are honestly just basic lame deathmatches. The A.I that you meet as you explore is also quite awful & sometimes unfair.What do I mean by that? The robots in this game really DON'T BELONG THERE! They will shoot you through surfaces & 180 no scope you without doing any type of animation of them turning to aim at you. The zombies are quite alright as long as you're shooting at them cause	 the melee combat in this game is really.. Flat & dull	 nothing to really see here.Save your money & wait for the game to get more love! it really needs it	 It runs alright on my GTX 1070 but does need some optimization work.

Thirdly it is not another battle royal clone. It's more like a DayZ with a larger focus on survival (e.g. body stats; minerals & vitamins) plus some enemy mechs in addition to the zombies. SCUM is an open island survival game set in a near future. The idea with the prisoner island survival show is good	 but has to be expanded as well as the max player count of 64 per server. The map is really big and as there aren't 200 players on each island the devs put in a special zone for DM/TDM	 which is at least a start for now. What you get is a lot of exploring	 searching	 looting	 crafting	 figuring stuff out and some killing besides the pooping - in a beautiful looking and shaped world. In total Scum feels like a more accessible and more advanced DayZ in almost every way	 especially when compared to its' early access release. For an alpha	 the state of the game is really good(!)	 also compared to a lot of other early access titles I played on their release - don't belive the nitpickers. Hopefully SCUM will develop in terms of keeping the excitement after there's nothing left to explore (see planned features)?! SCUM needs something which makes itself unique besides and on top of the magnificent character stats - the potential is there.Pros:+ great character metabolism system+ very good gameplay+ very good vegetation/forests/landscape+ good graphics+ good controls+ good sound+ good atmosphere*+ good amount of content (for an alpha)+ no server hoping!+ really fair price tag+ map is much bigger than you think!+ reconnecting works and is smooth&fast+ intricacies like crafting on the floor instead of in the backpack+ good performance (1440p all maxed out @GTX1080	 3770K	 16GB)Cons:- missing features- (few) bugs/crashes- unknown longterm fun- indoor soundsystem needs improvements- see my wishes & features of 1.0 for what's missing & coming- *missing adrenaline rush (for me) as in DayZ/PUBG/EscapeFromTarkovWishes:?! 100+ players?! special missions/tasks?! different zombie types?! more birds and wildlife?! a more daunting atmoshpere?! improved indoor sound acoustics?! improved texture quality e.g. of rocks?! dangerous insects	 weather changes	 etc.?! randomly generated locations (villages/houses)?! a ""transfer""-best-player/squad island system (for equality)Verdict:Finally a game where you don't have to do♥♥♥♥♥♥VSync	 Resolution & Fullscreen Fix  ...see the comments."

(I know it's EA	 though it's worth mentioning still	 it is a review after all	 eh?)So my views on this game aren't really biased.Starting off I can just about say it's probably worth the however many hours you put into this game	 for it's price tag £15 (probably about $20?) though any more and I think you'd be pushing it	 the only reason I have it was because I was in for a new game and this just seemed to be a good price and I knew a few friends who were also going to grab it.So far it's had some fun times	 hysterical times and also some not so good times.. like being hoarded by zombies and stuck in a corner	 or one-tapped by the overpowered Mech Robots.. even through a wall sometimes or just dying from stupid things like falling off a ladder after you click to go down it.Personally the looting system is really not great.. I don't mind the idea of searching everything I wouldn't doubt in saying it improves FPS a lot however having to put a backpack on to see whats inside is tedious and slow and just infuriating	 the same when you want to move/swap something in your inventory? Nah	 gotta drop it and then switch it	 no easy swapping here to organise your inventory!Moving to the PVE elements.. the zombies are 'okay' and the mechs add a bit of intensity .. but they are SO overpowered at the moment	 even the zombies can get you stuck in a corner or just randomly throw punches. Personally they need to remove the MECHS OR ZOMBIES	 and not have both - I'd prefer the mechs only	 due to them being so different (Not a DayZ Clone) and remove zombies because they don't really make much sense anyway as to why they are in the game.Lastly	 the survival elements	 you can have some fun times finding food	 killing animals and cooking it - however I think the options for crafting is a little bit small	 you can craft a bag and some bullets or something to put your meat on the fire to cook and thats about it really - the survival elements don't make much sense yet (I barely know when to eat	 drink	 how to get energy	 or to even sh** and pi**.. but I guess that'll come with experience).I think the verdict is probably for £15	 if you're not TOO attached to your money	 go ahead get it	 you can always refund it if you don't like it - but it's not a half bad game for the price	 there's definitely worse.. I'm sure (hoping) the developers will continue to improve it and implement a lot more stuff in the near future and I'll enjoy the ride.. if I don't get too frustrated being shot through walls that is !"

The ""Metabolism"" tab does provide a flashy overview of all your vitamins	 minerals and other nutrients	 but	 even though the nutrients are consequential to what you can afford to do and where you can or can't go... in the end it's of very little importance	 since you'll just eat whatever's available to you anyway regardless of nutritional bias.That said	 the game is still deprived of content. Once you got around to learning the mechanics	 there's not much left to do other than stroll around in the world and get into fights with the occasional player you run into	 but to be honest... I was so happy to finally run into a player that I befriended him and had a bit of a chat rather than kill & loot.Once the game has it's fortification/building system in place	 their ""advanced team mechanics"" (w/e that means) and their mission system	 it'll probably be a king in the genre	 but right now... it ends up being a bit boring."

The answer is yes	 for hours and hours.  Lots to learn about crafting and character management.  Lots of the world to explore	 different places to loot	 and enemies to kill.  Is this game worth the money at this point?  Again	 unqulaified yes.  Developer is busy making regular updates and the potential of this game is amazing with the right support.  Compared to other games at the same point after release in early access	  this game is a peach.  With  the right support	 this will be a really greart survival game.I do hope the devs balance the combat a little bit.  When the improvised spear is better at killing puppets then an MP5	 assuming more than one mob is attacking you	 there is room for improvement.  But this is an early balance issue and when taken together with all the other hard work they  have put into this thing	 I got nothing but love for you.  Thanks for the game."

513710	1	0	JnKTechstuff	73	3	1	31.7	September 7	 201	"What to dislike:- Running simulator (vehicles coming soon)- Glitchy pvp (shooting feet through walls)- The camo system needs to be tweaked (when peeking around walls the pop in is way too late)- Spawning next to team is not available until you play enough to achieve 100 fame. Need a way for new spawns to spawn together.- Close PvE is a bit glitchyWhat to like:- Deck out weapons- Challenging loot areas around military installations- Solid PvP- Good medical system (not as hard as DayZ	 and way more infomative)- Good performance (970 at 50-60 fps	 all high to epic settings)- Quick updates (the lag issues were resolved in a day or two after initial)Overall if you liked dayz	 this is your type of game. I put many hours into DayZ and this is a brand new release with better performance	 content	 optimization	 and PvP/PvE than DayZ"

I have had some issues with falling trough the map and delays when openning doors	 looting etc.Other issues and thoughts:-The hall doors at the bootcamp have a gap trough wich the sentries can spot and shoot you. The gap itself is so small that you need to line up carefully to see trough it and you only see a little.-Like many other people i feel like there is a problem with looting in the game. There is no point in going to the cities to loot	 all you need to do is to go to a bunker / military base and you have all you need there. Food is easy	 just kill an animal you have tons of meat and fat	 and becouse you only get a small penalty for eating raw meat (diarrea) there is no point cooking it either. So basically you can just run between two military bases and kill animals on the way for food to get the best loot in the game.-There should be an option to change fov and dof in game rather the from the game files.-I combat spawning on a squadmate with no delay is a problem	 if there was a 1 min - 5 min delay depending on the amount of respawns on a squadmate in a certain amount of time this would not be a problem. This would make combat better when you dont have to constanty kill the same guy who keeps spawning to his squadmate who is camping behind a rock.-Comming from playing csgo for a few yeas the game feels a bit stiff to play but this is something i can get used to.-I dont know if a thing like this will work in the game but removing the sentries from the large military bases would turn them into high intensity combat areas where there is an even larger risk reward ration than right now with the sentries. If you manage to kill a player who has been there for some time and killed many people and looted he will drop large amounts of high tier loot. Staying longer means more better loot but a higher chance of bein killed in the process. Maybe this could be achieved with out removing the sentries im not sure but i think this has some potential.These few issues dont make me give this game a bad review but it keeps me from giving it 10/10 either. The core gameplay is great and with a few tweaks here and there this game will be a huge hit in the survival community"

And after you've got everything there is no real point of continuing. I think that there needs to be a few things added. If you take the Arma 3 mod Exile for example	 it's also survival with looting	 but there is also;*Base building*An economy system with traders*Pvp- hotspotsThis proves more rewarding because you can actually do things with your gear	 like kill players (You can still do this in Scum	 but there are not many pvp-hotspots)	 sell it for money to be used elsewhere or build a base and store it (Again	 you can do this is Scum but it's very limited.)If some of these things would be added it would make for a much better game."

We reached out on an open coms channel an spoke to their group leader ""ECHO"" to form a plan of rescue when out of no where a group of guys try to take on the mech	 in frantic panic we thought we were been shot at by the mech till we heard the  attacking group speaking on the open coms channel.They got pinned down by the mech while ""ECHO'S"" group got out of their building we then flanked the mech	 so the new group could get to safety but the mech wasn't having any of it and killed the attacking group who helped free ""ECHO'S"" group.Witnessing what we did we realized our attempts were futile an retreated back where we got more familiar with each other over a camp fire an some good food and drink	 we waited for day break an headed out to gather the loot from the guys who just died trying to help	 as we were gathering their loot 3 of them awoke from the dead as the undead an attacked us luckily we took them out with no casualty's.We spoke among each other working out how this happens as we separated the loot ""ZON"" said something that rang true with me about the virus plague that has taken the island over	 he said the only way to stop this from happening was to chop the bodys up so we did this. Our hands and body's drenched in the blood of our unknown friends took a toll on our minds that day and things would never be the same again.On our next day we set out to create a base camp in the mountains where we came across a bear who charged us out of no where we pulled our shotguns out an put it down	 we skinned it and chopped it up to prepare it for a feast once this was done	 we set out to build a village where we killed the bear and through out the day we setup our hut's and as night time came we feasted.Sleeping through the night with 2 on watch while we took turns sleeping a group of mute's tried to attack us with spears i awoke to a gun shot an our guards screaming kill them	 we came out of our hut's an surprised the attacking forces killing them all but one who we took in as a slave/experiment/pet.We then set out to the airfield where we from the mountains we called home gathered loot an supply's to last us for the ages	 when we got separated and cornered by multiple mechs	 i got trapped by my self cornered by 4 mechs i made a run for a small barracks after getting my breath back.Running in to this barracks turning around instantly to close the doors so the Z's dont swarm me only to turn back around to see whats inside this place to see 5 guys pointing their guns at me i instantly run for the door when i realize there is mechs out there they tell me everything is okay an they wont kill me and that they are friendly.When all of a sudden i recognize their commanders voice's its our fallen friends the unknown attacking group who saved ""ECHO'S""♥♥♥♥♥reincarnated in to new body's	 coming to this realization we grouped up and i headed us back to our main groups meeting point where the rest of our team was our group now 23 strong we took over the airport and setup a new home inside one of the hangers.After many days at our hanger compound collecting loot from the airfield and it's underground base we found multiple grenades rocket launchers and set out to kill one of these mechs through trial an error we worked out how to do it an started clearing the airfield of mechs word got out that we were not to be f**ked with an that the airfield was now a safe haven for all.We lived gloriously for the rest of our lives  10/10 would do it all again.GAME IS F**KING AWESOME BUY ITIt's what Day Z should of been it's what Miscreated tries to be it's what H1Z1 couldn't fathom to be it is what the War Z aka Infestation Z dreams of it's the new top dog of survival game's."
513710	1	0	DrugsAreBadMkaay	506	3	1	15.5	August 31	 201	"Let me start by saying that this should be played as a hardcore survival game and not a battle royale or deathmatch game	 and reminding you that this is an early access title that hasn't been live for a week at the time of this review. If you want a short version	 just skip to the pros and cons at the end.Now that thats out of the way	 I am enjoying almost every moment of this game. The devs have shown that they are working hard at getting this game patched and working smooth	 putting out 4 or 5 updates within the first 48 hours of the games launch. When the game initially launched	 I would get kicked out of servers every 30 minutes and now I dont know the last time I got kicked out. The servers run fairly smooth	 almost no input lag or lag between interacting with items. I personally haven't come across many players but from the ones I have come across	 about a third of them have been lagging insanely bad. The game doesnt seem to have a proper way of compensating for player lag	 they just teleport which is upsetting. So ping abusing seems to be a thing at this point.Ive seen a lot of people complaining about puppets and mechs	 so i'll go over that next. A common complaint I hear is that puppets are teleporting and they cannot hit them	 and this just doesnt happen in my time playing. The only lag I have experience with any AI is when you knock them down	 they seem to teleport back a bit when getting back up which can be frustrating when trying to get a hit in while they are down. As for mechs	 there are a few things that I agree with. As of current	 there are a few things that the mech can shoot through even though they are completely solid	 it sucks but its early access and it needs to be given time to fix. Another big thing I see people complaining about is how good they are at spotting you	 I do think they need to be tweaked a little	 but they are fairly easy to get around if you are patient and do not think that they should be removed or dumbed down too much as they are protecting most of the ""end game"" loot.Last thing i'll be going over	 preformance. Many people are saying that they cant get above 30 fps with some high end components and I dont know if this is confirmed to be an issue but there are many methods of gettings higher fps in this game as it is not completely optimized. I am currently playing the game with an RX 480 8 GB and an i7-7700k	 so I am being bottlenecked by my GPU	 and on low settings I get 60-80 fps. I believe that most people just whine that they cant get over 100 fps on an unoptomized game	 and they dont bother with fixes.Now ill just go into pros and cons:Pros+Decent graphics+Good AI+Great melee system+Substitutable crafting materials+Easy to get basic survival items+System to prevent 3rd person advantage+Unique metabolism system (might be seen as a con if youre not into hardcore survival)+Animal tracking so you don't lose your hunt if you scare it away+Fairly stable for an EA title+Puppets actually pose a threat+You can literally defacte on friends and foes+Military loot is risky not only because of players+Has singleplayer modeCons-The amount of military loot at the time seems too high-No anticheat currently which means many cheaters-Memory leak degrades preformance on long play sessions-Not easy to group with friends-Crafting UI isn't great-Currently a running sim	 vehicles are planned though-Events are almost always empty in my experience-Metabolism needs a bit of tweaking	 you will never need to eat again after hunting and cooking a single animal-Animals need to die easier with headshots using spears	 ive had dears run away with 2 spears in their head"

It really doesnt feel like early access. I'm blow away by how indepth the DEVs went into game play. Character creation along with all the stats and skills and how they affect one another is something I havent really seen before. Im shocked by how well everything runs currently too. There are some bugs to be worked out but they are being worked out extensively and quickly. I really was on the edge with this game but the more I learn the happier I am playing. I love looting and surviving and this game makes you work for it. The pace of the game is good too. Its kind of difficult to find guns and ammo unless you spend time in the military locations. The military locations offer plenty of risk as those mechs that guard the place are lethal as hell if you dont have your characters skills all in stealth. Overall this game is a blast. Im not even mad when I die with a fully geared out toon either	 it makes me want to learn from my mistakes and get better. I cant wait to see where this goes."

For a EA game it's quite stable and plays solidly.

This type of game only works well for battle royales because survival games are supposed to last	 if anything this is worse than a battle royale	 but practically the same. Sure there might be new features in the future but i doubt anything will really make this game more interesting. For some reason there seems to be a divide between survival games with bases and no bases	 when in my opinion	 if you cant keep atleast some of your items in a seperate location	 its not much of a survival game. When you want to make a game realistic	 dont just make it realistic in the ways you want it to be	 sure the food system is realistic	 the health system is realistic	 everything is realistic	 but oh wait	 you cant give yourself a home	 which is nearly essential to a literal S U R V I V A L game.

513710	1	1	Only1metal	121	10	1	2.5	September 3	 201	"Overall this game is positive but it massively needs amending / fixing. I do feel with regular updates game could easily be a 9/10 however atm it's a 7.5/10 for me.This game to put it in perspective is like PUBG & Rust having a baby together. So you land	 you've got ♥♥♥♥ all and you must search literally everywhere for supples	 food / water / weapons and a lot of materials for crafting and what's good is that you needa venture off far and search acers of land and houses. Took me almost 25 mins to find my first rifle and it had no godamn bullets so they're always seperate. It's a lot more fun when you play with friends as you can set up camp and cook food and chill and go off hunting in the wildlife and killing other players in the process and stealing their supplies & loot.The realism of the game however is definitely 10/10 as you really needa graft in order to survive	 you gotta watch for your calories	 heart monitoring and much more. I have yet to see a single zombie as apparently they don't often spawn in	 and they're only in certain locations. This game has also yet to have an anti-cheat so you may bump into 1-2 hackers but I wouldn't let that stop you from purchasing this as an Anti-Cheat is on the priority list for the next update including a lot of bug fixes. Games actually worth £15 imo it's a good price for something which does have bugs here n there. The game is fun on your own but 10x better with friends as you have an advantage when there's a group of you. This game really does test your knowledge on how to survive in an open world all a lone also with this game you do need a lot of patience and willingless to travel far distances in search of the very basic things you need to survive. To some extent it's like being in the Walking Dead ( only with less zombies ) instead you'll find most of your gameplay does consist of you trying to survive	 and a small proportion is actually PVP.So yeah overall a solid game but in need of improvements. Worth picking up and giving it a go and just keepinng up to date on the game patches."

But yes	 this game is everything you can expect it to be. It's the survival game we all never got from DayZ. The dev team is active and are all over the reddit	 showing what's up and coming and also interacting with players and listen to feedback. Gameplay wise	 this game is spectacular. It looks beautiful on ANY graphics preset and runs well at recommended specs. This is a game you can really get immersed in."

Buildings not rendering in	 while the players do	 from a distance. this lead me to believe I had wiped a squad of 5 in a field	 as I walked closer	 the buildings loaded in and they were all hiding in the prison	 but on my screen they were standing in a field and able to be shot. Also	 the third person awareness mechanic is currently broken	 the player will not be seen while 3p peaking	 but the weapons on his back will render	 appearing to look like floating weapons moving around.there are plently of things that aren't spelt correct	 and that could be annoying. this is not an excuse for being early access	 you had time to add them extra letters and do some research	 this is laziness. also	 most of the descriptions for items in-game are a DIRECT copy and paste from Wiki-pedia.they take pride in the metabolism feature but it is NOT realistic whatsoever. certain food that would fufill requirements in real life	 do NOT in-game. and I know there isn't an excuse for this because those food items will support your metabolism	 just providing the incorrect minerals. they had time to give these items some kind of result	 just incorrect.The desync makes PVP literally unplayable. I have never seen desync this bad. all this being said	 it's still somehow better than most games I have played on Steam	 leading me to believe this game has a GREAT structure and I'[m super interested to see where it goes."

Definitly recommended this is the 1st game that feels fun to play just coming out of EA its refreshing for a person like me who really only plays ea's besides rust becuase that just came out of ea but i played it through ea	 If you dont have a lot of time on your hands to play	 you can just hop on scum visit a town then get off	 eventually you will find a gun	 then find a person	 theyn kill the person	 then get the loot. Its as simple as that if you dont hvae time to dedicated to videogames but you still like the hardcore experience the scum provides	 yes there are aspects that are hard to get a grip on like awareness(which is an amazing feature you just forget that its a thing sometimes) i really love this game at its super early stage	 i wish the devs well and i wish them a good outcome for this game"

513710	1	0	retscene	148	2	1	16.4	September 4	 201	"FYI: This game is Early Access.Pros:-Graphics: The lighting and scenery both look very good.  Definitely	 top-tier for survival games.-Crafting: The system is extremely detailed and quite simple to follow.  The recipes actually make sense + you can switch crafting parts for others sensibly.-Food/Health: The metabolism system is easy to follow (although	 nearly overdetailed).  The numbers are all easy to follow	 once you get your bearings from playing for a bit	 though you do not need to know what everything means to play (I definitely don't)-Difficulty: The game has a slight learning curve	 but if you've played survival games before it's definitely easy to pick up.  However	 while it is a survival game I see it sharing a lot more similarities with Escape From Tarkov than Rust.-Combat: Hand-to-hand combat makes sense and punches feel like they land when they should/same with dodging.Gunplay seems okay so far	 but I have not had a lot of time fighting other players.-Finetuning: When playing it's hard to ignore the amount of thought that has gone into each system	 the weapon loading makes sense	 the crafting makes sense.-Most mushrooms are nutritious and tasty.Cons:-Optimization: I've heard that the optimization is not great.  (I have an ""enthusiast"" PC; it's hard for me to offer an opinion)         This is definitely a 2018 designed game	 so do not run it on your desktop from 2011.-Not a lot to do if you find yourself alone & wandering through the forest.. This is an Early Access title	 and there will obviously be more planned.-I ate a poisonous mushroom once and forced my character to vomit."

Now let me explain the cons and then the pros of the game.Cons:The complicated metabolism system. You have to constanly check your characters vitamins	 minerals	 fat	 protien	 and water. You have to also watch the calorie intake vs usage. (The first con I don't have a problem with but many of the people I know do.)The second con is mechs. If you want to get military gear you have to enter a place with giant robots guarding them. You can get around them	 but they can take you down in one shot. Even with a combat style helmet and balistic vest. Although it take two or three shots to take you down.The third con is military bases and similar places. A player can enter a compound or bunker and stay there	 looting the place and logging off. After five to ten minutes they can log back on and they spawn back inside the bunker	 and loot again. Unlimited times	 so if you do make it inside of the bunker alive there is a chance there will be nothing left. (But there are so many different military bunkers that the chances are extremly small)The rest of the cons would be the game is not finished	 not everything is implemented in the game yet. (some bunkers have doors that can't be opened and some buildings cant be accesed)End of Cons (Besides general bugs that you find in every early access game)Pros:The game has some of the best graphics I've seen. The lighting	 rain	 thunder and the scenes you find in the game are amazing (In Ultra).(Firearm Combat) The gun system is perfect. The balistics in guns work to the point of extreme realism. Angles of impact	 caliber of bullet	 and range all impact how effective firearms are. For example I was able to kill a man with a .22 caliber rifle. He was wearing a balistic vest and a helmet	 but I shot him between the eyes. If i shot him in the helmet or the chest	 he would've gunned me down. The placement of shots really do impact the combat system.(Melee Combat and Throwing) Although I don't have to much melee combat experience	 I can say It works. To win a fist fight you gotta have alot of muscle or you're fighting someone brand new to the game.  With weapons	 I've always chosen the knife over a sledgehammer	 axe or baseball bat. The reason is throwing. You can throw all weapons (besides guns)	 and most items. The knife for some reason has been very generous to me. A headshot with a knife or spear is an instakill on any puppet (zombie) or player.(Character Creation) When loading into a server or a single player game you have a vast amount of options on who your character will be. There are four main attributes. Stength	 Dexterity	 Constition	 and Inteligence. A youtube video can explain it better than me so I'll save you some time.Is the game worth buying?The game is a work in progress	 and it has flaws. I believe that the game has 20$ worth of gameplay	 and there is more coming. But before buying the game do some more reseacrch	 watch some gameplay videos and figure for yourself if its worth buying.So far the game for myself is a 8/10. It's better than Dayz and cheaper to."

513710	0	0	aqanamajes	40	1	1	31.9	September 4	 201	"The Good: For an early access it seems pretty solid. There are the occasional network issues	 but not nearly as bad as I expected. For all the negative reviews complaining about lack of loot	 I thought I would have trouble finding/crafting anything	 but I have had no shortage of loot and not all of it has been common/junk type items. All I can say for those who struggle to find loot is explore	 and use your first character or two to learn to fight zombies with a shovel/axe/baseball bat/etc. There is rhythm to it and it will make accessing towns simpler when you are trying to evade zombies. Also if you learn to pull them you shouldn't get more than one or two at a time. The level of thought into every action is fairly well done	 some issues/improvements needed but again early access it is to be expected.The ""Bad"": Some of this just might be my lack of experience with the game	 others are areas I'm sure will improve as the game continues developing	 but there are also a few things that to me seem to contradict the intent of realism. Bathroom use. My character will tell me when he needs to urinate	 but never tells me when he needs to void. Instead he will drop trou on his own with no warning	 nevermind I just walked into a field of zombies or was in the middle of eating/crafting	 etc. Unsure if the prisoner will also urinate on his own as I have always done so when the warning comes up. A more realistic course of events would be to warn the player	 then to wet/soil himself at say 105%. You could ""dirty"" clothes and increase weight from wetness. Just saying	 if a zombie caught me when I was on the way to the lou I wouldn't stop to do my business first... Clipping issues: cutting down trees near other trees/bushes often leaves floating logs. Not game breaking	 just less immersive. Inability to move/controll placement of crates and shelters. Sure you can control the general area and to some extent the direction by where you craft and the direction you face	 but no ability to really control placement. I can't wedge that crate inbetween a couple rocks to hide it from others	 instead I might finding it sitting on top of the rock in plain view for all passersby. Limited crafting	 I only mention this to mention it; I'm sure much more is to come as more skills are implemented and more is patched down the road. However	 it is annoying to find only 9mm guns and shotguns and my 9mm ammo is permanently greyed out in the crafting legend/table and I'm unable to craft shotgun shells at all (not even listed in the crafting legend let alone greyed out). Or maybe this is in the game and my character hasn't progressed enough to access it? No ability to place markers on my map. Sure I can screenshot my map and save the image and create markers on it that way	 and leave it pulled up on my 2nd moniter. But given that we can clearly work around this	 why not just implement it in game? Let me mark where my hidden caches are; even from a realism approach very few maps are void of symbols or markers. Require us to have a pen in hand if you have to	 but let us mark our maps. Another area for improvement	 crafted items drop to the ground rather than put in inventory when I have room for them. Can't count the number of ropes I've left behind because I forgot they drop to the ground instead. Last area with room for improvement	 I can select multiple items but can only pick them up with individual command. If I have 10 horse meat (honestly it was more like 200 but I could only carry 10 at a time). I know I can just double click and rapidly pick them up	 but dragging them one at a time from my inventory to their container isn't the height of entertainment. Let me ""select all"" and drag all of them out of my inventory and into the container. If you have to just put a timer on it for completion just like any other task.The (B)Ugly: Just a few things I've noticed that I beleive are bugs. When crafting ammuntion with a small toolbox	 it won't allow me to use a small toolbox once it only has 1 charge left. I didn't notice how many charges were being depleted each time I used it	 but the crafting legend shows ""Small toolbox x1."" I had ample metal	 lead	 and gunpowder. I also had placed an AGOG on a rifle (can't recall which one	 my first character and I died shortly after)	 I had then found a hunting scope and wanted to swap it out. I would attempt to drag the AGOG off onto the ground	 but the result would be an AGOG icon still attached to the rail/gun and one on the ground. The one on the ground couldn't be moved except back onto the AGOG icon still attached to the weapon. However in doing so the AGOG then disappeared visually from the gun and the right mouse then brought up the ironsights. A quick exit/renter returned the AGOG to the weapon and allowed its use	 but I still couldn't remove it. Also noticed zombies can attack through solid doors. Maybe this is intended	 but seemed to be more of a clipping issue. I was standing on the other side of the door getting ready to open it and attack. I'm guessing part of me stuck through the other side or something. Again nothing game breaking just had to stand half a step further back.Overall	 very impressive given its early access. Plenty of playability in its current state and definitely looking forward to seeing how this one grows/improves with time."

Gamespires is doing a great job of pushing out alo of mini updates that fix issues that are plagueing some forums. outside of the occasional memory crash	 i dont have many complaints overall	 and certainly not any game breaking ones.im not gonna explain the metabolism	 pooping	 or any of the already well known functions in the game. one thing that makes this more than just a run	 loot	 eat	 shoot is the micromanaging features of your metabolism. really gives you so options and gets you involved in your eating choices and health.the other features are the mechs	 they totally change how you play	 as killing them is not a viable option	 you must sneak around them when they turn there backs. and they are very attentive	 they will see you thru windows and start shooting	 thru open doors	 etc. whiel they dont pursue you	 they do maintain a lock on you until you stop moving and are hidden or are dead. i will be playing this game and ejoying it for a long	 long time."

Please note that most of my complaints are due to my own hardware (Ryzen 1700 @3.7	 1x8GB ddr4 2666	 RX 480) Cons-Game runs like crap for me	 on the lowest settings and 50% render scale I get 25-50 fps at any given time. -As I'm sure most of you know the desync is god awful but the game is 4 days old	 I expect this to be fixed down the line.-While food is easy to get by finding farms	 there is no point.

I don't know what causes you having   to emegency poop but it always happens when I'm three feet in front of a mech and they can't hit me when I am pooping   idk why.-Current level of character customization is low but I imagine will be increased with further patches.Pros-The game runs at the same fps give or take 10 frames across all graphics presets.-Puppets seem to be very well rounded and populate areas sufficiently.-Loot is very accurate to what I imagine a real situation similar to this would be like. (You don't find OP military gear in a   farm house type of thing.)Very new game but I absolutely recomend it to anyone who likes games like DayZ or Miscreated	 or just want's a very challenging and fun survival game to play."

You can amuse yourself for hours with just finding and building♥♥♥♥♥♥ all the while keeping a serious in-depth eye on your health.I've only played multiplayer yet	 though it feels as a singleplayer 'cause of the map's size and no friends to play with.Pros:-Servers are a-plenty and work well-The physics and inertia are just right	 moving around feels smooth and natural. Realistic leg-breaking when jump-running off of cliff (don't do that)-Super intense metabolism system makes you realize that self-care is of the utmost importance (which it is; projectile pooping isn't as fun as it sounds). -Zombies are too dumb to open a door but intelligent enough to find a back door to the place you're hiding. Smacking them in the head with various items is quite satisfying. Bonus for the post-zombiemeat BBQ-fest-Interesting revive system	 makes you want to get out there and do stuff for merit points-Server keeps all your♥♥♥♥♥♥right where you left it; up until the last chopped up swine (unless you stray too far and then log off)-Not really relevant but still worth mentioning: Runs a very doable 50 fps on low-medium settings on my old '12 rig (OCed GTX680	 i5-3570k	 24gb mem)Don't let your old gear hold you back from trying this one out Cons:-Huge map - no vehicles (yet)-""Events"" not really playable yet (huge map few players)-Annoyances in UI (item handling and storage).Automatically dropping item you're holding when you take a sip of soda from your bag	 next having to select the sodacan	 drag the sodacan from hands back to storage and then having to search for said dropped previous item in the tall grass is overly realistic and melts my brain-Storage is a big mess	 no ordening system	 keep accidentally selecting stuff-No way of interacting with other players yet besides speech-Combat is not yet very fun; *if*you're lucky enough to encounter anyone	 killing is either too easy or it's ""o hai im hack0rz ur ded""-MOAR animals please!

Already the game that DayZ was meant to be in every way even in day 3 beta at a reasonable price. Though it doesn't feel as ""big"" as the DayZ map it feels fuller. Can't wait to see what else the devs will add to this game.One concern is not to emphasize on fort building	 that IMO was a flaw on a game like H1Z1 where it was pretty much abandoned after PUBG came out."

The game is out on early access and literally comes with a disclaimer saying expect problems. Ive sunk 3 hours into the game and love it. Its like DayZ on steroids except the engine actually works... The game runs very smooth and I have a fairly old pc (Radeon R290X). as for the server instability issues	 in the 3 hours of game time I have only ever had 1 DC...It does take a while to find a gun and ammo and a mag that work together	 but right from the beggining you are able to get the materials to craft throwing spears which can one hit zombies.For the price this game is being sold... its very very much worth it!"

My only gripe with this game is that there is no mobility at the moment (cars etc) but seeing how you can put points into driving	 piloting and boating	 it will get added.. There are times it does feel like a heavy run simulator but I'm sure that will change once vehicles are added	 or if they reduce the cost of fame to respawn.. You can infact select spawn locations (squad	 shelter	 same sector	 etc etc) but it does eat through your fame points quite a bit.. Great game! Friends and I are enjoying it greatly!"

A Co-op private server option would improve that so you don't have to rent a server just to play just with your friends.So this review is for the singelplayer part of the game cause I really don't care about the multiplayer version yet.The game has big potentials	 but for now it is not for me as the singelplayer mode is hard as hell and you will die and have to start all over again. That for me is a game killer.1. There are no difficulty settings for singleplayer. And the only default setting is kind or set to ""ScewYouMode"". 2. This is a mix between Escape From Tarkow and DayZ.3. There is no way to save the game progress in the game except for when you exit the game.4. The zombies lock on to you within a certain distance and there is no escape	 except to face the certain death or just kill yourself. They can even see where you are heading when you are in a house so you can't run out the back door to escape them. Even if you are in a building they lock on to you without seeing you at all. So this must improve a lot.5. The fighting skill is just bad for now	 and stay away from the goat	 it will kill you in one hit if you just wound it. haha6. Today they removed the F10 spectator mode	 cause of the glitch there I was able to survive for a while and that made the game fun. 7. The robots can see true walls and will kill you	 in certain places at the airfield and the rest of the map.8. Singelplayer mode should have an option to save multiple saves in case you die	 or have the option to make a save point at house or shelter cause the zombies are OP af right now. If you fight one you will need to find bandage to heal and if you fight 2 you will die. Easy	 Normal and Hard (screw you) difficulty would be nice to.9. The buildings and the inside of them are the same all over the map	 it's like Ghost Recon Wild lands. So that's just boring.10. There is way to little weapons in the game that you can find and use to be ready to fight.For now the game  is a big NO for me	 but we will see how it's going to develop in the future.But if you like to DIE and start all OVER and OVER and OVER again from scratch	 this is the game for you and you should buy it.I will update the review if the singelplayer version of the game do some huge changes.The multiplayer version of it is like Escape From Tarkov but with more survival	 if you like that you will love this game."

I know i only have 59 mins in this game but 40 of those 59 mins was  me trying to connect to a server  with my friends so unless you have a god tier computer I suggest waiting a few months for the devs to improve the opdimize the game  before you spend your money on it

However having spent nearly an hour trying to get started due to a lack of walkthrough tutorials on how the basics work and the constant glitches and crashes I had enough. Only to be told by steam I could not claim a refund as I had gone over the 2 Hours gameplay they deem is sufficient to be able to see if its a game you like. It is a game I would probably enjoy but it has way to many glitches and should be pulled by either steam or the developer until they have it sorted! Very disappointed in both companies with the lack of support.

But they have fixed the server stability very well so far. Its been a lot better since launch and i do reccomend it.  They have been releasing a lot of updates to fix many issues.  I still hate how overpowered the mechs are but i hope that will change in time. But for now i highly reccomend if you enjoy a more hardcore survival game with more than just looting and then killing!

Solo he jugado como 70 minutos porque me parece un coñazo spawnear en medio de un bosque y tener que correr (literalmente) 5 o 10 minutos hasta las casas más cercanas y saber que es imposible recorrerse todo el mapa. Cuando añadan vehículos a lo mejor lo vuelvo a jugar	 mientras tanto	 jugaré al backgammon."

The graphics are suberb but more importantly the mechanics of the game are very good now and show promise for a whole new level of survival game there are some issues such as disconnects but those seem to be minimal for me at least and I had a issue with the anti cheat not letting me launch the game once but a simple verify of the files fixed that. Besides that the enemy's are so far ok the mechs are a nice change of pace for a game were evasion is your best option instead of just killing everything. Besides that if you enjoy a good survival game that is pretty unforgiving to say the least than you should buy it while its at a low price. Keep in mind though that this game is still in development and will probaly have many ups and downs before its released.

So this is probably the least biased review you'll see on here.First off	 this game is AMAZING. Before anyone complains about high end PCs crashing/frame rate dropping	 OFF COURSE this is going to happen. It's in Alpha and they're actively delivering patches as it goes. This is expected	 so be patient. I have a NVIDIA 1050 and run on all high settings and dont stutter/drop frames unless i go into a big city or logged on for a lengthy period of time. Due to the patches i've already lost two multiplayer characters (had about 10 hours of gameplay on both) and I'm not even upset	 because i know this game will only get better.In regards to the gameplay- I'm in love with how in depth the survivial is in the game. It literally breaks down the amount of sodium and vitamins you intake	 which too high sodium intake= dehydration/too much food in your stomach= vomiting. The atmosphere	 various amounts of loot and crafting you can forge	 and need to survive compliment each other efficiently. The combat currently is a little buggy	 both melee and using a rifle	 but again it's ex[pected. for $20 this is honestly a steal and is even more fun with friends. Overall	 just from how the devs have been working day and night to deliver 3 patches in less than two weeks	 and how the game has already progressed so far	 i give it a 8.5/10 with the only cons being lag/lack of conent. Once this game has finally reached its end state I will undoubtedly drop a solid 10/10."

There is a lot to loot and from what I saw	 the loot is quite well balanced. But the only real goal and progression is to get better loot and weapons so that you can survive going into the POI's to get... better loot?Basically the game is about looting so that you can loot better items to loot better items and maybe kill a player to get loot every now and then. Maybe worth $20 now	 but I wouldn't recommend as yet."

Still	 it's in EA	 it has it's faults like:-Optimiztion problems-Bugs-Character creator is not that good (for now)-Walking( A LOT)But they are going to add so many things and it's pretty good in it's current state!The survival game I had the most fun with and the most realistic game that I've played!"
513710	0	0	blackwinter121	168	23	1	32.6	September 7	 201	"This game has a lot of potential...At the moment	 there isn't much to the game - which is to be expected at such an early point in its development. In its current state	 you build a character by aportioning skill points into Strength	 Dexterity	 Constitution and Inteligence. You are then released into the (HUGE) map without any inication of what you should be doing or how to play... which initially is part of the beauty! You find yourself begin to loot buildings	 bodies and military installments while avoiding zombies	 hostile players and the ocasional mech / sentry. All the while you are monitoring your characters metabolism and injury levels. PVP is (from what I have experienced) sparse and few and far between. Also	 (at present) there isn't much in the way of crafting or base building.... but this is all to come!At the moment... that is all.However...This game has huge potential. I would say if I were to list all of the games together that remind me of this	 it would consist of DayZ	 Escape from Tarkov	 Rust and PubG. If the game were to be implemented with certain characteristics from all of these games it would make for one hell of a game!The developers for this game seem to have a lot of love for this game. So far from what I have heard (from before I bought the game)	 it has been updated fairly regularly and all bugs that have been reported are receiving attention. They also seem to have a great sense of humor - both implemented in the game as well as through the Development Blogs they post online.So yes... at the moment there isn't an awful lot to it. Yes	 the PVP isn't great. Yes	 there are some bugs. Yes	 it is heavily loot driven. Yes	 crafting is lacking. But I think it is a great start for a game that can only get better with enough attention to it.I certainly look forward to seeing what they make of this one!"

Coming off of average and sub par survival games this is up there with The Forest for me. I hear people complaining of crashes so far I have none to speak of.Playing on a 1070ti with 16gb of DDR4 and an i7 7700k I've not real issues. Framerate is stable at 90fps on max settings with the occasional stutter when a big city loads.I will say if you go play on an online server there are some hitches in connetion. A LOT of the servers are in the EU so my ping is around 100 playing from the US. Sucks that renting a servering will cost me 20 bucks a month for my community so I'm going to wait for that to come down a bit. The developers seem very committed to this game and community and I'm going to continue playing this until I've explored all of the map and dominate a sever with my friends. Looking forward to what is coming in the future! 100 PERCENT WORTH THE 20$ (I paid 29.99 so I could♥♥♥♥♥♥out items from the ol' prison wallet)

This game allows you to pick where you spawn	 provided you have the fame points to do it.  Beautiful graphics	 realistic gameplay.   As long as they keep the updates and content coming	 this game will do fantastic.

We joined a server and started making our shelter in the woods. We finished crafting our 3rd storage chest and hear a loud roar just a few meters away!! A big♥♥♥♥♥grizzly comes charging at Koal!! I try to buck a few rounds off with the ol' pump action! I aimed down sight and missed!! The bear is just too fast! Koal gets mauled with a big right paw and folds like grandma's lawn chair on the front porch. I try to shoot the bear again but he is just a bobbin an a weavin! Koal comes to and tries to retreat  but the bear is on his♥♥♥♥♥like some brothas at the KFC buffet. Again he gets batted with a right paw and buckles like a suitcase. His head looks like a bowl of plums. I can't believe Koal is still alive!! But he pulls himself together playing tag around a couple big cedar trees. The bear isn't taking any of his Sh!t and charges!! Koal gets knocked down again and the bear is on top of him about to finish him off!! Koal whips out his big iron and scores a crit!!! The bear lets out a massive groan and rolls off my Friendly Canadian buddy. I can't believe he killed the bear and lived to tell the tale!! I chopped off the bears head and made a hat out of it.TL/DR     11/10 would watch my buddy Koal get taken out Revenant style again!!

Literally no method of transportation aside from running	 which will literally take you about an hour to run two grids (the map is huge).  Hardly any content at this point.  Has potential in the future	 but unless your purely buying to support the devs there is literally no enjoyment in this game currently."

The mechanics are very in depth	 and the loot is really well balanced and distributed through the map. The environment is nice and very interactive. The hunting and crafting mechanics are really nice	 but a bit confusing at the start. If you're not a big fan of games like DayZ or Miscreated	 it probably isn't for you. This game has a ton of potential if you can see past the immediate issues with a fresh launch. For $19.99	 I'd say it's worth a buy	 if you are worried about optimization and bugs	 maybe wait a few days and see how they're handled."

I can't even imagine what these dev's have planned for the future and I would highly recommend getting this game as soon as you can because it's only $19.99 and over time will increase in price based on the content it releases and the more content there is to play.I would get it now at it's cheapest price. But if it came down to it I would have paid $59.99...Good job dev's!"

It is fun and immersive	 graphics are also very good.Melee mechanics are wonky and don't make sense like most games that have ""zombies"" (I know they are called puppets in game) the fact you just swing a spear or a pitch for like a baseball is very unnatural when you could just hit something in the head	 doesn't make much sense.The current meta is to go to military bases and loot while trying not to get shot by hyper noise sensitive AI Mechs. This is a very boring concept right off the bat IMO. This might change as we get farther out of early access	 and I hope it does.Having to hold W and run through the woods for 20-30 minutes just to get to a town and loot around the very predictive mechs can't be a long lasting concept.If you don't mind dealing with early access and not knowing what direction the game is going	 but are a fan of the genre	 it is worth the money for now. If you are looking a fully functioning game and would rather wait for the official release you will be paying more money down the road.

This game needs mad optimization	 and an easier way to group up with friends instead of having to meet them and grouping up there. That is really annoying.     I was really not impressed with this game because of the FPS drops from forest to towns. small towns are no problem but big towns like timsy or tisy (whatever the name is	 its on the southside of the map by the coast). My fps sunk really badly. I love the concept of the game	 but as of currently I am giving this game a Negative on its review. Its still far too unplayable."

I love how the attributes play well with things like hunting hearing gunshots and fights with players and A.I. The game is all about knowledge inventory managment and arguably the most important	 patience. What I mean by patience is how when you are near a MECH you dont sprint in front of it thinking ""oh it's too far away"". Or maybe intead of running to get close to an enemy which could be wearing camouflage equipment and maxed out stealth skill and comouflage skill. If you are sprinting through a field rather than being sneaky you might get caught by surprise. Anyways my point being THIS GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS	 HAS SOME BUGS AND IS IN NEED OF OPTOMIZATION IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT IT HAS TONS OF POTENTIAL TO BE SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SURVIVAL GAME. AT THE MOMENT IT IS VERY FUN DEFINITELY WORTH THE BUY. BEST $20 GAME ON STEAM!"

That being said	 they really need to show the SP mode of the game some love.  I see also that it has an online co-op mode	 and if I can talk my buddies into buying it	 I will definitely give it a go as well.I'm really enjoying the game so far	 except for the random crashes and lockups that cause me to engage the three-finger-escape in order to exit the game.

So far I have to say	 great job!For an Early Access title this already feels better than DayZ and the myriad other survival games I've played. The first hour I was second guessing my decision to buy. I was thinking ""oh great	 another running simulator"". Once I got to my first small town and really took the time to learn the game mechanics	 I was hooked.I have read some people are experiencing techincal issues	 which is a given for an early release title. I will say I have been pretty lucky in this regard. Other than some minor stuttering	 now and then	 the game is running very well.One mechanic I have heard some people don't like is the scroll wheel for running. I have to disagree. The scroll wheel makes movement feel much more fluid and precise. I especially like using it to transition from outdoors to indoors.I am really looking forward to seeing the game develop	 I think they could have a big winner here. I can't wait for fortifications to become available.To anyone frustrated starting out	 starving	 dying	 etc; try to have some patience. Take some time to understand the mechanics and you will likely start to enjoy it quite a bit.If you are looking for just another Battle Royale type game	 this is not it.

Cannot wait to play more and see how the game grows. At the price of $22.79 CDN	 SCUM is an absolute steal and should not be passed up if you even have an ounce of interest in survival games like Day Z	 SCUM etc. I did not expect to be as interested and as invested as I have been since the game hit EA.Edit: the amount of support this game has gotten since release has been amazing. Four patches	 plus the inclusion of anti-cheat within one week of release. This is a dev team that listens closely to their community	 and acts swiftly on their changes/updates.Greatest.

I have high expectations and definitely think SCUM will live up to them.HOWEVER	 the reason I won't recommend it is due to current state	 It is nowhere near being a bad game by any means.First of all the audio is pretty busted	 make sure you don't have more than one headset plugged in since the game doesn't have an audio output selector and seems to output to the first device it finds. Took me a few minutes to figure out it was outputting audio to my Rift rather than the Windows Default output device.Secondly	 and most importantly	 performance. In short: It runs like dog turd. I have turned all settings to minimum at 50% render resolution and its still difficult to break 40fps with my GTX 1080. After a few minutes this drops to 15fps.I will gladly change my review to recommended once the performance issues are fixed.I really want to play more but can't with this performance.I recommend waiting a week or two and hopefully they'll fix these issues."

Currently people seem to be complaining about the servers lagging too	 but it's nothing that destroys the gameplay.I hope that the customization gets more advanced over time	 and vehicles get added which seems a must as walking for hours ain't always funny	 a little mixture would be great.

THere doesn't seem to be nearly enough suplly to find in the world to craft weapons and survive. The only thing I found to eat where shrooms and they made me puke. I had zombies alert to me while crouched inside of a house... that needs to be worked on for a game with stealth mechanics. I didn't think I would like the movement speed with the scroll wheel	 but it turned out to be fine	 although it may be better if sprinting was still on shift with the shift-scroll to adjust speeds as needed. The only weapon I was able to find in over an hour was a spade. I couldn't even find a tree limb to use as a club or for crafting. Overall I have to say I like the inovative features in this and I hope they use EA to continue to polish and work on this."

The one thing that makes this game better than most other in its genre	 is the developer (Gampires). They truly want this to be a game changing game for this genre. They know what they like and what they don't like and will actually listen to the community when the situation arises. Gamepires is one of the best Developers I have come across in my 32 years of gaming. (I know I'm old	 f*** off! Lol) The game in its current state has bugs here and there	 because it's still in development (that's what Early Access means	 for those that don't know)	 but I wouldn't call any of them game-breakers. The online part of the game is having issues	 but the devlopers know about it and are working overtime to fix it. The single player part is great and have only had the game crash a couple of times for me so far. If you like this genre	 then it is definitely worth the cheap price this early in the development	 you won't regret it!!!"

Early Access has it's flaws	 but so do a lot of AAA games now a days. I mean does anyone remeber when Battlefield 4 launched? Or The Division? How about For Honor? With that said this is a new early access release of an open world survival game. It takes some stuff from DayZ	 some stuff from Escape From Tarkov	 and adds in some of it's own unique flavor to the game.I like it. It's like Bear Grilles the game. The miromanagement of your character body is a bit overwhelming at first but you soon get in the groove of the mechanics of how to make sure your guy is eating enough and not too much. The map is huge	 leading to several places to explore. Crafting is sometimes spotty given that it will sometimes not let you craft even though you have all the items (after some research it seems that you have to have full duribility on said items in order to use them to craft) but that's only certain things. No tutorial which blows because you have to spend a lot of time and die several times in order to figure out what the hell your doing. Towns are scattered around the map for you to loot for decent gear. But of course the good♥♥♥♥♥♥is in the big bases crawling with Mechs. Yes Mechs. AI piloted mechs that sometimes yell at you to leave and other times decide to shoot the air above you and every so often one shot the hell out of your face from 100 meters. There goes all that damn loot	 but at least I know what not to do in that base. Knowlegde achieved. Lots of good in the game and the visuals are really well done. Huge memory leak issue which makes for 97% of my usage being this game alone.Some stuttering here and there	 even in single player. High populated servers make it worse at times. And if you and your mates decide to fight even one other real person	 get ready for the crazy every single person teleports around while you all try to hit each other with a baseball bat. Can lead to some funny moments where you hit your friends instead of the other guy	 or property damage as you teleport 5 feet to the side of the building you were facing and hit the door twice.You have to manage your poop and pee too. Make sure you do or you might find yourself having explosive	 projectile diharrea in the middle of a fight with a pack of zombies. Yeah there is zombies too. All in all I would recommend game. Once you get into the swing of it it really opens up and gets easier.In conclusion	 Mechs	 Zombies	 and poop. 10/10 would wipe my own♥♥♥♥♥and smell it again."

Oh	 and pretty much every server has at least a 1-2 hackers	 some have more. So... Yeah	 bear that in mind I guess... You can effectively have ""end-game"" loot (like an AKM/AKS-74u	 an SVD	 or a Kar98. a bulletproof vest and camo gear with a good backpack) within 10-20min of spawning if you're lucky enough. Otherwise it might take you around 1hr	 maybe 2 if you're really unlucky. Either way	 it's quick and easy. Probably too quick and too easy	 but meh. At that stage	 the only thing that's really left to do is PvP... So it effectively becomes a cycle of go to the airstrip	 get gear	 pvp	 die	 repeat. If you're into that kind of monotonous gameplay	 you'll probably enjoy Scum in its current state. I suppose you could also do the whole survival end of things. But	 it feels like some of the systems for that might not be working right	 or something. At one point	 my character had injested over 25	000 kcal over 10 in-game hours... Pretty crazy to say the least. Beyond that	 it's impossible to keep your sugar levels up	 literally impossible. You'll have 100% one minute	 then 0% 25 seconds later. Hunting can be fun	 when animals aren't desyncing across the map	 or disappearing altogether......Might as well just PvP...That all said	 it's still a pretty good game.

(Only problems are lowish fps unless you adjust your nvidia settings and also some server stability issues depending on the amount of players on the server) Besides that I highly recommend! 8/10"

513710	1	1	76561198030372322	345	1	-1	12.3	September 9	 201	"This is one of those I really wish Steam had a maybe button moments. I only have a few hours in the game and I am going to continue playing it as I enjoy playing with the friends who also have the game. However	 in its current state there are a few issues that really turn me off from the game and I feel like I'm forcing myself to continue playing. The first and most glaring issue is when you die. In most survival-based games where you die and lose everything your hunger and thirst meters are reset	 this is not the case in Scum. Although you get a full health bar your hydration and energy meters are not reset meaning you're still going to suffer starvation and dehydration effects. While the worst I've experienced from this mechanic is my health pool very slowly ticking down the game does not do a great job of explaining if this is going to have other negative effects on my character. This wouldn't be so terribly annoying if it did not cost Fame (The games in game currency) to spawn again. Which I'm guessing was the devs way of mitigating players simply killing themselves to respawn with full meters. But my former point of this not happening anyway makes the whole system seem pointless. My next issue is the melee combat. While I only gave myself a basic level in boxing I did make it a point to bring melee weapons to medium	 (the available levels being none	 basic	 medium	 and advanced) I assumed this would serve me decently against the ""puppets"" or zombies of the game. Boy was I wrong	 even at the start of the game after making myself a makeshift spear and attacking my first zombie my character was sluggish with the execution of some attacks taking so long the enemy was able to close the distance and stagger me out of the animation before I could hit them. In the open this wasn't so bad because you could kite them and throw your weapon killing them eventually. However	 I had a moment where I experienced a rather large lag spike which I assumed was the server spawning an enemy because once it resolved a zombie teleported in front of me cornered me in a room and took me from 100 to 0 health as I tried in vain to swing the axe I had found at him constantly being hit out of the animation. Frustrated I spawned again and began searching for the friend I was playing with leading me to an airfield where he was hiding which brings me to my next negative point. THE GIANT UNKILLABLE ROBOTS. I get their point I do it's to protect key areas of the game so that players can't rush the best areas and get the military level gear there however the robots feel like a cheap mechanic that artificially ramps up the difficulty because the AI is unpredictable. Upon arriving their I had found a decent amount of gear and a shotgun which is in part why I was so upset because these robots will instant kill you if they detect you which is fine it's their job after all. The reason I was mad however was because I was not inside the base but outside the fenced area trying to get an idea on the situation and one of the robots inside the base off-screen domed me. I have advanced level stealth by the by and I was hiding in bushes	 but I digress. I would have assumed the robots simply ignored these stats if not for my friend who informed me the AI is rather random he's sometimes able to get right under their feet without them noticing and other times they spot you miles away and kill you. I personally would be happier if they simply ramped up the zombie presence in these important areas instead of utilizing these robots. Although these zombies can be a nuisance at least you feel as if you can do something about them including simply sneak around them provided you haven't alerted them with a gun shot. Despite all these issues I have had genuine fun with this game as a fan of the Arma Day-Z mod which if you go into this game having played it in its heyday knowing all the bugs that came with it you'll most likely be pretty forgiving when it comes to some of the issues with this game. However	 I cannot personally recommend this game to anyone other than hardcore Day-Z players which is why I'd have to give this game an overall no even though I fully intend to keep playing and supporting the game as I've been looking forward to it for sometime. I would feel disingenuous giving this game a yes despite all the issues I've had with it and the sometimes-frustrating mechanics. However	 that does not mean everyone should stay away as I said Day-Z fans will have a blast with this game as it feels like a much more polished version of that but your average gamer most likely is going to be turned off by the game in its current stateTLDR:I have fun with this game despite its many flaws including	 a stat system that I feel isn't descriptive enough	 not regaining energy and hydration on death despite paying for respawn with in game points	 being constantly hit out of attack animations by zombies despite having a decent level of melee combat	 and instant kill robots. Day-Z fans will love the game. People not experienced with this kind of game might want to wait for a sale or the game to receive a few more updates before purchasing which is why I have to give the game an overall no."

So	 if you're interested in running around the map for 600 years only to stumble across a farmhouse with an empty .22 rifle (JUST LIKE IN DAYZ) then you'll really enjoy this game. Im sorry	 I really wanted to like SCUM. I had my eye on it for many months. I expected it to be a more action-packed	 tension filled DayZ	 not a duplicate clone with some better optimization and UI. after even just a measly hour	 I should have accomplished more than aimlessly running around a mostly barren map toting an empty .22 rifle that probably does absolutely no damage. Its JUST LIKE DAYZ in that regard. you wont find jack♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you go to a base or an airstrip. (places where high level loot players reside	 leaving you vulnerable to immediate death upon arriving to these few popular locations.) Trust me	 I get it. They cant throw weapons all over the place. Its a survival game. but seriously	 dont be ♥♥♥♥ing jews about the loot either. We should have better access to handguns and small caliber ammunition. Im not asking to drop AR's and snipers all over the place	 just give the players SOMETHING to give them a chance against stacked players who alrerady visit the main loot locations. This game would be so much more fun if it was based around constant action and tension. and unfortunately it lacks both of those qualities	 leading me to think of it as nothing more than a DayZ ripoff. Oh	 and if you hop on too late in the day	 good luck finding loot. servers hardly reset. (JUST like DayZ)Bottom line: the game is NOT friendly to people who enjoy consistant action and progression. It was made for the niche of players who still give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about hardcore survival games after the failure of DayZ. I'll never understand why and how people can dump hundreds to thousands of hours doing the SAME♥♥♥♥♥♥all day. Theres NOTHING to do in this game. Spawn	 loot a robot base for good loot or get sniped on the way	 kill others	 repeat. its ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic. I already wasted money on DayZ that I cant get back	 I'll be damned if i let a clone of it take my money again. I'll check up on the game a year from now. Asides from that	 Im done. Refunded. 1/10 trash jogging sim.[DayZ fanboy defense systems: ONLINE]"

TRASH.*edit* now theres a update where robots start immediately shooting at you and start hunting you down and can enter buildings. Great. All the most interesting parts of the map you can no longer explore without instant death. No point in even going to them honestly.Moderate learning curve once you adapt and learn to survive its pretty enjoyable. I just avoid the compounds and anywhere with robots in general they updated them to be more innacurate but the risks outweigh the rewards. Its just a shame alot of the main points of interest cant be explored or enjoyed without getting domed by robots. My main gripe with the game so far. Just hit 500 fame points.*So now theres less robots but now they aimbot you through ♥♥♥♥ing walls. seriously they shoot through the god damn walls. leaving 90 perceent of the interesting parts of your map unexplorable. how can you continue to ♥♥♥♥ up these stupid god damn robots every patch. dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing part of a otherwise great game.

Look up what early access means	 and than come back for the review. This is one of the best EA launches I have ever experienced with these types of games. The devs have fixed majority of the server issues within a few hours of release. The game still has some issues	 but nothing game-breaking unlike most EA launches. The devs seem to be committed to be launching updates really frequently to improve the game. The game itself is pretty solid for release. Everything works as intended and is really fluent. I see folks complaining about no content. This is DayZ on steriods. DayZ had the same concept but less. There is no end-game/progression in these types of games. It's all about player interactions and playing in groups	 and what you make of it. Hackers are another issue. I have not run into any yet	 but there are some out there. Considering the game has only been out for 2 days	 and the devs mentioned they will be updating anti-cheat real soon	 I am not too worried. Once again committed devs. That being said Scum is probably one of the better buys on Steam for the price it's asking for. The quality of gameplay you will recieve for the price is fantastic. And it can only get better from here..."

You place it where you craft it.- Seems other people can spawn on your shelter- FPS drop spikes- Nights look blurry like there is some gray overlay on my screen- Dropping stuff while you drink craft or anything bc your bag is full or hands -_-- Pooping through pants- Can't see my weener / Peeing through pants- People can kill you while you still loading the game- Can't zoom on map- Scrolling to sprint (Im used to it but why not just shift?)- Zombies can run / jump sick height / Spawns in front of you- Can't type in server name to find your friends server- Can't join friends game while in steam overlayAnd many more bad stuff.Priorities imho- Fix netcode- Give us good crafting + placement + lock on chests so we can atleast loot and lock up stuff- Better crafting system- Minor base building / walls / shelter / chest so we can store stuff safely- No jumping zombs- No zombs spawning in front of your nose- Optimization (game)- Remove lock on zombs/players in melee mode- Fix melee mode it's horrible- Add a bike or something to travel faster- Set some spawn zones where you can spawn 1 / Safezone 500m no PK possibleIn any case give us atleast some content so we can keep busy in this game so players don't abandom the game. Loot -> kill player -> get killed -> loot This is it.This game still has a great chance to be big and good.However at this point there is nothing really to do.I just log out in a military zone and loot	 then I log off and loot next time.Old review (release day)- Can't find friends in server- Can't search for specific server- Can't order server list"

I only bought this because Devolver Digital is the publisher	 and they rarely dissappoint.I hope the game will actually get all the planned features and that the developer doesn't take too long to implement them. I really hope this doesnt end like DayZ.So far it looks really promising and is already a lot of fun (at least when it's running smoothly and you are not walking for what feels like hours to get to the next point of interest)	 however you sometimes have to fight weird bugs	 server problems and lags. As expected...I wouldn't recommend buying this as of now. Only if you're really into Survival/Zombie Games like DayZ. It's definetly already better than DayZ	 but it's also still missing a lot of important stuff	 like vehicles. This game still needs a lot of work. I'll change this review to recommended once I can be certain that this game is getting the development and polish it deserves.Anyway	 I already had some fun and for this price I don't regret my decision to buy this game.But only because I love these kinds of games so much.A couple of things that I would really like to see asap and that are not too big to implement:- More zombies. Especially at night. The zombies and robots should be the real threat	 not other players.- Better instructions/information when hovering over stats/items etc.  I have no idea what effect that thing I just ate has on my body even though there are sooo  many numbers and information displayed.- Better Crafting Interface: Make it clear which items are missing and which are not or why you can't craft a certain item.- Field Of View Slider: Oh my god this is so important. First Person feels like a nightmare atm.- More scopes/attachments for weapons.- Bigger variety in buildings/interiors. Also add more safes or stuff like that in some random buildings where we can find some useful stuff. So that you're not forced to visit military areas.- Compass- Decrease the VoIP range and/or add volume dampening when the other person is behind a wall.- Add more sounds/better sounds for various tasks. Some of the animal sounds are super weird. And the robot move sound sounds like a baby crying."

Not every thing is bad though looting is great which most early access games find hard to produce anmy loot in a game zombies and mechs are ok and dont seem to under or over powered.

After crafting those	 I wandered to a small village that I spawned right next too. While searching in one of the houses	 I hear someone else rummaging around near me	 I can hear footsteps and items being opened	 being a noob and as curious as I was	 I used my mic to communicate. 'Hey! im new	 hows it going?'	 The dude responded ""Hey man	 yah im good"" 	 I asked 'How are you enjoying the game?' he responded "" yah man its cool	 still in developement	 but its cool so far"" i continue rumaging through various boxes stashed in the room. THEN out of no where i get smashed on the head with a shovel	 BAM! I suddenly realize hes going to try and slowly beat me to death with a blunt shovel. I grab my spear	 which im prepared to throw (mind you	 this is my first time ever playing	 the first 5 minutes) I wind up for the release	 thankfully the game shows u exactly where the spear will land	 I positioned myself around a bookshelf type barrier to create some room and prep time	 everything is happening so fast! ..... I release the spear. THUD	 his body went limp and it was quiet	 so quiet. i could see the spear logged in his head as he lay lifeless. {F to Search} the game says	 so I search	 this process removes all his equiped items out onto the floor. {Chop} the game says	 I now dismember and chop the lifeless body into many seperate body parts. I then grabbed lices of human meat and made my way into the hills off to the side of the town	 made a fire	 and cooked my enemy i once shared my first SCUM conversation with. In that moment	 realizing what I had been through to survive and to keep on playing	 I fell in love with this game."

As of 06/09/2018 there is overwhelming content at first	 but after few days the game just concentrates to PvP at airfield (64 players at such a huge map rarely provide enough other encounter possibilities and mindless looting will bore you to death after a few hours). Team deathmatch event is super fun and you don't risk anything. The only thing that really bothers me extremely are the glitchers	 hackers and extreme amount of lagging on official servers. It does not usually matter who has the better gear since when the server is kinda populated	 almost all players will lag to♥♥♥♥♥♥ which beats the smootheness of the gameplay to ground	 at times rendering PvP unplayable. I'm looking forward to future updates	 survivalists need more content (if survival overall would be more difficult	 there wouldn't be all the players just concentrated around the airfield)"

I've only played a few hours of single player	 but I can already see the potential in the game. Improvements: - The inventory part of the game clearly needs polishing	 but that is also expected at this stage of development. I found that items went missing	 and I couldnt find the option to eat on the skewer after it had been cooked. This happened on both skewers I had going. - Combat seemed confusing	 and it wasnt very clear when I was locked onto the enemy. However	 it was doable and it wasn't disadvantageous in a fight.  - Puppets (zombies) dont seem to notice you from a distance	 but I'm yet to determine whether this is a good or bad thing. Also could be due to the 'type' of zombie. - Lack of first person mode is a bit annoying	 and I hope that they manage to implement this in the future. - Survival features and crafting are awesome	 but again it can be hard to navigate the inventory system. Also	 even though I had an axe on my character	 it required me to have it held to be able to craft something	 which didn't make sense	 especially as he didn't use it when crafting...Again	 I've barely played the game much but these are some of the things I encountered when just starting.Also	 having bought DayZ the day it launched	 I'm glad to say that this game has launched in a better state than DayZ and with a lot more features as well.

Very fluid textures and high FPS	 even on a 60 man server. The environment looks and feels alive. The draw distance is excellent.. Managed to find loot quite quickly having searched a few small settlements.. An MP5 	 a baton and a pump action shotty. Animations and general feel lends itself more to PUBG than Day Z. Your char can leap through windows and vault fences. All actions are smooth and instantaneous. Inventory is inutuive and easy to manipulate. First encounter with zeds. Bohemia's effort is. Scum borrows much from Day Z but takes it to the next level. Environments are more interactive  and the game has a next gen feel. Its early Days for Scum but this is the definitve leader of the MMO Survival genre."

It takes the game to a new level of survival with the crafting system and the over all heath and stats of your player..  Keep in mind this is the early access so don't expect a polished game but I am happy with what I see.  The inventory system is idential to Day Z but the game is expanded with the crafting system which I am still learning.   This game actually has zombies in it and they can be difficult to kill.  You also have the threat of other players which makes the game challenging.  I have no experienced any memory leaks or issues with lag that some people complain about.  The game runs fine..

Tried single player mode first to get my bearings and it went something like this:Found rocks	 made a rock knife.Found sticks	 made a simple spear.Killed a deer	 used its hide to make a bag.Got one inch super punched by a bear (ragdoll physics FTW).Found a nice hooded jumper in a hut.Got attacked by a zombie (WTF - didn't realise there were zombies).Found ED 209 off of RoboCop but unfortunately for me he didn't want to be friends.Then I decided to give online play a go.  I got into the first official server I tried (which I think is where a lot of people are having issues) and set about looting a farm house.  This lead to a spade vs axe fight with a fellow looter which I lost.  I respawned and found a military bunker! Managed to sneak past ED 209 and tool up properly but the sneaky robot bastard was waiting for me when I came out.  This game is definitely worth checking out if you're to survival/PvP/battle royale type games.  Its sort of a decent mix of RUST and DayZ.Final thought.

Playing solo can be pretty frustrating	 so I recommend joining a squad. The things I think the game are missing right now are:1. Base building. Right now you can only build a simple shelter to respawn into.2. Vehicles. The map is pretty big	 and can get pretty tiring and boring trying to explore other sectors. Especially after you're geared	 because of the weight of the gear you move slower and your stamina drains quicker	 making it even harder to explore. The furthest I've gotten is maybe 1~2 sectors	 but after some exploring since there isn't really much going on you tend to go back to the crowded areas(ex. airfield	 bunkers). The game is pretty much worth the $20	 unless these types of games aren't your cup of tea.Fame points are easy to get	 either by killing or crafting.

I have to say I'm honestly impressed with the depth of this game	 considering it is only $20. From what I have seen so far most of the issues people seem to be having are either crafting related	 as in they just dont know how to use this system yet	 or with people lagging around in pvp situations / cheaters. As for the first problem	 most of the time people just miscount components or don't have a tool in their hand that they would need to use to make what they are trying to make. And now we get to the second issue	 this is an EARLY ACCESS release. People just either don't understand	 or refuse to accept that this means a game is UNFINISHED and STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. People seem to be expecting this to already be fully balanced for pvp and for them to have all the networking issues ironed out already. Yes	 it currently has issues	 but most if not all of them are going to be fixed over time. And as for the cheaters	 every single multiplayer game has cheaters	 they could add anti cheat right away if they wanted to	 but it would do nothing to fix the core problem. People would just buy the game again if they were banned like every other game that has / has had this particular issue. Eventually they will just get bored and leave.With all that being said	 I feel safe saying that if you have patience with the development of this game	 $20 is an absolute steal for the amount of content you get here just as it is. I've had more fun just meeting randoms to roam around with and kill zombies	 all the while cutting off their heads and pooping in their mouths. I can't wait to see where they take this game in the future."

It is in extremely early access as of this review	 so its optimization	 server	 and balance issues are understandable. Despite this	 the overall attention to detail is superb. The flagship feature is a deep metabolism system that changes your character's body depending on what you eat	 your activity level	 an so on. It also has tons of smaller	 impressive features such as tracking animals	 fist-fighting	 and a camouflage system that can render you invisible depending on your skills and clothing. If you like the survival genre	 you will like this game	 and I'm confident it will develop into a real gem sooner rather than later. Also	 you can poop off a dam."

I have only played it for 2 hours and was bored so i got rid of it. I know its just EA so hopefully the future is bright for this game and it doesnt end up like another dayz. The stats and character creation system is very neat and very detailed. That said it is a much more complex system for hunger	 hydration	 health	 metabolism	 etc etc. The movement seems fine not to clunky however the combat mode and shooting is horrendous. Dayz has em beat there but once again EA so there is hope of improvement. The map looked strikingly similiar to dayz's chernarus so i guess some effort to make it unique could have been done. Right now if you plan on buying and playing dont expect much. Lots of running	 lots of looting and coming up empty	 lots of running	 try not to get zombies or bots attention	 more running	 eating	 pooping	 repeat. I was on the ropes about this from the get go but gave it a try. Didnt really care for it but if you liked dayz and want a slightly different twist on it then give SCUM a try."

513710	1	4	elcapitandelbigdick	31	1	-1	1.4	September 8	 201	"To sum up the game: The devs decided to not include a simple toggle sprint button (which is usually shift	 in pretty much every single other game on the planet)	 instead they chose to give 3 'speeds'	 which are walking jogging and sprinting	 which are controlled by scrolling up or down with a mouse. This unlogical decision summed the game up for me and I knew it was developed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and incompetent idiots.  Furthermore	 the actual character bodies are awful	 every one to me looks like someone with extra chromosomes	 they look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the animations suck. They don't fit the 'build' so to speak of a prisoner.Lastly the actual story of the game sounds like an autistic kid played Day-Z	 Ark Survival Evolved	 and then watched some Beyond Scared Straight and made a game out of them all.... a ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME	 WHERE YOU ARE A PRISONER. Completely stupid idea made by a complete retard and the game just sucks so bad. I will definately be getting a refund on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game."
513710	4	0	zrocweb	189	5	-1	67.0	September 8	 201	"Can say that the game itself is not much different than other survival games.Biggest difference with this game is that you have to find ways to manage your metabolism	 urinate and poop and the occasional vomitting.  Outside of the the awesome job the devs did with the metabolism	 the game itself is just boring.  The crafting is overrated and over-complicated. Well done	 but it's DayZ all over again and I fear this dev team	 perhaps same original dev team as DayZ	 has loop-holed again and just pocketed 13.9 million off of sales in it's lauch week.Where is the rest of the game going to go. Who knows as there is not a clear path defined or visible anywhere. So familiar	 DayZ all over. There so called Puppets or otherwise known in-game as half-breed zombies controlled through their so called Tec1 terminals are just a stupid addition to the game that makes no sense in the concept of what they claim the game is about.  Way too many of them in areas where players need to loot with the addition of Mech Robots that kill on one shot you have to fight your way through the mechs and the puppets in military camps and other high points of interest in order to get into bunkers to loot.  Speaking of loot. The loot itself sux rocks.  There are so many items in loot boxes	 high areas as well as small towns and cities	 that just gets real old	 real quick.  Scissors	 duct tape	 paper and a wide array of other useless items is just one example you can expect to find in 95% of all crates	 boxes	 etc.. The fps is terrible and the servers are constantly being rebalanced as it appears the team has opted to put the load on the servers rather than the client who would be expected to support the load better than the server with a large multi-player environment at stake.Crafting times are immensly overrated and take far too long for most items.  You are constantly faced with dropping items from your hand to do the simplest of tasks that literally take one hand to do.  Inventory management is a nightmare as every item is single stacked with options for some items to have more than one use	 but if you have like 5 of the same item and uses on all those 5 items is not full	 you can't combine or join them	 so you continue to collect the same item over and over and fill up your inventory or clothing slots as the inventory is based on pockets or slot of your clothing.  Outside of the backpacks that are available in-game around towns and high military camps. Won't find them too often or not often enough as you would like to. But that is okay	 as you can craft an improvised backpack that give you suitable slots for awhile. But it fills quickly as you loot and need food	 vitamans and other resources to keep you metabolism balanced.  Puppet and zombie fighting is prioritized incorrectly as the player is always last on the ""turn"" side of a melee to the npc.  And speaking of fighting/meleeing puppets	 prepare to carry around a lot of rags/bandages if you fight them.  One hit from them and you get injured and sick.  If left unattended	 not patched via a clean rag	 your health will rapidly reduce to nothing and you will die.  Now the point of what I just said there is that you get injured and sick from one hit.  From what.  The puppets/zombies are	 as their PDF states not real zombies	 just controlled through their TEC1 control center.  So why would you get sick from them hitting you?  There is so much more that leans on the CON side of the game	 but won't go into that here.Should you get this game:   If you are a player who likes to play survival games and build	 then NO	 this is not for you.  If you like to craft and have to move items around from place to place and relocate your players body all the time just to craft (lack of inventory space)	 then sure.  If you like to waste large amounts of time roaming an overrated terrain size just to loot boxes and crates for the same items over and over and over and over	 then sure.  If you like to waste large amounts of time looting and crafting and gearing up to kill and/or get killed and redo everything	 over and over and over	 then sure.Player Builds:  Nope. None outside the temp shelter and crate you can craft in-game.  However	 let it be told that crafting these items is an automatic placement of the item(shelter/crate) and you can not move them once crafted.  So if you accidentally crafted your temp shelter in a spot you thought was somewhat concealed	 it's placed for you automatically based off your characters rotation position (never stated that anywhere) and your're screwed if it's not where you wanted it.  Same applie to your so-called crate where you can store you items you don't wanna risk losing when going into a Mech area.  Good luck getting them back if you don't have the Fame Points to respawn back to your shelter. Whats the point?  Yeah there are some	 but realistically	 no there is now. As contradictive as that just was...lolWeapons	 Guns	 are terrible against NPC's and players.  LOS with scoped weapons is terrible.  You can have 3 puppets about 300m away from you. Your looking at them in your character's view/camera.  Then you scope them from the same view and they vanish!  Hip firing/shooting is terrible and the guns seems to spray too much and targets are just not acquired as the characters aim is always off to the side and not centered as one would expect in a game and real life.  Scoping or aiming down your guns' sight is just as bad.  Forces you into a first person mode that is just terrible	 slow and unrealistic.FPS when around cities and towns is bad. Too many polys on building textures slows down the response to/from the servers to clients	 even on the lowest of settings	 is choppying and is even more important that if you are near a city or town or village an encounter puppets/zombies	 and you go to turn to them or around to them	 your fps spikes drastically and you'll soon be attacked and/or killed if it's a real player as you can't respond during the fps spikes and lag coming from the servers.Official servers are constantly being hacked	 glitched on and rumor is that Admins are on the Official Server teleporting around and killing players. WTF???Private servers are okay for the most part (I have one).  But you will encounter the occasional private server admin that loves to abuse their power.  I don't and never did or will.  There for the community	 not me.My reason for not recommending the game is due to the large number of copies sold or claimed to have been sold and just having a feeling it's DayZ all over again. The devs take off with their millions and leave behind a game that truely has no content and is just a waste of time for players	 in their real life.  ---TBD--- There is truely no purpose in the game outside of wasting time.  Yeah	 most survival games are like that	 but at least with those games there are goals and rewards	 something the players have opportunities to work for and towards.  Here with Scum	 you have no goal really.  I guarantee in 1-3 months time there will be no updates rolled out and/or this dev team will have branched out and moved on.  They collected their millions	 why not	 right?  They offer a survival bundle pack on the store page that give the purchaser nothing but a PDF and whatever else it claimed to have given does not work.  They say if your purchase the survival bundle you will recieve future stuff.  What stuff	 what future.  Where is it? When will it come? How often will purchasers of this bundle get and what can be expected.Don't give them your money!"

Yes there is a lot of features in the menus that are still not active yet but looks like there is lot more to come. Extensive Map with lots of areas to explore	 Puppets which are like Zombies to kill and few other surprises. This game is definitely going to exelent when it is finished and i can not wate for more features to be added.Things i would like see added to this game.Drivable Vehicles would be big help al the map is rather large.More Guns would be good too.Maybe some beds in some of the buildings where you can sleep and also respawn from if you die.All in all this is a good game at the moment for being in early access and i have high hopes for SCUM as it shows a lot of potential."

Unless you have a strong computer DO NOT BUY IT YET. i have 8bg of ram an i5 quad core cpu with a gtx 1060 6gb and i average 60-70 fps on high/medium settings. The game has alot of micro studder when it tries to render in things you havnt seen before.Some zombies teleport around	 can walk through doors and walls. This only happens rarely though	 9 out of 10 zombies work fine. When relogging you lose all your fame. many other issues. nothing that is super annoying or gamebreakingAlso if you want to learn how to play	 start out in offline mode to get a easier ride to good gear and practice with the weapons on the muppets (zombies)	 while you learn the map and where to find certain types of loot.Overall this game is great so far but does need work.

Early Access mean it’s a game in progress	 expect some bug or lagg! (Try switching server too kid!)For people saying: I got lag	 try switching server! Im in Canada and Im able to play on US EAST with my 8 friends in USA without lag	 pretty you sure you can too. (First one was laggy for my first character	 I switch	 then the 2 other servers was perfect without rubberbanding for my 2 characters)For 20$ you got a game that: Run in 1080p on High and Epic or in 1440p on High with 40 to 60 FPS (RX 480 8GB	 i5-6600K & 16Gb DDR4) Note: the game is made by 4 developpers only	 its something to expect that the game wont be optimize to run in 1440p epic easily or 2K on high like you do with other games. (Early access remember!!!)Have a ton of loot! Like	 when you die	 after 20 min. if you search the good spot	 you have everything back. (Not like Dayz when you run around for 2 hours without bullet or descent stuff)Pros:-Zombie animation	 when they jump	 attack	 run or fall from high ground are REALLY looking good!-No desync (When I shoot somebody from far or close	 he’s dead.)-No loot falling under the ground (When you wanna share stuff with your friend	 it doesn’t disappear! Yes	 I’m talking Escape From Tarkov bug right here.)-Loot of dead player or zombie stay on the ground for like 30 minutes (or more?) on Official server (So yeah	 if you die 10 min. away from your body	 yes you can go back and get everything back.)-IT’S A SURVIVAL GAME	 isn’t hard like Dayz but yes you lose all your stuff when you die.-You can team up with your friends to see their names (usefull in 2 vs 3 in a town)Cons: - Crafting system interface is hard to understand at first! (Yellow line	 red line	 white and black square)- I didn’t find any bugs	 but expect bug!***No more cons I can find	 game is working	 vaulting is working	 pvp is working	 zombie animation are incredible	 hunting system is working really well too. And the Mechs (robot) are getting fix soon in patches. For 20$ jump in and enjoy before price rise up. ***"

You can drop off a first story window and not break your damn legs. Just simple things like being able to climb through windows and over walls make gameplay feel so much smoother.It's still in early Early Access at this point	 so we're still waiting on a lot of unfinished content and bugfixes	 but I genuinely believe even in its current state that it's a better game than DayZ is even after five years in development."

Drawing from my past experiences I can definitely say that SCUM has some real potential to be a great survival game. The public alpha launch in my opinion was solid	 which is often a canary in the coal mine for survival games and the framework SCUM has in early alpha is already more than what other games have on full release. So far I've experienced hardly any bugs in game and the only complaints that I have so far is that finding servers and joining a friend's server needs to be made a bit easier	 along with a need for some form of transportation so that it isn't so much of a walking simulator. All in all	 $20 is a fair price for what content the devs have pushed out up until this point and a good investment for a game that will most likely get even better and rise in price."

This is the first survival game a developer team has ever put so much thought into. They already have future updates planned out ahead for the future	 you can clearly see it. Just look at all the missing skills that will be added in. ONE issue im currently having with this game at the moment is the peformance. No matter how low I put my graphical setting	 or my resolution	 IT  JUST  WONT  STOP  STUTTERING!. It drives me insane!!!	 when im trying to play. I looked up tutorials on how to fix the stuttering and it solved the issue moslty. Apart from having to restart the game every 2hrs or so to prevent the stuttering. Maybe I'm being ignorant and this is already a known issue in the game	 and the devs are working on it. IDK. If you have any questions on what kind of FPS I get	 I get anywhere between 40-60 fps on Scum	 medium settings. I still will recommend this game to people	 since now they finally added in ant cheat. It wouldn't make sense for me not to recommend the game just because of a stuttering issue. I seriously recommend playing the game. With a friend makes it even better. Sneaking into the military bases and getting lit up by those mech things is fun! Drinking river water till you explode with diarreah	 peeing on other peoples heads	 pooing out apples (some how) is amazing. If your wondering why there isn't much talking about pvp	 its because I haven't really found anyone. I joined a pretty populated server	 but I still don't find anyone."

I have a potato rig that doesnt even match the minimum specs so I have 20 FPS with constant stutters and low settings. They will optimize it for sure. I look forward to play it more in the official servers when it gets more stable. More details:THE GOOD-you feel the freedom in this game. The crafting is very intuitive and straight forward. You can literally live in the wild	 loot a couple civilian houses and you are good to go.-it doesnt take long at all to gear up with military loot. There are military bases spread across the whole map. There are also maps online with the military bases locations. If you run straight to a military base using the in-game map	 you manage to avoid the robots and zombies and you extract after doing looting	 you will be rocking.-THERE IS AN IN-GAME MAP	 THANK GOD. It really helps becasue it also tells you your location. You can also use it for running to villages/military bases and meeting friends. This is a huge positive for SCUM that is going to help the people who cannot play 12 hours a day	 unlike other survival games. -Zombies (puppets) are very consistent and you want to be careful. They parkour and everything and if you dont have a meele weapon/are good with it you are going to get rekt. Also	 if you shoot	 all nearby zombies run at you so you want to be stealthy and use meele weapons or spears which are easy to craft and very good.-right now you can craft storage boxes and a shelter/respawn point but you cannot fortify houses quite yet	 which will most likely be added in the near future.-they just added a working anti-cheat :DTHE BAD (temporal things)-the optimization is really bad. Even the guys with overkill rigs get low FPS so if you dont have a gaming PC it is going to be very unplayable. I know this situation will improve over time.They are real hard working devs and in the past few devs my performance has increased <3 and it is only going to get better."

You don't just start dying immediately when you haven't eaten like most games. The fact that nutrition is a matter of what you ate and not just if you ate has a lot of potential. Food variety seems endless	 and should be sufficient to support what the metabolism info demands.- Multiple layers of clothing with decent storage per layer makes it plausible to carry a good bit of material without being absurd like some other survival games. Is that a hunting scope in your short pants or are you just happy to see me?The bad:- Crafting is frustrating in many ways. Let's talk about rope	 which is needed in virtually every major early recipe. One tree bark rope requires 5 long sticks	 and the large bush is your only source of long sticks with your starting stone knife. One large bush might give you two long sticks	 more likely one. *And you can't carry them on your person*. You can carry one long stick in your hands.So basically you get to play fetch with long sticks. Get one	 bring it back	 go get another	 make a pile somewhere	 pray you can find the pile again. Strangely enough if you make a bundle of sticks you can holster them	 but you can't do that with a single stick. You generally need multiple units of rope to make anything substantial.Once you've crafted an object watch out because it won't go into your inventory even if there is space. This means you spend 20 minutes getting the materials for an axe only to discover that you're short a unit of rope because you forgot to pick it up off the ground after you made it. Extra expletives for forgetting to pick up the crafted axe itself	 which essentially vanishes into the forest floor when you're 10 feet away.I actually like the idea of utilizing materials in a radius around you	 except that radius isn't big enough. When you unbundle five sticks to make rope one of the five ends up out of reach and you can't make the rope without doing a little jig to get the five items in range.- Throwing melee items. Loot a town. Find a grand total of one item you can whack zombies with. Hit a zombie three times before throwing the baton off into the distance because apparently that happens if you hold down the attack button too long? - Fighting stamina. 3 str	 3.5 con	 medium melee fighting skill	 4 swings and you're exhausted. Would someone please bring the balancer over here?- One of the dumbest concepts for a video game ever. Take a few books and movies	 throw them in a blender	 and add mechs. Ooh and zombies! Err	 puppets	 yeah	 puppets!News flash - a reanimated corpse has a name	 it's called a zombie. This game is a pure day-z clone in so many ways	 why make up such a hilariously bad excuse for cloning the zombies?The deal-breaker:No item persistence in single player except for your inventory. No shelter	 no storage boxes	 nothing. You can't build anything meaningful in single player	 and you can't host your own server	 so there's basically no way to simply explore what the game has to offer without joining a multiplayer server where your stuff can theoretically be stolen/destroyed.EDIT:To include a note to this developer and all developers. Try keeping in mind that you have at least two distinct audiences. One audience is ""gamers"". The other is filthy causals who would like to be able to swing a baseball bat while crouching	 like a normal human actually could	 for the sake of beating the one zombie who got in the door.This is because some of us have jobs	 and lives	 and would just like a featherbed overview of the game	 and will simply bail if our time is being wasted. At which point you still have our money	 and we're not happy."

Hopefully the devs will stay dedicated and see this thing through. I personally enjoy the game in its current state. I was disappointed somewhat that dedicated server software was going to be private but	 it wasn't a dealbreaker. The game definitely needs work and I was fully aware of that when I bought it so I am ok with it. If you liked Dayz you will like this...its actually good that we are just at the beginning on this one. Use your own judgement getting the game but for my gaming I enjoy it."

Sure its fine on bugs and servers and lags	 but when people are giving gameplay feedback it sucks for this guy to be a mod.He allows users with his viewpoint to insult and say anything they like to the critics	 and will ban and lock threads literally based on nothing but personal dislike.This is a circle jerk community being led by a moderator who is chief circle jerker. I have reported him and provided screenshots of his bias	 but he literally locks every critical thread that isn't kissing♥♥♥♥♥♥and then finds ways to ban the people he doesn't like in said threads.Don't bother trying to have an input here. All I ever said were the issues listed below and I was told this is not constructive criticism its whining and I should go and minecraft. I was called a kid	 an idiot	 a loser and more. Some people were mocking me becasue they literally didn't understand what I said and I was banned for asking one of them if he was dumb. That was it.Avoid the community its toxic circle jerk. Devs are awesome though so dont tar with the same brush. I have reported everything so maybe they will do somethign about it we will see. He is literally the only mod getting involved with peoples discussions	 locking or banning. Most of the time its civil and the petty insults are mostly on the side of the people defending the game and yet he totally allows it. Anytime he wants to ban something he just calls it drama. Feel free to look  through the threads and see for yourselves.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Changing my review to negative after getting to grips with it properly. I would recommend holding off until a definite direction is revealed.SCUM is a game that is confused right now. It is trying to please everyone	 yet will please no one	 only the extreme fan boys that every game like this seems to have. Lost between a single player PvE PURE survival game and an open world MP PvP game. SCUM does not know what it is right now and fails at both in its current state.Pros=====- Looks beautiful- Really interesting and detailed character mechanics- Gigantic	 well designed map. Some of the POIs are breathtaking. I love the Dam.- RPG skills and stats- Advanced survival and crafting mechanics- Realism for the most part - Giant Mechs!Cons======- Very little to do- Badly optimised	 start at 90 fps	 degrades to 20-30 fps within 30 mins or so even on top of the range system.- Walking simulator (vehicles should fix	 if they do not take 3 hours to fix up as I feel they might). Literally takes 20-30 mins to get to the next village or loot area. Could take an hour or even two to meet up with a friend.- Loot is unevenly distributed. Either stupidly easy or literally nothing if another player has visited recently. Then another 30 minute run.....- PvP is terrible. You barely see anyone	 except at the military zones. But you dont really see them as everyone is hiding from the mechs. You dont have time to do anything creative in regards to PvP. Its laggy too which doesnt help. No variation or creativity. Just hide and camp for as long you have the patience.- Forget playing with your friends. The hardcore survival elements make it a terrible experience. Either exploit for FP (craft bone needles for an hour) so you can spawn on each other or prepare to spend most of your time running to each other. When one of you dies	 I guarantee its gg. Your friend won't come back. If you convinved him to buy the game he will probably be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you too. Theres also nothing to do as a squad. Camp a loot area	 thats it. But people either avoid or hide. Mechs keep you locked in. A weak experience repetitive experience.- No challenge for 'survivalists'. Tons of fanboys are saying the 'battle royale' kids dont know how to survive which is why they are hating on the game. Ironic as the game has no challenge at all when played this way. You are only at risk of boredom. Everything else is easy as long as you are happy to run for hours. Nothing more to it.- Anti third person mechanics are kind if stupid imo. You need to third person to evade mechs and move between buildings. Yet if a player is near you and you can hear them you will have no idea where they are as the anti third person mechancis mean all players are invisible unless in your direct line of sight. A nice idea in theory. Clunky and confusing in practice. Not sure why third and first person servers were not the answer here.... Right now you can see the gun and hear the footspteps so it makes no difference	 but I hear this unintentional and they are planning to make the gun invisible too.- Nothing to do (twice for emphasis)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCUM is trying to appeal the 'hardcore survival' niche market who dont play games that have PvP... yet setting it in a open world PvP MP environment. The Hardcore Survival elements will infuriate PvPers and squad players and the PvP camping in loot area will make the PvEers cry on the steam discussion boards.The fanboys dont care about anything and just say 'early access' and 'its only $20' and then quote each others comments in awe in some massive circle jerk. Theres like 20 or so of them.As a MP experience with friends it was painful. I got all my friends to buy it and I feel terrible now. Our experience was this. - Respawn til we are near each other at the cost of FPs. - Run for first hour til we are grouped up at a village.- Loot but not get much because 4 of us are looting same area.- Decide to go airfield as apparantly players are here.- Run  45 minutes- Evade mechs and go into loot- One of us gets a gun with ammo- Can see mechs shouting at other players	 but no way of getting to them anytime soon.- No food at this point even though we all eat on the way and had full stomachs before leaving- Out of boredom one decides to try and get over to other players.- He died after running into second mech he couldn't see when he set off- He is not running back for an hour so stops playing- We loot some more buildings the three of us and get a gun and a little ammo each- No idea if players here anymore- Trying to work out what to do now- Realise anything we do now will involve at leat 45 minutes run.- Realise to get where there COULD POSSIBLY be players could be a 1-2 hour run.- Realise we have done everything the game has to offer in terms of group MP- All quit unlikely to play again until major content and mechanic updates.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game has huge potential and looks great. Theres the base for a classic game here. Just needs to decide what its going to be and then make the actual game mechanics for either PvP or purest survival actually fun and not tedious.Desperately needs something for players to do.My opinion is to wait and see how it turns out. We can only judge the game on what it is now and right now its a solid proof of concept demo with masses of promise. Yet not actually a fun game in its current state.UPDATE:Power tripping moderators"

I play more of the survival/ exploration aspects of game and am having a great time. I also play solo on near 45+ capacity servers.The game has some network issues (that the devs working on and have already patch to some extent). But given the direction the game will be going I think its worth it to play it a bit now and then check back from time to time to see whats going on with it.

513710	0	0	BigBear789	181	23	-1	8.9	September 2	 201	I would definitely wait until this game makes some progress. It is very clunky and pretty barebones outside the usual military base and such that most of the DayZ players are accustomed to. As always just stay cautious of any Early-Access games including this one no matter the developer and development notes released.
513710	1	0	76561198095747286	163	6	-1	38.5	September 2	 201	"So let me start by saying I've been following the dev of this game since i heard about it ages ago and I'm very excited by it. So with that in mind; This game is fantastic. Its everything DayZ could've been and more. Its better than the breaking point mod. And it has some fantastic features and mechanics. But theres no way I can recomend this as it is. Why? - The mechs that guard bases are a great idea but need to be nerfed - Their pin point accuracy	 huge amounts of health and incredible ability to locate you no matter where you hide is just annoying.- The food and health systems are great	 but way over the top. You fill up on boar and vegies and after 5 minutes youre at starvation 4- The respawn at this build is game breaking	 wanna play with friends? You can either have an insane respawn timer while you try and get a close spawn. Or youre running for an hour whilst trying not to die of starvation.- The squad names only appear at about 50m which is pointless in a game where youre average engagement is 200m+. Also give us a means of setting permanant squads? so you don't have to meet everytime you play? - And perhaps the worst thing about this is that characters are saved per server. So if you join a high population server and get geared up. Then come back the next night and that server is empty	 well youre starting from scratch. I know this is to stop people gearing up on empty servers but isnt that why the mechs are there? Plus the shear amount of servers means that the population is stretch thin. IMO you couldve followed suit with Breaking Point and not let people host their own to keep the official servers populated. All in all its a great game. That will only get better but I dont understand why they've released in this state. Its only going to hurt the number of people who will stick around till the final build."

This game is stunning	 and it is VERY enjoyable being able to♥♥♥♥♥♥on someone's carcass after you kidnapped them and forced them to fight zombies to the death while naked. Although it has few things to do	 I could see myself reaching about 50-100 hours before doing everything JUST in the early access. For 50-100 hours of gameplay	 I think 20 dollars is fair; even more so when you see the updates they are planning to bring to the game. Overall	 once this game is out of early access I would definitely recommend it to every single person to at least try it out. If you have 20 bucks to spare and want to check the game out for yourself	 you can always refund the game if you only put 2-3 hours into it and don't like it."

The map is huge	 it's 144km and there's a lot of space to get lost. As far as I know 64 players is the cap on servers	 and it's a great  number. If you google for some Scum maps you'll see that there are roughly 50-70+ (I didn't actually attempt to count) locations to go. You'll find as long as you stay out of major areas you will be alone most of the time in a full server. Gearing up was tough at first	 but then you find out bunkers and any military type (Look for mechs) place will typically reward you with some armor	 guns	 and plenty of backpack space. I don't know how the loot spawns work all too much yet	 but the rates seem high. I honestly love that I can walk into houses in populated areas and still find loot. There's also the addition of capacity of loot as well as weight. So even something valuable will often be discarded for another valuable item to optimize your loadout. Performance:I've been playing since the day it launched and I have not had any real problems or bugs. I'm not getting a great frame rate	 but it's at least 30+. (i53.4ghz	 16gbRAM	 2SSD with windows install	 3 HDD	 2TB total. GTX960) The game has improved on performance in the last couple of days due to the hard working dev team. Overall I am happy with performance and the game looks gorgeous. Gameplay:I have to say	 this is pretty much dayZ. Which in my opinion this is just basic zombie survival	 and this team actually pushed out an amazing game. The metabolism system in this game is insane. It comes off incredibly intimidating at first	 but over  time you learn to read all those numbers. I often pop the menu up and read everything while I'm running to the next village. With a high level awareness and how dense the forest is you can get around fairly easy. I've been hearing vehicles are in the works for this game	 but for now all you get is your own two feet. Running around gets a little boring and somewhat annoying. I only say that because long distances will make you want to sprint. Then you have to factor in your stamina. You stamina bar will allow you to run again	 however your heart rate won't fully be stabalized. So you spring and now your stamina runs out quicker. You then find out that your heart is basically going to explode and now you have to rest for nearly twice as long. I don't know how far this goes	 but it just seems to get worse. It sucks for travelling	 but I want that in so I can chase down my enemies. Melee combat is really good in this game. You can block	 dodge	 kick	 punch	 all in a physics enclosed locked on area. It feels almost like a game of Tekken. I've been trying to brawl people on larger servers	 I was hoping it would be a respect thing in the game. If you run up on a fresh spawn you could at least go toe to toe with them on an even setting. Not for nothing	 you have armor. For the most part I ran into a lot of KOS. This game would be so much better if people actually talked over killing first. Gunplay I think is really cool. There is a lot to go into	 so I'll leave that to google and youtube/ twitch. Guns go off of skill	 this means if you regularly use a pistol you'll get better at the class of weapon. This will tighten your aim and reduce recoil. Your character's actual strength	 stamina	 health	 etc will also factor into weapon handling. This means that even if you are skilled	 you won't do much if you are tired. So by training	 getting proper food	 hydration	 and getting rest will make a huge difference in combat. Getting a gun can be tough. You can find them	 sure	 but finding the proper ammo as well as a magazine can be challenging. For the most part it feels like a more complex PubG shooting system. Long story short	 I enjoy the game. I'm waiting on a friend to pick it up before I really get into it	 but I feel like I'll be playing this one as much as I have played Rust."

Learning the mechanics takes a little time	 particularly the best management of eating	 wound care	 drinking	 and bio functions.  If you think that last one is just an emote	 wait until you are sniping along and your bladder gets full so you guy stands up to take a pee in plain sight of a mech.  Fat from the puppets is my preferred food as no cooking required and one space holds 5 eatings.  Large sodas can have as many as 20oz and take 2 spaces where the small ones only have 3 drinks.  Crafting ammo is easy just keep tools	 steel in some form	 and lead on hand.  For weapons I prefer the 9mm hand gun	 AK47 with scope	 shotgun	 AKS74U	 and the MK5000 knife.  For me it gets in sniping	 take down power	 easy to find/make ammo	 and high ammo capacity.  After some time I figured out I was wasting time carrying the hatchet once I had the knife and also found that AKS74u fits nicely in inventory (rather than a long slot on your back - this is critical for me as otherwise I couldnt have all these items and not run into having to laydown a weapon to eat	 patch wounds	 etc)I have only played solo so far and it is a fun game with great visuals.  I think getting through the first hour or so is the toughest while you sort out what you can do verses what you need to do	 same goes with the wide variety of things you can carry and craft.I found no where off limits as a soloist	 bunkers are hard	 and the airport definitely takes planning and patience but it was all great fun	 not grinding at all.  There are definitely moments where something totally surprised me and although that frequently translated into my death	 it was a pleasant thing to find it was both unexpected and yet very realistic for the situation - yeah I dont want to spoil those moments for anyone.Well tried not to go too long but give some insight - hope this was helpful to at least a few.-del"

They clearly do not understand what an early access mean. I have 3 hours of game time and enjoying it a bunch. the game is very detailed and overwhelming at first	 but once you figured it out	 you'll start to have fun. I myself liked the crafting system. It is very easy to learn and it actually guides you on what item you can craft if you have the materials or if you're missing some. I've been playing solo unfortunately	 wish I had friends LUL and the people I encounter are very reasonable. The amount of roleplay is off the roof. The zombies or the ""puppet""! they nailed it. they made the zombies to function like from those movies unlike in dayZ where the zombies are just dull. Loots are straight to the point. you go to a house you'll mostly find clothes	 food	 some weapons and materials to craft where as in the military section areas	 you'll find mostly military stuff	 but the risk is high due to the mechs. Sometimes you could also loot military items from the zombies. The game already has a lot to offer even in its early access stage. $20 dollars is very generous of them. This might be the best survival game out there and it will continue to improve. The devs listen to their player base and acts really quick. this shows that they care about the players and the state of game."

513710	3	0	Kodane	30	1	-1	25.5	September 3	 201	"MY HONEST REVIEWOkay so I don’t review games much but I see incredible potential here. Let me start off by saying I know I’ll get slammed by “I don’t have enough hours in game etc and blah blah” well I feel as though I’ve already experienced the whole game for what it’s worth in the short time I’ve played already. I realize this is EA and this is why I’m making this post because what I’ve seen is the developers are actually listening to the community which is my first positive. For the time I’ve played I’ve realized that I haven’t found a purpose for my time invested. You can loot for hours on end and craft as much as you can to pretty much achieve nothing at all which defeats the whole crafting system to me. So let’s say you have sat there and done that for hours. Next step is to build a tent and a box to store it in. Well you can’t lock the box unfortunately and the tent is more than less just a place to respawn rather than a refuge for the brutal and punishing game itself. So going this route to me is pointless. I wish it wasn’t because I would love to see my hard work pay off. Maybe some kind of crafting rewards/ achievement point system. Also I’d like a refuge to keep the items I’ve managed to bring back there. I understand that walking around you are risking it all and that’s fine and it should be left that way but for the people that just run for the military base and get end game loot to kill me after hours of hard work is just super brutal. And yes I know it’s a survival game but there is aspects of it that’s missing. Speaking on the military base. The base is a good idea but access needs to be harder to force everyone to just survive first rather than running straight there or the gear needs to be so few and far between it’s almost avoided until you can manage to get there after building yourself up to be able to. Maybe this will help the “let me just die until I can make it in there and gear up and camp everyone” tactic. PvP I have noticed more than once I get one shot. Literally one shot by an AK. I feel as though you should be given a bit more opportunity to defend yourself rather than just die to someone hitting you from behind or camping and waiting for you. Along with that there is no way to quickly regain any type of health back whatsoever. Bandaging only stops bleeding but replenishing health is grueling. Speaking on the BCU monitor. The system is very in depth and I have to hand it to the developers for the time spent on it. However	 it’s a little TOO in depth for me. Having to struggle and find the certain type of food for the certain vitamin I need is just too much. I understand we are going for realism here but we have to be logical as well. Closing this review I feel it’s a great game with much potential. I would love more than anything to see it succeed. I will not be asking for a refund or any of the sort because I’d like to see what the future holds. However	 things should be changed. I’m unclear of the direction the game is going..? Survival ..? Battle royale feel? Zombie ? I feel it needs to focus on one aspect rather than trying to implement it all and just being mediocre at it all. Maybe remove zombies? Increase the survival aspect of the game and the PvP will be much more rewarding and interesting rather than what it is now. If I could leave a mixed review I would but for now mine will be negative so I can get answers to where the game will be heading in the future. As of right now	 I can’t really enjoy it."
513710	1	0	76561198084732344	45	8	1	26.9	September 3	 201	"Good foundation	 what I mean by that is character/zombie movement is great. Melee	 throwing	 shooting mechanics are good. This in my opinion is more important at the start of a early access game release than being highly optimized. The current status of the game gives me the feeling that the developers are better skilled than other similar sized early access teams. Some early access games using the UE4 engine makes me feel they implemented a default character movement blueprint and just left it at that. I am not going to criticize the memory leak or jumpy netcode. What I am concerned about is the 3rd person occulsion system as of right now with this system and the netcode its like fighing a wizard	 players disappearing then reappearing ( a player runs behind a bush and disapears when they are visable again they are like 5 feet from the bush	 now imagine someone running in a straight path behind a line of bushes and trees). Its great that they are trying to fight 3rd person unfairness but not sure how successful this system can be. Not sure but currently feels like when someone jumps out of cover the time it take me to render vs time for them to render is different	 if that is so then someone could peek and get sights on you (before/same time) as they are visible. All in all I think this game can go far."

Or focus on the Single player with a squad system that could make this game 1 of a kind.It really doesnt need to be another PVP shooter	 there are over 10 of them that have existed for years	 the game has some decent graphics and the basics are there for it to be a true Survival Sandbox	 where you can lose your stuff but not to some idiot camping all the loot spots or some random noob camping on a roof	 been there done that	 got 20 badges for it in 10 other games that already do that. The potential is there for this to become a true Sandbox Survivor game	 the base stats and mechanics look good	 its a good start	 building fortification is coming	 crafting is getting more work and improvements	 and the setting is there for this to do something different. Personally I can see myself imerssed in trying to build my Scumbag a home and keeping him alive	 gradually stocking up my home with gear and venturing out into a changing world that presents new challenges with weather	 disease	 dangerous animals	 puppets and maybe Human AI that require quests and side missions to get really good loot	 building new things is I aquire new parts and stockpile stuff from around the island.The potential is there	 it can be great	 or just another DAYZ	 RUST	 PUBG spin off.....Ive purchassed it to help the devs with some money	 in 6 months time il see where its at	 its either a new unique Sandbox or a crap copy of games that already exists	 with zero return value	 I do not find good return value in games that you can lose everything because of another online moron	 i do find return value in something i can build and work on while having my survival in my own hands.

This constantly makes you have to re-do your stats which is annoying.*Some people suffer with bad lag	 especially in small towns.*No faster transporation like a bicycle or something simple.*Not many hotspots to loot eg: Airfield or Prison.*User interface looks sloppy and very simple like Miscreated/The old version of DayZ.There is probably more to discover but I'm going to wait for more updates to see what the developers will change	 I may refund the game now and buy it another time before it's too late. I hope the devs can change this stuff in the future so I can buy it again in a sale.(Removed comments due to toxic	 unnecessary and irrelevent people.)Yes I do have a perfect reason to moan as I've watched plenty of videos and even bought the deluxe edition to write this review."

I saw one pig	 who ran away from me	 and a big robot that I ran away from (not cuz I was afraid  or anything	 look he was like 20 feet tall	 you wold run too). I also did some other things...1. Made a stone knife2. Made a spear3. Went into a few towns and looted some boxes(most of which were empty)4. Found some stylish clothes and a sexy fanny-pack 5. Ate raw corn until I puked And that is it. It looks pretty	 The concept is cool	 its not super buggy (at least compared to other early access games). But here is the problem	 the core game play is running around from place to place opening up every drawer and garbage bag you find	 only to realize that most of them are empty. Doing that isn't fun.The PvE might be fun	 but enemies are rarer than a transsexual unicorn. Maybe PvP and player interaction could save the experience	 but the map is massive( like ur mom	 Zing!) and servers only hold 64 people.

So I give a long drawn out explanation as to why you shouldn't support SCUM	 then say... So I wouldn't recommend this game where it stands right now. The ironic thing is	 if we don't support it	 where it stands	 then it likely wont become what it can be. Either by having to get outside help and giving up some artistic freedom to get the game finished and money to be made for the new investor(s). Or sitting in development hell for a really long time and after years of getting trickle down funding they finally release the game but it has no where near the potential it could've had had it's players stood behind it.Now that I'm not young and I understand the point of what EA is about	 cause we never had this option for consoles	 and I appreciate some developers are trying to give us games worthy of the PC's we spend so much money on...unless you got a potato to brag to console gamers	 bout being in the PC ""Master Race""...with your potato...Wait for it....Wait for it...10/10 would take a liquidy dump on an enemies face over ""teabagging"" any day.This Game is absolutely amazing for being in EA!  There are no where near the bugs I was expecting	 for a game released in EA afew days ago	 I've played games in full release with more issues and not look as good as SCUM. The map is massive	 the details are extremely sharp and crisp. Trees look convincingly real	 the entire map is so close to photo realism. YES it has some issues...DUH...that tends to happen for games still in development. SUPPORT this MASTERPIECE! If this game blows up and get the support is DESERVES it will blow up and be way better than anything PUBG could ever spit out with it's ""slot machine"" gaming. If it keeps getting negative reviews scareing ppl away from supporting it...then it will be like any other game that doesnt get funding	 and sits in development hell...WE have the power to help finish making this game as awesome as the developer's vision has made it already. There have been things disappearing	 they just added the ability yesterday to ""store"" items in containers that are already there. I feel like there should be a limit to how easily the ""zombies"" can come after you...some of the skinnier ones can run pretty fast and vault	 not hop	 VAULT over a fence better than you. Which makes it a little hard to fight them off and catch your breath enough to be able to fight them. Some of these guys can move around better than us non zombified prisoners. I don't have many issues with SCUM at all	 I would rather see optimizing sooner rather than later	 as my GTX 1080sc is brought to it's knees playing SCUM	 getting me lower than 22fps if I don't put resolution scaling to 80%. Once I do that	 I get above 30fps in 2160p	 which is fine. 60fps is where I need to be optimally. There are some fps spikes and bottom outs	 depending on whats goin on...I hope they give us some ability to mark the map or zoom into it	 so we can see things a bit better	 maybe even leave a dotted line of the places we've travelled	 which I am sure some of which will eventually come.I've never seen the complex programs going on in entire games that these guys have got running your vital statistics...from how much vitamins your taking in	 sicknesses	 there are even meters for how much food you have in your system as it makes its way thru your body. Stomach volume	 intestine volume	 bowel and bladder volume. The level of detail this game has for just your body and its functions is mind blowing. There are plenty of streamers playing this game	 me included	 so check it out	 see for yourselves. This game has amazing potential if it gets the support it deserves. Don't listen to all the negative reviews bashing a game in development because its still being developed.  I don't see Rockstar	 Ubisoft	 or any other Triple A Developers with all their experience and infinite resources	 trying to give us games that are worthy of PC. We get ported crap from consoles. I spent a lot of money on this rig...so why the hell am I stuck playing games that are on console	 or old games that I grew up on and dont like playing anymore. Since I've been on PC	 about 18 months now	 I see all these games get love from PC when they weren't even MADE for PC. These developers	 that actually try to give us games MADE FOR PC	 get all kinds of crap from people cause it isn't moving along as fast as they feel it should...RDR2 has taken Rockstar 8 years to make! I guarantee it will have issues	 it still wont look as good as SCUM	 and it isn't even being released for PC..AND STILL it will sell like hot cakes...Imagine what kinda game Rockstar could give us PC gamer's if they wanted to	 it's like a slap in the face to PC gamers. Seriously playing consoles games on PC is like giving a race car	 87 unleaded. They are turning the gaming industry into Vegas with no jackpots...all these young kids watering at the mouth with these stupid digital nothings(skins & loot boxes) no wonder they keep giving us crap they can manipulate us with the chemistry in our own brains	 simply by giving us sub par games with crap you can buy to make you look ""cool"".  This does not seem like one of those games...it's only $20 for christ's sake! Well established developers aren't even giving us games half this involved...and it's just getting started. It's been a while since I woke up and couldn't wait to jump on a game again. I realize I might get some hate over this but I dont particularly care...I'm sick of playing games I've already played on console	 or the tons of games that aren't my style	 or old console games that are emulated	 very badly usually	 to PC. Give people some skins and they forget all about the half finshed and still broken games they pump out now. Same reason why people will not pay for a subsciption service to stop cheating	 but will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to put a piece of clothing on their avatar or whatever else ppl pay ridiculous money for on these games nowadays...I didn't spend this kinda money to play games on PC	 to be playing the same fudgin games as I was on my $3-400 console. SCUM breaks that mold.Look at PUBG finally getting fixed after over a year	 and after they've made so much money screwing us to play a broken game	 letting people charge ridiculous prices for skins and loot boxes because they can make a ton of money off of it. Instead of making the game they sold us on	 they gave us a semi completed version with all kinds of bugs and broken physics systems...they gave us skins and loot boxes and a bunch of brainwashed gamers ate it up. Now that I've put this down to try and get thru to the ppl that read reviews and can be deterred from supporting a game because of all the negative reviews	 by ppl who don't even understand the process of EA. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SCUM!"

It's not all sunshine and roses though	 it is still in early access so expect some bugs and glitches. Expect to enter a full server and within 10 minutes be completely cleared by hackers. Hackers run rampant later in the evening and almost makes the game unplayable due to their ""insta-kill-teleport"" hack. It might be worth joining a private server currently while they work on this. The dev team is pretty open about development features and notes but they haven't officially said anything about cheaters yet (Kinda concerning)."

Graphics looks really good in my opinion. the terrain feels like it should	 and the map is pretty big and fun to explore. the zombies work pretty good	 one is easy	 two is more challenging but still doable	 but the more zombies the harder it gets. the only problem I've had with the zeeks is that they can teleport through walls and as you might expect	 this is really annoying and it has gotten me killed multiple times. mechs are cool. there's a lot of lag.the problem I find most aggravating is the high risk low reward experience. there is really trash loot. about 70% of all I search is either empty or just trash items in. there really is no point in even trying to loot a military facility in my opinion	 unless you want to risk dying and if you survive you'll probably regret risking it. the loot is SO bad. my  first game I was lucky and found some pretty good stuff early on	 but now it's just empty.nevertheless	 I find the game fun and interesting	 I hope they will fix some of the problems and bugs	 and with time add more content. this is pretty much an improved dayz. it's not perfect	 but it's got it's charm :)"

Don't get me wrong	 it's cool and all but kinda pointless if a box of damn cereal wont even keep your hunger satisfied for 5 minutes. There's really nothing to do in this game. You run around	 loot stuff till your bags are full	 hope to find a bigger backpack	 then fill it again. Rinse and repeat. All the while avoiding zombies and mechs when you can.TL;DR Wait 6 months or for some serious updates before buying."

This game has been out for less than a week and they have already put out several hot fixes for game breaking bugs and exploits.  Anti Cheat has been implemented.  They are vocal and transparent about their development and plans for the future.  This game is already years ahead of Ded (Day) Z and has only been out for a week.  There are definitely flaws	 the game is poorly optimized	 there are likely a few memory leaks	 and the content is only a couple hours deep.But honestly if the devs keep up the pace they have been going	 this is just the beginning.

The community apparently for all this games are just chernobyl grade toxicity.The optimization is non existant	 being unable to play with a 1050ti with all in high its impossible as the game is bottlenecking RAM	 and CPU resources making both cpu and ram very overheated. Avoid if you care about your hardware.For the price tag i'd say its a robbery	 maybe its good for 3€ and to play with a friend in a single player game and try to discover good places in the map. And still is not a good idea as it doesnt have vehicles and will take you several hours to explore the map on foot.Don't buy this game	 its far from being a game	 its a tech demo."

One week after is still going the good way. Patches are coming fast	 devs listen to the community and overall is been a positive experience so far.Major nuissances ATM are:Lag/desync when facing other players	 usually when ""loading"" them in your vicinity and if they carry lots of items	 needs net code improvement.There's no punishment on eating raw and/or tainted food	 poisonous mushrooms and the likes.The crafting system is poorly designed	 they're workig on it tho.While nutrition system seems pretty good the health one lacks more deep	 a bandage heals all wounds and there are no diseases as far as I've experienced.Those points are not big deal and doesn't hinder your progress but stops you from further experiencing more indeep immersion	 remember the game is under development and barebones just now.On a personal side note	 everyone praisaes the overall beauty of the environments (wich I second too) but the skymap is awful at night."

Also since the small patch today the game improved a lot. It still has some minor bugs and a very small bit of lag here and there but the game is just amazing. The idea and concept behind this game puts every other survival game on the lower shelf. There is a learning curve from you arc lovers out there but you will pick it up fast.

Yes	 there are some memory leak issues and there are other performance issues but they can be resolved by checking out reddit and getting some guides on how to optimize the game manually. It IS an early access game	 so this is not to be unexpected. The devs I believe have been careful with this title to monitor the mistakes of games like Day-Z and to ensure that all of the broken messes in Day-Z do not exist in this game. Everything from selecting items within inventory	 to crafting with items in the vicinity	 to hand to hand / melee combat	 to running and traversing the world. All of those elements are superb and a giant step up from other survival type games.THERE IS A MAP. With a map marker location. Which means the gatekeeping of not knowing how to get anywhere included in games like Day-Z and Miscreated is no more with SCUM.The survival system is intuitive	 not overdone	 and is easy to learn but hard to master. You have to be very careful with what you eat	 and when	 and you can easily become over run and killed by a pack of Puppets (Zombies) if you aren't using tactics to eliminate them.There are PVP events you can get into at any time	 and it saves your survival characters progress and reloads you exactly where you were before. So if you want to get in some shooting practice	 or learn to use tactics against enemy players	 PVP events can help you accomplish this risk free.The game is not without cons. At present there are some issues with characters stuttering around a bit	 but the devs are moving at a fever pace to correct a lot of outstanding issues and they seem legitimately interested in pushing the game to be the best it can be. Unlike other games which have stagnated	 like Day-Z and Miscreated. You will likely have to turn the graphics settings down unless you have a powerhouse of a rig as the optimization just isn't there quite yet.You will also probably have to tune your mouse settings as the default ADS mouse speed is ridiculously fast for some reason.You can sometimes fall through the map	 and some random glitches with ragdolls do happen.There are many reasons to pick this game up. It does have a few hitches	 but with it's current price tag it is pretty much THE must have survival game title	 and there would be no reason that fans of the genre couldn't jump in and have an awesome time with the game. There's polish and fine details in this game where there has never been polish or fine details in other titles in the genre. Supporting the devs by buying it will also hopefully expedite development	 and the player base will continue to grow."

The skills system's effect on gameplay is pretty cool and evens the playing field so those with supercomputers can't set their render distance to highest and see you sooner.Netcode is iffy and the memory leaks are bad. It's pretty barebones content wise too. They sold a lot of copies of this so let's hope they finish it properly.

In scum there is only 1 game and death is a much bigger deal. I'm not prepared to spend several hours building up my character and gathering loot	 just to be instantly killed by a hacker.

The crafting is very easy to figure out and use. I like the concept better. The attributes and skills. ( More on that below )The death is not so bad as the story tells you why your here. You were most likely going to die anyway.  I went into it expecting to be quickly killed by others. I wasn't. I had enuf' time to figure out how most things work. Craft some nifty primitive stuff. Find some clothes.Then I died. But the death was not horrid. Two guys jumped me with firearms. I had a stone spear. I hurt one of them real bad. He might have bled out	 I don't know. The character attributes make the whole sooo much better. It's possible given a better melee weapon I could have finished off the one shooter. I am not really big and strong	 but I have a lot of Constitution.

The Devs have made some smart moves with most player stats being checked by the server	 I would like to see current weapon ammo being given a server check if possible and maybe a moving too fast check to prevent teleporting.Still every game has issues at launch and the developers seem to be working to get anitcheat in and fix the issues so can't really give it a bad review just because of people who can't play without cheats."

Whether or not the devs stick to their roadmap	 ignore the haters	 and continue to make the game even better remains to be seen.As it stands	 you can have fun with the game even in single player (provided your hardware is up to it	 this is not a slouch of a game) but the meat of the game is multipler pve and pvp.

Assuming these get worked out and the game gets continually improved	 I'd say it's a must buy if you're into the whole DayZ open world survival genre.

Its loot system is pretty basic	 building is complete rubbish	 you cant choose where you want to place things and it is accessible by anyone but you cant even defend it. So storing loot is as big of a risk as taking it with you. There are robots in the game that make looting high reward areas a challenge	 but they are also glitched	 for example : They can shoot / see through a lot of objects. Now then	 the worst thing about this game is the disgusting combat on ALL servers. 1. Some guns	 including high powered bolt action rifles take around 5 body shots to kill someone where as some guns	 for example the ak-47 can kill someone in a few quick fired shots. And the worst part about the combat is the enemy players glitch around and teleport everywhere so it makes shooting a moving player almost impossible. And I also noticed a glitch where players would go completely invisible for a few minutess but they can still see / shoot you. Hackers are a common thing in this game too which ruin it a lot. So all in all. Dont buy the game yet	 let the developers work for their money by actually making the game playable."

This game takes elements of ARMA	 Rust	 and Day-Z and combines them into a world where you are a prisioner on what appears to be some game show. The game does not currently have an overall objective. However	 the graphics and features are amazing	 even playing on a i7-7700k w/ 980 TI. Some of my personal views on the current state of the game; calories are unbalanced	 skill progression is far too slow	 AI is weak	 and combat is somewhat clunky. Curently I burn like 16K calories with my activity but reguardless of what I eat I only can consume 6-7K. Sugars and carbs are almost impossible to come by. Skill progression increased SO slow	 I have to run around cutting down hundreds of trees and crafting all sorts of low quality items and still only manage like a 1-2% increase in skill. AI is very predictible	 the mechs need like an area radar or acoustic sensor. Currently they only operate on sight. Zombies have pretty much one attack	 side stepping hit	 side step	 hit	 zombie dead.Things I'd like to see:VehiclesStealth Kills - ZombiesMore powerful weapons to use against mechsMore constructable items - think Rust!Easier party method - join as party!More zombies - mainly in bunkers and towns!Placeable constructs - currently it only erects to your back right.Re-balance the food-calorie system	 pretty much alwasy 0% ENG.Overall this is a soild start to a game	 the story idea seems interesting	 the base of the game is solid and stable	 and the devs certainly care about combating cheaters!I will continue to play and support this game if its progress continues!PS: I'd love to get my hands on the server files as I run my own gaming servers for my gaming community!"

Some more PvP events in the future would be fun. Magazines or at least 1 magazine should spawn with weapons tho	 its a pain in the pooper finding a MP5 2 times in a row without a magazine for it	 single shot SMGs are not fun man	  otherwise you can aswell call it DayZ 2. I really hope it wont end like that and they come up with some more  good ideas and more content	 because the core is fun	 especially the attribute and skill aspect. The character should be transferable across servers by choice tho	 considering it takes ages to level up the skills."

Spent half an hour looking through villages for food as my character began to starve. Found one can of sardines and a mushroom thing that made my character spew. As far as I can tell	 there are no backpacks around anywhere so you can't store much	 and there are no means of transportation that I can see so you spend forever getting between villages on a faint hope of finding SOMETHING to help you progress.Eventually found a rifle and some ammunition. Aiming down the sights for a character spec'ed as a marksman did nothing. Basically every shot missed (1/4) - not even sure if I had an aim marker.Sure	 I haven't played a heap just yet. However	 there's no way I could recommend that anyone buy a walking simulator that has all of the free roam certification of ArmA and none of the charm (or loot availability) of PubG. Wait for further updates."

I have wasted twice for restarting new characterNot recommended if you cannot endure constant lag	 its so frustrating ! No zombies or players and lag ! Although i do not have a good computer	 even Shroud has less than 60 fps while playing. Even Shroud lagged during PvP. Quote from Shroud's streaming : this game need 3 years to be where it wants to be !Recommended if you like realistic survival game. Slow-paced gamed. HUGE map with no vehicles and jogging takes a long time. Sprinting require resting to recharge. Cons : All towns are useless. They rarely give weapons or resources. Its a waste of time to bother looting towns unless getting clothings after respawn. Everyone would rush to military bases guarded by robots for the best loots.Food system is weird. Be able to eat raw human/animal flesh and not getting sick. Its gross and unrealistic.Pros : Its a excellent idea by developers. Scum has major potential	 it can improve greatly or fail miserably."

I'll change my review once some of the bugs are fixed but as of now I can't hardly play.I only played single player to try and learn the game	 and within the first two or three days of playing	 I encountered the following:-After alt tabbing for more than a few minutes at a time	 my computer would die when putting the game back into focus. It just about literally had to reload itself except at .5 fps in game	 took a few minutes to sort out.-The system for needing to select multiple items for specific actions is unintuitive and obtuse. Took me ♥♥♥♥ing forever to figure out how to cook meat on a skewer or how to use a can opener. With a can opener in your inventory	 you can't simply open cans by right clicking them and selecting open in the context menu. You must select both the can and can opener	 then the context menu shows the ""open"" button. Why. Also	 selecting items in itself is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying as unselect all seems to come and go  regardless of whether I really have something selected. It's just difficult and annoying.-There's really not much information anywhere at all for how different skill levels impact gameplay	 or what some skills even do. -My skill levels glitched out a few hours into playing and turned red	 don't even know if I had the correct skill level or if the game was just glitched. Impossible to know if I'm receiving any benefits. -Boxing is just about useless	 as a slow attack speed combined with fast enemy movement speed will almost always result in a lot of injuries. -Crafting menu is extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unintuitive and clunky	 can't stress this enough. Some crafting options seem to come and go for no reason	 requirements are obscure	 sometimes can't craft something even with ALL the materials. Maybe something about some skill level I DIDN'T KNOW THE NAME OF limiting my options. I reloaded the game at this point and all the items I spent so much time getting had disappeared off the ground. Never found a tool box again. Horrible single player experience	 can't even experiment without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this-After about a collective 5 or 6 hours in singleplayer exploring the map and trying to find equipment	 I finally found a bunker	 and managed to run inside without getting killed by the robot AI's. I spent a long time looking through everything inside	 as well as eating everything I could as I'm pretty sure my sugar level was glitched	 decreasing from 150% to 0% after only a minute of running. I found a lot of good guns and whatnot	 and as I went up a stairwell to make my way out and play around with everything I found	 my character suddenly teleported a few feet to the side of the underground stairwell	 putting me under the god damn map	 killing me ♥♥♥♥ing instantly. ♥♥♥♥ this game for that. .9/10edit: A day or two after this review	 the devs updated the game	 fixed a lot of bugs	 some I hadn't even realized were probably ♥♥♥♥ing me in game	 so that's great and I changed the recommend. As long as the rest of the bugs are fixed eventually."

When you die you have a choice of respawn locations depending on how much fame you have acculated	 but you drop absolutly everything and have to start over.  Yes you can go back to your box	 hoping no one has found it and somewhat resupply.  Other then that you have the PVP element which is just like anything else.  You win or lose	 gain or drop your stuff and start the process over again.  Its actually pretty boring.  Looks cool	 but long term boring at this point.  Maybe being able to craft buildings in the future for security will help	 but then it's still just a nice looking version of many other Zombie servival games.

And when I say ignore	 they are actively ignoring FPS	 stuttering	 fatal error crashes and similar issues. And there is no indication from devs or the company in general that they are going to work on it.As of right now	 I got my $20 worth and am happy with the purchase. I can only hope that one day the game will play without too many issues. We'll see."

Might as well loot for your food and not bother with the interesting hunting mechanics. I decided eating doritos and corn was the easier way to go.Was scared of all the people saying rain was a hazard. Ran for an hour during nighttime and was fine.Also ties into the campfire mechanics being useless since my body tempurature wasnt affected by my campfire.Which also ties into the lack of feedback with any mechanic in the game.How long does a cmapfire last? who knows.. How cooked is my meat? who knows...My component need to be at full health in order for my item to craft? oh thanks for telling me...My shelter doesnt provide any sort of protection? too bad i spent 20 minutes moving 5 sticks around...The crafting is terrible.Calories in and out is one thing. But to measure vitamins and minerals when food is so sparce is completely mind boggling and begs me to ask the same question..Why? Why should i measure any type of vitamin defficiency when i have to eat everything i come across to keep my calories from going negative.Any article or video ive consulted to try and figure out certain problems have all ended in the same fashion. they dont even know what their doing either.This all leads me to the final part.the community is already toxic.but not for reason you may think.people seem to be brainwashed into thinking this is some in depth game.(most of these bodily measurement are purely fluff) and its true...the reason why this community is so toxicthe game is so bad at giving the player feedback about what he or she may be doing so much so that the few people who have figured out the strange nuances are left to scold any players who may be confused under the guise that ""confused players are just people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning because the game isnt on easy mode"" and ""if enough casuals play this game and complain then itll be dayz all over again""no the game isnt complex. its just put together very terribly.no its not some reality simulator.its just a game with too much going on for no reason.its dissapointing to see so many people defending and be turned into apoligists just because their favorite streamer played it a few times.to be honest 90% of stream highlights on youtube are clips of people♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on each other.big streamers will not be playing this game in a few weeks if it stays as confusing and overengineered as it is.then players will fall offIf youve made it this far i hope youve taken this with a grain of salt because i really think this game does have potential...just not in the way its meant to be played now...."

It's extremely entertaining with the bare minimum of features within the game. Zombies and mech's are the only NPC's in the game and they already make it a challenge. Throw in players battling for loot and you've got yourself looking over your shoulder everywhere you go. The map is huge but it doesn't make you feel like it's impossible to get anywhere. You can hunt things with a built in mechanic and the random encounters with players keep the game fresh and interesting. I can't imagine what this game will be like in a year	 the dev's are doing a really good job at communicating and attempting to address concerns. 10 of 10 will poop in unfortunate times again."

Like any other survival game	 except you get to urinate and deficate when you need to (yay?).

The controls feel nice and with a few small tweaks could be really easy to use. As I have not interacted with others on it so I can't speak of that yet but going by the many vids done by the developer and other users	 this game has some features that will set it apart from the rest of the survival game market.  The detail they are trying to include with this game has set the bar very very high for others to follow and if Scum nails it	 will cause all other delevopers headaches to match never mind better.You must remember that this game is Early Access and as such the content is limited right now.  It will come..Have Fun."

I want people to start giving quality design ea games good reviews. If I felt like the devs didnt care about the design of the game and it seems to have NO potential then i warrant a bad review. Why kill player numbers or not help the numbers over cons that are PURELY a flaw of being EA but no a review of the game itself. This game reminds me of infestation: the new z which i liked really well even though the graphics are dated. This is just like that but better physics. I enjoy making zombies follow me while i loot. Then i can kill 3 dummass playas tryna to melee him hahaah see u on the field bois.THE 1 EA FLAW I GOT CARRIED AWAY FROM is the lag when fighting SOME players I suspect there are not many foreign servers as of yet. BUT those 3 guys and the guy i killed at the mech base didnt have any lag and the game ran great pz

It's not like it says ""This game is not complete"" or anything. After only 2 hours of gameplay	 I can already confirm that Scum will be better than DayZ SA. Developer's had a rough launch but was quickly sorted	 loot isn't scarce	 there's a lot to craft right on launch	 and the mech's are a nice touch. The map is big but there are a lot of areas with loot to make up for it	 so you don't HAVE to run all the way across the map for a good weapon. With my build	 I get 70-90fps on medium settings. Just read the recommended specs before buying the game. And also	 stop whining in the reviews making a game look bad with your ignorance.

Gun play is ok but hand to hand combat is a bit poor.Looting is very good	 I'm always finding something new and there is just enough food/drink to keep yourselves healhty. Backpacks are hard to come by but easy to craft in a complex crafting system that I am yet to fully explore.The metabolism stats are intresting but i haven't really seen any of them making any major effects as of yet.With more time I think this could be a very good game and I'm looking forward to what the devs do to improve this game.I would recommend this game for anyone wanting a survival game."

Difficult crafting at first	 but its pretty easy once you learn the fundamentals.Progress feels a bit redundant once you get geared	 but i have faith this will improve.Not seeing many ppl	 in a 25 person server bc map is so huge.

I can play many graphically demanding games and many are unoptomized and i still can manage to run 60+fps in those games. This game however	 is so poorly unoptomized to the point where I cant even run it on the LOWEST of low settings. I cant even turn down post-processing cause it keeps turning itself back to high. During combat with zombies I would get terrible lag spikes that get me killed and I simply cant enjoy the game at all. If you dont have atleast a 1080 or better I HIGHLY recommend you dont buy the game unless you're prepared to lag your♥♥♥♥♥off.

It is a complete lie. if you're not rolling with a 1080 6gb+ then have fun with the lowest setting of graphics and occasional frame spikes especially in towns.

When I bought this game I had the thought it would probably go the route of DayZ but boy was I wrong quickly. There is a huge community and we have had patches like every single day since it has been out. If they keep this up I will definitely recommend it to others.State of the Game: So far not much to do. no vehicles	 no dropzones	 nothing but scavenging	running	 and killing people. Sounds like DayZ right? Well yeah... but the devs seem to actually care about their game and it seems like this game has MUCH MUCH more inbound. If you look at the admin spawn list you will notice there is a ton of stuff not enabled yet so definitely keep yourself in the loop with recent updates.I recommend this at its current state as a DayZ replacement.xSMx Gaming-HIGH LOOT is our server	 come hang out."

I was definitely withholding any excitement prior to release as early acess survival games usally have the tendency to be dissapointing however upon playing this game I was very pleased to see the state of the game and can see a lot of potential. Yes a good amount of things need doing as expected from a game in alpha	 there's plenty of features which need adding	 as well as a good amount of polishing and fixing	 however the developers are keen to keep updating the game and they seem to listen to what the community has to say which is rare to see nowadays	 so that's a big plus. A lot of people say this is the DayZ killer	 whilst I agree it is superior to DayZ in a lot of ways	 DayZ has been dead for a long time now and this game cannot be said to kill something which is already long dead.TL;DR: So far so good."

The developers thus far have been very good about communication with the community and as such I have high hopes for this game. For $20 it's definitely worth a purchase if you're interested.
513710	2	0	Xuatho	160	7	1	27.3	September 5	 201	"This is what DayZ should've been. An open world survival game with updates and actual support. If you don't like Rust	 DayZ	 or survival games in general; this game is not for you.TL;DR: Great game with very huge potential with very active devs. 3 patches to make the game better in under a week. I highly recommend supporting the devs on this game. TL;DR score: 7/10The Map.Scum features a 12x12km map to run around in. In it; you'll find many military bunkers	 military areas	 restricted zones	 towns	 villages	 trenches	 and more. There's one problem in it though	 and DayZ standalone suffered from this problem too. No vehicles. This game is completely reliant on your patience of running from point A to B. There's also another issue I'll bring up later	 as it makes the game a little more tedious	 but only somewhat involves the map size.Gameplay.It's a survival shooter. It'll work pretty much as you expect	 with an added twist. Hunger	 thirst	 and everything else is mandatory. This game combines realism in its survival. You have an entire tab in your inventory menu dedicated to your metabolism. This screen shows your skills	 levels	 breathing	 stomach volume	 intestine volume	 colon volume	 and bladder volume. You read that right	 you will need to go to the bathroom many times during your short life to not suddenly drop what you're doing to suddenly bend down and expel your explosive diarrhea. Your weight also matters	 making you either slow	 or drain your stamina very fast as you sprint. Overall	 this is a very welcome edition to a survival game. It actually makes it a survival game.Gunplay.Previous segment was getting a little long	 so gunplay has its own segment. It's a very solid experience. It feels like a mix of Arma	 Battlefield and Call of Duty. It's also worth mentioning that your skills and how healthy you are affect your gun skills. How fast you reload	 how steady you are	 recoil management	 etc. So stay healthy and eat your greens kids.Players	 Network	 and Servers.The network is a very clear work in progress. They've already released a first wave patch for the network and I can say that it shows	 very much. Players lag a lot less	 actions are more responsive	 and overall a better experience. One of my gripes however	 is that I tend to lose connection to a server rather easily. Granted	 it could be my fairly bad internet of my current location of writing this review. Another issue I have is the player count. The max I've seen is 64 players in an official server. And you thought PUBG was a snore-fest. Ha. You read that right	 64 players in a 12x12km map. Usually I wouldn't say it's a big issue	 but when a faster paced game like PUBG has 100 players in a 8x8km map and is SUCH a bore to play	 this is absurd and an issue that needs to be addressed very soon.Overall.It's a fun experience	 but since you'll be running around	 or in a straight line for a long time to get to each location; I recommend bringing a friend along. It'll make the experience at least somewhat less boring in the massive downtime this game has. However when the action starts	 it can get intense very fast.Early Access Score: 7/10Does a lot right	 but even more needs fixing and optimisation is required. Also	 mechs are spoopy with their new voices	 plz send help."

The biggest issue Scum currently has and it is a big one is dsync during combat; it is entirely possible you will shoot at a player only to then see him right next to you blowing your brains out	 but I'm sure this is something that will be addressed quickly. Other than that	 this game is solid	 with fun survival elements	 an enjoyable looting system and a great developer/publisher team on board.I highly recommend to those who love these types of games."

When you spend wayyy too much stamina if you have low STR and if you have Low Constitution you dont have the RUnning skill which increases your overall speed.For short	 this game is bad	 its fun to play with a few friends for a few days but i'd reccomend DayZ .62 over this at the end of the day."

There are still a good amount of issues to be worked out but this is a good start. Right now I would say this game is already more enjoyable than Rust	 WarZ	 H1z1 and Ark was to me	 even on day one. As for how it compares to DayZ (0.63)? It does some stuff better already (pvp/pve mix	 all the details of your character	 looting is better implemented) and DayZ does some stuff better (much better combat	 graphics are better and I get better performance in 0.63).Overall this is pretty impressive when compared to other games in this genre on day 1 of EA. Remember arks horrible performance and server issues? Remember DayZ Standalones issues when it first dropped? H1z1 and Rust had there fair share of issues on day 1 to. And don't get me started on WarZ. This game is much better and is the complete opposite of the trash that was WarZ. I really do hope this game does well and continues to improve	 it is a good start and already better than most online survival games out there. If you are looking for a new survival game give this a try	 it has a bright future. As long as the server issues and combat gets worked on in the future	 I am all in on Scum!"

Thats what sold me on the game how much detail they put into it. Yes they have had server issues on launch day but that will be fixed and single player can still be played. Server issues are to be expected with a lot of player joining launch day 90% of EA games do. If your going to winge about it then wait until they have brought some updates out. Don't buy EA games if your going to moan about glitches lol. Brilliant game though so excited about this game.

The devs are fast to make patches and they listen to the community	 to me	 that is a huge part of a good game. Difficulty? It's initially difficult to figure out your inventory	 crafting and your health stats. You have to play and learn how to manage your health. Your initial character set up plays a huge role in your gameplay so make sure youre paying ttention to your creation process :) The numbers matter. Dont forget to poop and pee ;)The map is huge. You wont see many people even if the server is full. I think 100 person servers would eventually be better. I can go 3 hours without seeing anyone and thats not good. I would like to see zombies everywhere	 not just around the towns	 but also a few out in the forest.The sound is a little funky. I can hear water when im in the middle of the forest but there isnt nay water or rain nearby. Its early development so Im keeping an open mind. I hope this game becomes something big.

You can hit the end-game gear in just a few hours	 and after you get to that point	 there really isn't much else to do other than roam around and kill people. Coming from Escape from Tarkov	 the gunplay feels much less weighty and the weapon sounds are pretty terrible (hopefully they are placeholders). The inventory management can also be quite awkward. I give it a 5/10... give it some time and it may evolve into a great survival game	 but at the moment it is a little bit over-hyped in my opinion."

I don't particularly love playing solo in it	 but with a friend or two it's a crockpot full of fun	 and human meat from other players who hopefully had fun before you chopped them up. Most people don't KOS	 and the PVE is challenging enough to give advanced players something to worry about beyong other players.

Its basically loot	 run to your hidden boxes	 deposit	 rinse and repeat. Im on a relatively low pop server but the map is absolutely massive and going anywhere long distance takes much preparation and a willingness to leave supplies behind. There's no real reason to explore beyond your base as the loot seems to be the same everywhere. Melee takes a bit to get used to but before long the zombies are more obstacle than threat. Learning the crafting system took a little while too but wasn't difficult. There's a lot of trial and error. Handguns are plentiful	 ammunition uncommon and magazines rare. Gunplay takes a backseat to melee due to its rarity and utility in cities. Its fun by the crafting system leaves a lot to be desired. A scant handful of weapon recipes some utility recipes and that's about it. There is zero base building to speak of but you can drop boxes to stash items in.  There is nothing in the way of a tutorial	 you're literally dropped in the middle of nowhere with nothing and no tool tips	 no quests	 literally nothing. Its a fun game	 but if you're on the fence I'd hold off and wait for them to complete the game a little more."

Good job dev team.We still need some critical features worked on.Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz Video Card NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 RAM 16 GB Operating System Microsoft Windows 10 (build 17134)	 64-bit- The D-Sync across all servers is terrible.- I have noticed the game is not optimized at all and my GPU is at 99-100% at all times when render resolution is at 100 on medium graphics. This is unacceptable with my build and attention is needed to this area. The fix I found is running on low	 with render resolution at 60 and my GPU is at 70-80%. I run a stable 80-90 fps with these settings.- Crafting. I needs so much more attention. I feel like most people in the game just keep commiting suicide and go for the military areas and go straight for the good loot once they get a good spawn point. This is not good for your games future people will get real old with this fast! Maybe make some type of trip mine or land mine to kill the robots and get parts for some amazing loot instead of getting it all just by dodging the robots. Put like an m249 barrel in there. Then take the parts to a work bench and craft the m249 and you can craft the bullets with items already in game. This would cause players to run for the explosion sounds because they would find out that there is someone trying to get a good gun and they want to try to kill them when they get it. Or you could make it where when the explosion happens a horde comes out after the player	 killing the zombies would give you more fame points and would solve the problem with players restarting their charaters over because they are so far in the negatives in fame point from spawning at military bases. Other than some key features and bugs needing worked on	 the game is great. I honestly like the game right now because I see the devs are staying up with the community needs (I understand it's not an easy task to do). It shows potential for the game. But one thing I do ask is you work on the optimization sooner than later because eventually people are going to not enjoy it. Also spice up your game a little more by adding on to your key features of the game to make the players experience longer. Thanks	 hope to see future updates."

Very Big Map! Which is good but it takes ages to go anywhere. Mechs in restricted areas are too overpowered and dont drop anything cool. Not a diverse amount of guns. Hopefully most of this is fixed while the game develops. If you are planning to buy this wait a little longer. If you really want it wait for a sale. Hopefully they implement an end goal eg espcaping the island. My wishes for the game are - Bigger arsenal of guns eg m16 or m4a1 and more attachments. - Base building (Like the game 'The Forest' - and vehicles eg cars and helicopters so the game isnt a zombie hiker simulator) To get rid of mechs and replace them with modern turrets and finally i hope they add partrols which players can attack and loot from. Overall im not recommending this game as although it is very fun it is still very empty as there is not alot of content.

I don't recommend hunting a bear if all you have is a sharpened stick.  The game looks good and the map is super big with lots to discover.  It's just really difficult to advance my character before randomly getting pwn3d by something and having to start all over from scratch.

513710	2	0	officialkillah	486	2	1	38.1	September 3	 201	Scum is a blast. I'll start by saying that. There are a lot of bad reviews coming out and I feel like it has to do with the confusion of the style of game. It is closer to a hardcore survival game and less of a PVP game. There are PVP elements as well as PVE though.  Ive boxed a gun out of someones hand to get the kill and also died from lack of food. Playing with a group of friends is a blast and ducking bullets from the guard robots can really get the blood pumping. This game has a lot of potential and I suggest picking it up and giving it a try.
513710	1	0	wolfingbydayz	33	3	1	31.4	September 3	 201	Fun. Really annoying when you die and have no FP but once you get into it it’s not that hard to get a lot of FP. Hard to learn at first but gets easier.

Even in early access it feels like everything DayZ wanted to be	 with a little bit of a Miscreated and even some Rust vibes. At times it even reminds me of Project Zomboid. Kind of a steep learning curve	 but that's kind of part of the appeal for a hardcore game like this. The netcode is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right now	 which can make PVP feel clunky	 so I'll be looking forward to that getting fixed up. Updates have been steady and well communicated. So far so good. Was worth the asking price	 in my opinion	 and it's not done yet."

Physical character customization is pretty basic. Can only be male	 have a few pre-set head shapes and faces	 can make your character skinny	 muscular	 or fat	 or anything in between. Although the physical aspect of your character is basic	 the soft stats are very detailed. When creating your character you can specify what he specializes in by assigning attribute points	 (melee combat	 stealth	 scavenging	 rifles	 and much more...) All these (obviously) determine how your character performs.The game is focused on long-term survival and character management in a very	 very large map. Loot scarcity is pretty realistic. If you're scavenging small	 abandoned towns you're not likely to find very much of consequence. Various small items like scissors	 scrap	 can or two of food	 etc. Whereas if you travel into a military area you'll find much more interesting things.It's very fun	 even for $20 early access game. I'd recommend it if you've been waiting a game like Day Z that isn't garbage."

I cant say that I would recommend it after our experience.Gameplay drops off like a cliff as soon as you get gear it seems. Finding other people to PvP with is like searching for a needle in a haystack and then the experience is usually lack luster for both parties.This game has tons of bugs	 and terrible user interface choices. Figuring out why you are slowly dying should not be so difficult. Determining what sources of food provides which required nutrients should also not be so hard	 we found wildly disproportionate values for food items. Using items should be consistent	 we found wildly divergent user experiences with the same items and item types	 opening cans and starting fires was the big area that we found extremely frustrating	 but other areas were also terrible."

Some random thoughts and impressions playing the game the price is affordable great for purchasing with group of friends. Its price will go up with more contents so best to get earlier and support them! The devs told all feedbacks and suggestions will be listened to and if more people want those feature they will consider and prioritize on adding.you have to make a new character when joining a different server. If you don't like the current saved character you can make a new one or continue current one in the server. Also	 when you log out it's not like Rust or Ark where the body stays where you left but will be safe by being looted and not in the world until you play again.need the server to be more stable I still see most server ping as 999	 not sure if I have joined low ping or high ping. When it was just released my friend and I got disconnected often so was planning on playing after the fix. (My friend played in a server for 9 hours straight today without being disconnected or kicked so that is the quick fix you guys did there!)can't join your friend by Steam or get invited to the server so you have to let your friends know the server name. Seems like later update you might be able to know which server your friends are in because there are friends tab on the server list.there is First and Third Person perspective which is great!when you die you have to spend fame points to revive. You can spawn with different options : Random (25 FP) / Sector (50 FP) / At Shelter (75FP) / On Squadmate (100 FP)You lose everything you have except default items.for early access and new release	 this game is impressive and promising. There are many things to do unlike the game Survive the Nights which was like a walking simulator slow updates and anticipating features not really implemented.helpful metabolism meter like Arma 3 - Altis Life or The Sims. Very immersive so you try to stay fit	 prepare to not dehydrate	 starve or get infected. Running a lot or doing heavy actions can reduce stamina and tire you out. I believe you can diagnose and treat by pressing tab too.I got lost trying to find my friend who joined the group. I wish it is easier to find them and also show the point on the map where they are.if you like nature with many trees and birds chippering this is for you!many things to salvage (however some are empty so takes time to find)you can poop (It's possible to poop without having to take off your pants or underwear and the poop magically disappears)	 pee (you can pee in 360 degrees turn	 vomit (in case you have eaten poisonous mushrooms or spoiled food vomit away xD). Funny thing is you can't use the toilet but can do actions above anywhere you desire.I like that this game doesn't have a restricted zone like PUBG. I can relax	 horde and loot without any pressure to get in the zone :D (Except when you get caught and get stabbed or shot by a player)being able to craft with materials and also cook by gathering ingredientsI like being able to control the pace of walking	 jogging	 and running. (However when I'm being attacked by zombies sometimes I forget to scroll and walk instead of running)I wish you can know where you died on the map like ark survival evolved so you can at least retrieve some items that are leftneed some optimization. I set to mine the lowest but still laggy when I'm in town or have to process the area.zombies are pretty fast so I get bitten easily when melee attack but this could be that I don't have a better weapon. Suggestions or Ideas If there is SCUM based Main story to play where you can focus on in singleplayer or co-op it would be awesome!Need the town to be a bit lively because it is a ghost town and no one is around except other players who want to kill you for loots. Stray animals that roam around (so you can catch or kill them for resources) and some relocating NPCs you can interact that don't stay at one place like a rare trader or quest giver.Faction or community you can join such as civilian or looter base like the game Next Day.pvp is great but would be cool to see pve versionWould be great if there is an option for borderless windowBeing able to have skilled based professions would be interestingTown or base where you can save items and marketplace where you can trade or sell things. Also	 the area is a safe zone so you don't get killed by camping players. being able to build underground or land base where your group of friends can locate from the map. I wish you can stock all the foods and equipment just like the planned feature from the game Survive The Nights.more animals to hunt and fishI wish there is a server option without zombies having four seasons and having to prepare before winter comes would be cool!being able to farm and grow crops and take care of animals. Would be great to make my own cheese	 gather eggs and milk and use collected feces for fertilizer like Ark Survival Evolved.I wish just like 7 days to die if you put on certain inventory slot it stays with you even when you die. It sucks to lose everything :(I really believe this game will be polished and not be a letdown :) If they really meant what they say on the early access description	 making sure all our voices are heard	 it could possibly be one of the most played with the awesome community :)“Gamepires encourages the community to post their comments	 ideas	 feature requests and bug reports directly on Steam’s discussion pages	 official game dev blog or even third party sites (Reddit	 Wiki	 etc...). All posts	 suggestions and ideas will be closely examined by our community managers and they will give their best to respond to each and every post you make.

513710	0	0	76561198018811171	480	16	-1	3.5	August 30	 201	The major flaws SCUM faces at the moment:1) 64 players is not enough for how massive the map is. 2) Spawns. You can't squad up with your mates before the game starts. You have to meet with one another once the game starts.3) Memory leak. The longer the match goes on the more your fps diminishes. You have to log back in every 30min to get good fps again.For $20 SCUM is insanely worth it once these three issues are fixed. The map is beautiful and the game is full of detail. Animations and physics are very good. The connection is impressively solid. I can see all the animations my mates are doing. The game feels in sync with other players and items dropped.

This is SCUM A Mixed Survival/PVP game where your worst criminals come to try and survival on an island. You can bring companions or a ""Squad"" with you if you wish to play with your friends. You can also choose to make friends or lose friends here. This is a game with a Hardcore Survival aspect. You will have Sodium/Sugar/Energy levels just about anything you can think of. You will have heartbeats that will keep your heart going a mile a minute while playing. This game is just insane	 yes I've gone through some bad bugs where I've lost fully kitted weapons multiple times but that's Early Access for you. I'm not going to belittle a Dev Team of only 17 people while Dayz prances around with their 300 and somehow manage to compare the 2 together. No.This game is a must play	 but you better be open to things like bugs because every game will have them."

Great game so far	 just scratching the surface of the giant open world	 expect to log the hours that will give me my $20 of entertainment by far."

Bland and boring	 was excited to play all day and after playing over an hour	 I was honestly falling asleep.. nothing exciting about this	 it's average and I'd give it a 5/10 because of how well it runs and the mechanics are nice. Refunded"

Although it is a bit of a mess at the launch	 that is to be anticipated with every launch day early access game. Cretins that write negative reviews keep forgetting that it is indeed early access.So far what i have seen has not disappointed one bit. This game is what dayZ could and should have been. And its way cheaper than any ""competition"" out there offering similar gameplay.No reason not to buy this if as the devs have an outstanding reputation with previous games."

One big downside is how hard it is to play with friends I had 4 friends in a lobby tonight we played for probably 3 hours and not once were we all together because one of us would spawn so far away and by the time the got there one of us would die and so on. It’s also a pain to try and get in the game as the servers are inconsistent. The addition of vehicles would improve this game dramatically

For people that like challenging games and the sense of consequence SCUM is definatley worth your consideration. Upon release its a great balance of systems. They are easy to pickup but deep enough to spend some serious time developing a deep understanding. Much like Dark Souls	 this game tosses you in. You will die. a lot. Unlike Dark Souls	 you figure out what you want to do. As far as your playstyle	 there is no wrong answer. If the idea of being a ruthless killer makes you stiff... go for it. Hop into a match with your buddy	 and grind out your saturday? Feel free. Maybe the concept of wreaking psycological havok to overly trusting team mates is your style... that works too. Maybe you are a If you are a wandering sage-like buddhist that wants to help every player you meet. You can do that too. Literally anything goes here. As the game develops and features are added	 the cost goes up. So if you are into difficult games with an overwhelming sense of gratification then SCUM is great option. If you are looking for a new PUBG or Fortnite - Pass this up."

Unlike Dark Souls	 you figure out what you want to do. As far as your playstyle	 there is no wrong answer. If the idea of being a ruthless killer makes you stiff... go for it. Hop into a match with your buddy	 and grind out your saturday? Feel free. Maybe the concept of wreaking psycological havok to overly trusting team mates is your style... that works too. Maybe you are a If you are a wandering sage-like buddhist that wants to help every player you meet. You can do that too. Literally anything goes here. As the game develops and features are added	 the cost goes up. So if you are into difficult games with an overwhelming sense of gratification then SCUM is great option. If you are looking for a new PUBG or Fortnite - Pass this up."

Scum is only in alpha and it surpasses many of the survival games that have been out for quite sometime. The developers are working hard to make this into an even better game by adding many things to come. I would highly recommend this game.

First off the zomebies don't walk right through the walls for the first 2 years of release. Good job guys you did a better job then DAYZ did on day one. I like how the game works. Animations could use a bit improving with throwing spears but that's no big. The stat and skill system is very cool and i'm enjoying it. graphically looks good for the map size although there is a big of drop in where building just show up in the distance so depth of field needs a little work. I usually go critical on games that don't have good hit registry but i haven't had a single problem with that yet	 either against zombies or other players. I feel as thought when you're picking up ammo though	 it should auto stack	 because i would obviously do that in real life. I've had a few issues with close combat lagginess but nothing that will discourage me from playing cause i'm sure it will get fixed. Overall great game. You guys are doing a good job with your release and i'm really looking forward to seeing where the game goes from here."

I bought DayZ about 3 weeks ago and it was a waste of my time and money (that is putting it nicely).

Devs - take some hints from Rust or PUBG - this does not have to be such a tedious boring mechanic-no way to start off with friends - very long walk to meet up with them-you can make a group only when you meet	 but if you want to respawn near each other	 you need FP - which you probably don't have. Walking for ages just to play with friends is not fun.-LAG Tried a few servers	 my own motion was OK - but other players were teleporting around 20 meters at a time	 making combat completly unplayableOn the good side - I like the complex character system	 graphics look sweet	 and combat may be good if not laggier than a north korean server in the 90sI actually asked for a refund	 but it was declined do to 3.9hrs of playtime. 1hr was fighting with the server browser	 and at least 2 more were hiking to meet a friend and lagging all over the shop.Sorry to leave a bad review - DEVS - please implement steam sessions and upgrade/fix server browser functionality (sorting+filtering!)I assume lag issues are not universal	 and are being worked on already.Will update this review after a few patches!

One of the best graphics in a survival and open world game! 11/10If you are considering to buy this game	 here is my point of view:1) If you are buying this game for PVP	 as for my experience	 you gotta have the interest in exploring and stacking up your resources before you even PVP because of the different survival fundamentals like food.2) If you like stealth type of game	 this is really the one you would want to try. Try being stealthy against the Sentry Machines on military bases!3) If you are buying this for a survival game	 this is the one! This is the best survival game I would recommend to anyone!4) You would really need basic knowledge of Food and Nutritions if they really gonna be strict with the nutritionsThings that i'm suggesting that can be fixed (for the devs) : 1) There's a spot in Military Base at B1 where you can be stuck	 near the ladders that is also accessible but couldn't go through it completely.2) Saturation and Gamma settings	 I'm not sure if its me but I find it could be abit dull and too dark	 and for people who prefer rich in colours	 these settings would be a plus one!"

After playing for awhile	 I can say that there isn't a load of content yet	 there's performance issues after the game plays for awhile (sometimes massive perfomance issues)	 problems with losing connection to the server you're on	 character wipes have already happened twice since I personaly bought it	 and there are various bugs	 especially relating to the puppets (the zombies). That said	 god DAMN this game has a strong	 if rudimentary	 foundation. I personally really enjoy the in-depth metabolism system. It makes the actual survival aspect a lot more fun for me personally. With the small updates coming fast so far	 I'm going to stick with this game as long as the devs do too. If survival is your thing	 put this on your wishlist. If survival is REALLY your thing	 then seriously consider buying this. I don't recommend you come here with the mentality of ""I'll try it out for two hours and refund it if I don't like it"". It took me longer than that to really get a feel and grasp of everything on a basic level. But if you want to do that	 you do you Boo Boo. All in all	 I'm really enjoying this game so far and I really hope it gets less shallow. I can only walk around the woods and towns for so long without true purpose. Thumbs up"

If you liked Arma & DayZ	 this game is for you.It's price point is more than fair. Dont expect a fast paced PUBG type of game. Very immersive game with hilarious encounters that is well backed by its responsive devs.Best buy in a while for me!"

They have already implimented anti cheat	 just a few days after reports of hackers. Bug tweaks every couple days as well	 along with server optimaztion and game client optimaztion. The game looks beautiful	 and runs pretty well. A few dropped frames and stutters here and there but not anything to bad	 hopefully will be fixed in the next few patches. Lots of content in the game	 a huge map	 good variation of guns	 and melee weapons	 a simple crafting system that is well is well thought out and easily expandable	 plus did i mention the game looks great! :)My overall opinion is that the game isnt flawless but with the devs activally listening and making changes	 I can see this game having a really bright future."

While they have piles of little issues to work out	 the game is more than playable and it's super addicting. Not sure what else to say	 I'm glad to be along for this ride as they improve and expand the game. The game world is HUGE	 and since 64 people per server you don't run into people all that often. So it is more laid back exploring and killing puppets (zombies) with some pvp here and there. It's easy enough to just run away if you don't want to pvp as well. Or you can just play solo. I would imagine some people will put up roleplay PvE only servers at some point as well. Right now it's a perfect mix	 IMO. I love the crafting of items and searching around for that one last thing you need to do something else."

Spent around 17 hours on it so far	 the map is huge and absolutely gorgeous	 the details are amazing. The game's only danger doesn't come from players you have puppets and mechs to deal with but your greatest enemy often is yourself. You have to monitor your health	 even calory intakes and vitamins	 metabolism plays a key role and is not as trivial as most similar games. Sure you have to take care of your negative status but it can be complicated at times. For example	 you might be thinking that you're eating enough but your energy isn't refilling at closer look at your health monitor screen you might see that your Vitamin D is very low	 and even though you are eating enough food	 not all the food offer the same calories or vitamins	 it took me a while to realize the best source of vitamin D intake is kind of brown mushroom that I missed a lot in my explorations. There of course issues with the game too like	 running out of video memory even though you might have a graphics card with more than 8GB of memory	 these things will be fixed in time. I'm not gonna try and force a comparison	 but I played a lot of Sandbox Survival games and so far SCUM is my favorite	 it has so much potential with Devs who are active and interact often with the community and take their feedback into account. I'm really looking forward to the story missions implementation as I have always believed a good Survival game should have things more than players locked into an unending battle over fame and resources."

The game has some creative and unique elements however this is over shadowed by the lack of end game	 basically once you have a gun and good loot there is nothing to do but run around looking for people who are worse off than you. There is no way to win anything but periodic satisfaction after destroying the occasional zombie horde. On top of it all this game performs so poorly on my system that even the menu gave me 30fps. If this was a beta and not a $20.00 Game my review would be more forgiving. However in it's current state this is worth no more than $5.00."

You can't see NPC/players that you can't see in 1st.....'how bout that.  The 3rd person cheaters won't be able to see you around the corner or over the wall anymore.  Funny how those who claim using 3rd person didn't didn't help as an advantage or didn't use it for that are now crying about not having the advantage.We'll have to see how the leveling system works in MP.  They never have very well.  Any dev with any knowledge of survival games should understand what that is.  Survival.....not giving someone an advantage....that's a cheat.   In a survival game you bring what you have to the table.  Your skill increases as you play not arbitrarily with freaking levels.....it's stupid.  But...... the may have made it where it actually will negate some issues and not give the advantage we think it will.  Just wait and see. I bought the game for the SP aspect only.   Which is currently non playable due to no persistence.   The devs failed to notice they have no means to allow SP characters to save their progress.......pretty lame start for the SP experience. What is good is well thought out	 but needs refinement	 like inventory managment	 and crafting.  How you use items is overly complicated	 and both crafting and inventory use are not very intuitive.  The management aspect is where you have many choices...  Place an item directly on to a table/shelf/floor from the inv. window and vis versa. Performance will vary.  Those with with new CPUs and GTX 1070s or higher will see 60fps on average @ epic preset.  The only Unreal engine based ea release that actually performs well IMO.  Ark still has horrible fps years later and I'm getting 70+ in SCUM."

It is in early acces at the moment so when thinking of buying it dont go in with huge expectations and tinking it'll have lots of content. It can feel very bare bones at times on your own so I recommend finding someone to play with. All in all though I have enjoyed the game so far and im excited to see where the game will go with time.

Here is my scummy story As me and my 2 friends met up after a lonely lord of the rings journey from across the map we couldnt be more happy to have met up with eachother at the farm in the middle of no where. My two friends found an egg each to eat. I did not. This egg was discovered to have a magical bug that made it never disappear. (Now fixed) for 3 hours every time my buddys ate this magical egg I had to hear about how amazing it was. How lucky they are. How I'm a piece of s**** because I dont have a magical egg.... as I'm sure you can tell.... man was I sad. But i realized right before we decided to clear out some zombies in front of a town. Wait.... this is a survival simulator. Eating an egg constantly for hours cant be good for your health... "" hey boys.... the egg is cool and all but you may want to check your stats"" (zombies getting closer) friend 1 ""omg my sodium level is 1000%""Friend 2 ""wait mine is to!""

LITTERALLY SPRAYING liquid s**** with force out of there a**. Never have I seen anything like this in my life. We all died laughing... and I mean actually died in game.  The moral of the story is. First off.... dont only eat eggs. You will s*** yourself. Second is yes in EA there is bugs. Some more annoying then others. But the dev's pump the patches out. And this game is what you make it. Go out. Go on an adventure. And let game unfold. Its 100% worth the money just for watching my a**hole friends crap there pants. Give it a buy.

Some reviewers say to ignore the reviews from people with only a couple hours into the game	 but I honestly feel 2 hours is enough time to determine whether or not you're going to enjoy this game. Compared the DayZ...this game destroys DayZ in my opinion	 having played both. If you have friends to play this with	 I think it'd be a lot of fun running with someone else. Play it solo and for me	 I got bored quick. There's no real objective (even in early access) other than to loot and maybe do a little crafting	 that's it. You're managing a metabolism mechanic which is actually pretty cool	 but it felt a little over the top to have to manage all of that. Every time I opened that view	 I cared less and less about managing it. The game is multiplayer	 but the map is so big that it seems rather hard to cross anyone else unless you're playing for hours and hours. For me	 I got bored running so far between anything that's lootable	 getting there	 and then not finding squat only to find another town on the map and run to that one. Feels a lot like a graphically beautiful running simulator with the ability to loot. I'm not knocking the game. I think it has a lot of potential. If I could give it a neutral rating	 I would. I'm just saying for me after a couple hours of running around	 I got bored and couldn't see myself actively playing this over other games right now. So I requested a refund and re-added the game to my wishlist to track its future progress down the road."

I also think they should add some more PVE options against some military personal. I get a solid 70 to 80 fps on epic with my system (gtx 1070	 i5 6700k and 16 GB Ram).  I really don’t understand most of the negative reviews its an early access game and it takes more then 2 hours to start understanding this game. They also seem to have fixed the 999 ping bug by replacing it with a loading icon."

So far I've really enjoyed the gameplay and the fact this game acctually has an sp mode. A very interesting take on the survival genre with it's intense focus on biological aspects that drive the character depending on what you do	 eat	 drink or take that dump or not. To really see your character put on weight as you eat fat and thus realise you are not able to run as long or fast as before is acctually an very fun aspect	 until you realise that the zombies will catch you after this... Oh well	 god lord that zombie fat tastes so good :)"

It's a great game but has a few minor bugs/things they could nerf and patch.Had to restart on a glitch where I was stuck in my ""Mending Wound"" animation	 healing myself.The other only issue is massive hitching when entering newer areas because of how unoptimized some of it's options are	 some only allowing the lowest you can set them to as ""Medium"" meaning even it's current ""System Requirements"" could change over time with patches/updates allowing users with weaker PCs to run it on Low when it's available.Aside that the Stamina for running is absurdly impalanced with how much walking you need to do in less resource abundant areas leaving you having to either walk at a snail's pace or stand still for a minute til your stamina refills.Outside personal complaints and a simple if not rare bug	 the game is a lot of fun from what i've experienced of it's Single Player Mode.I definitely suggest it if you don't mind a game that came out just this week that'll likely be patched like mad over the next month to improve it."

The run and gun youth can't see the potential in this game you must be mad. Events	 Modding	 in game senario's that will be able to be created for fun is going to be massive	 once the game is available for Dedicated servers and decent admin tools it will get much better	 then modding will take it to another level	 but you'll need to wait for a year or so for this to happen.Dev's however should start to think about adding Content to the game	 Missions	 Roaming AI armed e.g. merc's	 in the next short period to give the game the boost.Server owner who have bought into Scum I feel have been let down a bit	 G-Portal and Dev's should of really had some decent quality tools in place before the game was released	 they released the game without admin tools was only going to get punished by the community a bit. So saying that they have produced some admin tools	 basic one's	 logging is poor if non-existent and in game player info e.g. non-admin players can only see active in game player count if the leave the server look at the server browser go back in or ask an admin on player count. Dev's you need to focus on this	 can't run servers blind.Admin tools for player specate	 spawn to locations to setup self made events are near impossible	 god mode does not exist	 so you make an event	 then get killed by the e.g. Zombie	 bear or sentry you are spawning in	 then have to run back to location as teleport to location has been removed.So the game is good	 graphics is good	 content is a let down	 but I suspect it will get good over a period of months	 just need to hang in there guys."

The gameplay is smooth	 the controls take maybe 30 minutes to get used to	 5 minutes if you've played Escape from Tarkov. The Devs are active on Reddit and the steam forums	 in most cases you get close to instant feedback. The bugs that have been reported in the first week of release have been patched and they're still working hard to fix any that pop up. In the first week of release they've pushed out 5 patches.I run a 1080 FE 8gb	 an i5 7600k No OC and 16gb ram (1080p). I hover around 110 fps and occasionally dip in gunfights and mech fights. Gaming on a 144hz monitor really helps you notice those fps drops	 it's a blessing and a curse. Even playing solo	 it's thrilling. Running into a small horde of puppets	 raiding the airfield/factory/etc.	 running into other players. Right now	 if you're shot dead	 you respawn with nothing. But it takes 10 minutes to be fully geared if you go by the airfield or large town that has a police station. There is no base building right now	 but you can build ""shelters"" that act as spawn points. You can also build small wood boxes	 but anyone can loot them at the moment. Really	 it's just something you should use to store starting gear next to your shelter so you don't have to craft a stone knife and work your way up. Or you can hide them as best as you can	 and hope no one finds the loot you stored. This is just a place holder for now	 so if it's not something you're comfortable with	 then hold off and wait until they finish it.There's also a TDM event in each server	 haven't tried it myself but heard from everyone that it's a great way to learn the weapons in the game and have fun."

It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.

Very poor optimization.  - There are tabs in the server browser called ""Favorites""	 ""Recently played"" etc. The servers you recently played on doesnt show up in the ""Recently played"" tab	 and there is no obvious way to add a server to favorites	 so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.Stay far away from this game until these issues have been adressed."

DC is a issue right now but doesnt happen	 honestly im really enjoying this game right now the combat is fun the looting is what you would expect i cant wait to see what happens with this game in 1 months time."

513710	5	1	SCTofficial	14	1	1	8.8	August 30	 201	"with the fact it is still EARLY ACCESS (all the negatives seem to have forgotten this) its a fantastic concept the graphics at this stage in the games life are superb	 sure there are issues that need ironing out like the servers but yesterday on release day they where slammed with people	 the lag issues and memory leakage thats casing a few issues are an easy fix same for the low levels of loot available at this stage... in round uplots of minor issues nothing major fantastic concept looking forward to playing the game as it grows to a completed game"
513710	20	0	76561197985059717	179	1	-1	1.8	August 30	 201	Game is fun for looting but garbage for the actual shooter mechanic. It runs pretty well until you see other players. They lag around the server so you can´t shoot them. Winning a firefight is actually just pure luck. After this happened to me for the third time I just refunded.
513710	5	0	Spongebeeeb	250	8	1	7.0	August 30	 201	"So far so good	 the game needs some fixing but nothing major as far as Im concerned.Im playing with:i7700K OC to 4.8ghzGTX 980ti16gb of RAMI have everything set to the highest and I very rarely get lag. It pretty much runs smoothly at all times."

Runs better than DayZ standalone ever did or ever will. The Good: +UE4 modern game engine	 it looks & runs great+Interesting & unique mechanics (metabolism	 skill-based points system	 fame	 high risk/reward loot areas)+On Demand PVP arenas (optional)+Active devs	 Day 1 patch+Intuitive crafting+Loot spawn in a happy medium (much less than Battle Royale-type games	 more than other DayZ-type games)+Story clearly planned out and is noticeable in game+Does not hold your hand whatsoever	 but is intuitive enough to figure out on your own+You can absolutely spend 0 time looting if you wanted and just survive in the wilderness and I think that's great The Bad:-Minor server side issues (not nearly as bad as some are suggesting)-No game breaking bugs on Day 1-Some minor quirks that let on it's EA-Could use optimization-Melee is a bit wonky	 but you learn the quirks quickly-Does not play nice with two monitors right now (esp. with different or ultrawide resolutions) I've seen both the good and bad sides of early access titles. The dev team is active and cares about making a good game. Despite what a lot of people are saying	 this is a great starting point."

513710	3	1	Qtzirl	148	3	-1	13.5	August 30	 201	"To make a quick buck they sold all of their players out and signed an exclusive server deal with an absolutely terrible provider.  Which means that although you may be able to host a server that far out performs theirs	 you wont be able to	 ever.  They claim that its ""not set in stone"" because its really set in paper.  For me that nails the coffin shut on this super laggy	 lack of playable depth	 early access Dayz remake."

The metabolism chart is something I gotta learn more about	 the game is laggy on my end(I have a GTX 680	 something like that	 and an old CPU	 but enough RAM and what not)	 and I expect later on for the devs to make it more optimized.The majority of people complaining expected this to be an AAA game once it came out	 but right before you start playing	 they let you know that the game is in Alpha	 meaning there's tons of bugs	 and there's tons of things that need to get worked on	 and will get worked on. I've seen someone complain about ""having to pay for servers"" to play	 you don't have to pay for a server to play	 you can play single player if you'd like	 or you can join another persons server	 clearly you've never played DayZ(a game with no single player	 and you either pay 30$ for a server	 or play on anothers	 it's nothing new	 and this person is clearly just looking for something to complain about).Others were expecting there to be no bugs	 and were expecting there to be boat loads of content	 but the devs shouldn't have to remind people that it's in Alpha so many times	 the game is even shown as Early Access	 and people were expecting the game to be like fortnite(or some other game that had loads of content right off the bat	 y'know	 a bigger company whos game that isn't in Alpha).TL;DRThe game is good	 it's in alpha	 the majority of people complaining thought it was an AAA game loaded with tons of content	 they over hyped it themselves	 and are now salty about it	 and should probably research what it means when games are in alpha."

Combat is terrible.The loot spawns	 not bad	 just don't expect to find a gun with ammo next to it. Also if you do manage to find a gun with the right ammo	 you will probably have to find a clip to put the ammo in first so uhh. Good luck."

513710	0	0	CRACKIN_HEADS	64	6	1	34.8	August 30	 201	So the game is good but some lag here and there not to bad.... They need to add more loot!! To many things out there that want to hurt you!!
