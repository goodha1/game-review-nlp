label	review
1	 the developer just need to ramp up their game now they have a lot of fans.Don't leave us hanging like DayZ standalone."
1	"""PRINTEDCHEATS.CO.UK""   he is teleporting around the map and killing people someone please ban this dude"
1	 Experince is your best weapon!"
1	gud
1	 and devs are super on top of things!"
-1	game bad
1	Ok game. Going to play it again next year.
1	It ight
-1	 im not going to do that in a game.REFUND/10"
1	 once the desync issues are sorted this will be a 10/10 game."
-1	 and scarce amounts of information online from what I can tell. Frustrating experience overall but I'm optimistic that the developers can continue fixing this game."
1	Dayz but good.
1	 there's nothing we can do much in the game instead of learning new other stuff Need more optimization + Game FeaturesMaybe Add Some Vehicle + Or Maybe Base ? ( so we can store our items)"
1	LOVE THE GAME!! I would recomend the team to make more stuff to build. maybe a bigger shelter or even like your own house. I have got 3 of my friends to buy the game!
1	 if your not into survival sims and expecting BR or heavily PVP focused game then your not going to enjoy. It's a shame a lot of the streamers who got early access weren't the type of streamers that play these types of games regularly as set some false expectations in my personal opinion anyway"
1	just started but this is ***** / *****
1	- Looted for 3 hours. - 2 people approached me and told me they are frienldy. - They told me i can take a dump and they will protect me. - I trusted them. - As soon as i started to take a dump they killed me and stole all my items.   10/10 would trust again.
1	Early days of the game but I think give it time and this could be up there with some of the best if the devs listen to the community.
-1	 but these are things that should have been fixed before beta release"
-1	 crafting and the complicated metabolism stuff seem like fun but I guess that is a skill most big streamers have hype as to be honest it is all pretty crappy. The complicated parts are just stupidly complicated for no reason. There's no loot anyway. It's badly optimized. Also the graphics may be sharp but there is no atmosphere etc. If you want a good OWS then go for Miscreated or The Forest or something."
1	This is the game DayZ was supposed to be all those years ago.Loving it!
1	 just trying to even the reviews against people who are complaining about ghetty things that don't have anything to do with the game itself"
1	Finally a game where I can poop on the people I kill. 10/10. Teabagging will never feel the same again.
1	 you are going to get yourself drowned if you try to swim fully geared. Heavy rain also tends to slow your movement if you go on without a raincoat and get soaked.And for me i just enjoy it when i can urinate and poop on the dead bodies of my enemies9/10 and will be 10/10 after the FPS issues have been fixed! :)Cheers~!"
-1	 then die and start over"
-1	 but only if you're new to this type of game"
1	Open world realistic survial! if you like this style game put this one on your wish list!
-1	 i'm not recommending playing this game."
-1	not intrested
1	What an amazing game. Can't wait for better FPS!!!!!!
1	grapchis etc."
-1	Why is this game such a trash?
-1	 very far from a game. No idea behind the gameplay yet. Just another DayZ rip-off with some additional character parameters."
-1	 if it ever comes out of early access I'll gladly pay full price but until then there are just too many other optons on Steam."
1	Connection lost!
-1	 now let's actually see some hard work to actually prove that it can be reached."
1	 has potential."
-1	 but it adds nothing but an anoyance to the gameplay.if you wanna buy a game and are trying to figure out between DAYZ and this... buy this... if you have DAYZ.. dont buy this"
-1	Refunded
-1	 but if you want that go play Dayz."
-1	 it's just more of a social game and if you don't have people to play with it's not worth the time and the money."
1	 wait for it to jump in price. Or wait for more content to come."
-1	 the game is so realistic!) Then you're good to go to the Airport and PvP or simply wait around at your camp until another player shoots you."
-1	 it is not for co-op"
1	 if you're going solo prepare for the good old KOS that comes with all survival games. I really hope they can add Random events that happen around the map that involes PvE fighting and rewards with good loot."
1	 this baby's a DayZ killer."
1	Dayz is definitely dead now
1	 hoping combat is improved further its not terrible now"
-1	I was going to refund this game but I got so bored I fell asleep for 3 hours now I can't refund it. 2/5
1	 peace!"
1	Games has potential. If you can't deal with early access bugs right now; wait. I've enjoyed it for now and hope the devs can handle the hackers and desync.
1	How do i get a squadmate
-1	This single handedly the worse gmae I've ever played. Does not feel finished and lacks a lot of key components.
-1	 the game looks good and it is a cool world."
1	Needs work still fun
1	10/10
1	GAME OF THE YEAR
-1	Day 1 : couldnt play on any OF servers bc they were down (whatever thats cool ill mess around in solo player and play tomorrow.) Day 2: still down for all day so i come back to it at night. Log in to an official server and after 2 mins in game get killed by a hacker 6 times in a row all random spawns all right after spawning..... is there really no anticheat? I can't believe game developers have not learned yet. 2 GOLDEN RULES FOR EARLY ACCESS: 1. Your players will do everything you dont think they will be able to do faster than you dont think they will be able to do it. 2. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HACK YOUR GAME. HAVE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM IN PLACE TO STOP IT AND REPORT IT.I can't test your game if I can't play your game.
-1	 boom. He killed me 10 seconds later. Great. Lost everything. Second game- I finally started to get the hang of it and enjoyed it more but then was head shot by a random hacker and lost everything. The game lags so badly that it's had to even (not that I even had a gun) shoot at a player because players and animals lag around. If I was given this game for free I wouldn't even play it at the state it's in. Luckily I was able to get my refund because this game advertises ""Coop"" Multiplayer when in fact it is clearly not."
-1	Not what I expected. Was looking for a game to replace Just Survive. Its not the same. Kind of makes me sad. The hype for this game was through the roof. Maybe after game imprtoves and building is added ill give it a try again but I am rewuesting a refund til then.
1	Nice game.
1	Best Early Access Game
1	 except on day two of release there is already hackers speed running around one shotting you through the ground. that is the developers biggest hurdle now."
1	 and is plenty of fun already."
1	 making mechs slower/turn slower would have been a better nerf in my opinion.all in all i think $20 is a fair price for this survival EA game as it's great if you like running around looting with the occasional player interaction and the option to play some event gamemodes (although respawns need improving)soz grammar nazis I cbf checking this."
1	I am new to pc gaming (lifelong console gamer) and have only played for a little while on single player. I really enjoy the survival and crafting elements. Due to having an old computer this game is hard to run and lags quite a bit so until that gets fixed with a new computer and game patches I will have to wait to play multiplayer.
-1	No bueno.
-1	ITS CRAP
1	 PUBG.Storyline - Doesnt exist really . Your scum in a massive prison and you have to survive thats it.Depth - Not huge it is trying to be to many games. I think it wants to be PUBG for adults.Crafting - minimal basically what you carry and a dodgy little campsiteAt $20 its worth getting and it still has some alpha issues like focus points disappearing in single player.Be aware it has an insane in depth health system that you need a degree or phd to understand in short cokked is best many ingrediants also the best."
-1	 and im still let down."
1	"waited so long for this so i'm ok with any issues1st day join a discord scum group.20 of us on fresh server.setup base after all being noobs and finally getting a fire goingTag teaming zombies and running around waiving their dead dead body partsMan shows up dressed as a Bear he skinned (MR.BADDASS)I pooped out a banana from my ""prison pocket"" (this perk is in the paid DLC plus other things)A team mate peed on a deerJump into event mode 5 minute fun in PVP land ( Had to lower GFX settings for FPS)Beautiful to look at even on a ancient R290 Gfx card8.5 / 10 worth $20 (+$8 for the DLC)Thank you devs"
1	good
1	 run around and die a bunch with no end gamewait till something endgame comes"
-1	I refunded due to hackers.
1	 the effort that has gone into to released content is shaping up to be a great precursor for the direction and quality of the overall game and I think that is one BIG detail people have mostly overlooked.I wholeheartedly recommend backing this game in early access."
1	It's the new Dayz but way better and Already running much better. With in a week of the game being out they already patched gaming breaking bugs. I suggest getting it while its 20$
-1	TRASHHHHHHHHH
1	[7/10]finally... you can take a dump in the game.
1	 SCUM is basically undefeatable."
1	 unless they patch in a rocket launcher at some point.Buy this game."
1	It's funny how most of the bad reviews are written by people who spent more time writing the review than actually playing the game.
-1	 hoping an upgrade will change my mindno point giving my opinion yet"
-1	 as for now i have no way to recommend it"
-1	SCUM more like SCAM!
-1	 But Been more than 2 hrs I wanted to give a real try. Right know Waste of time!!!"
1	 but the very active Devs have fixed that. Overall a very enjoyable game."
1	Best Survival game.
1	 atleast it feels like that).Can't wait for fixes (and bigger hordes and cool random events)."
1	 especially that most are due to LAG or Perfomance. Its time to Upgrade your machine bro. Moreover its early access and its all ready more enjoyable than Dayz Misscreated and H1Z1.The future additions to this game look bright. and its well priced. worth every penny."
-1	Hot garbage even for beta.
1	 there are some severe memory leak issues that needs to be addressed in a timely manner and i have no doubts that they will be. After following this game for the better part of two years i can honestly and happily say that it has lived up to its hype and I look forward for what the future holds ofr Scum."
1	So far so good :)
1	 it's poorly playable and are only for those who doesn't care to face many bugs and a raw game. For those who demands a game with a minimum playable capability = Wait a little further or get it with a discount. For tose who loves realism and are very commited to the idea despite the bugs and rawness = Get it."
1	 which is nice.Im looking forward to keep an eye on this game."
1	Needs Some optimalization but for EA i think its a pretty good gameFor me it was worth the money
1	 and actually go search you should be fine. i have engaged every person i have encountered except one or two fresh spawns and the gunplay is pretty decent.  needs a little bit of tweaking probably but it is much better than rust imo.  i have also caught a few shots when i wasn't expecting them and turned the fight to my favor.  the shots to kill varies i assume but it usually feels right.  have not emptied a mag just to be looked at and shot.   im very hopefull the devs deliver on all their promises because this will be the survival winner once that's done."
1	 but time would say."
-1	this is just survive with better graphics i  run around for about an hour with a shot gun an a pistol with no ammo starving and bored refud request all ready sent
1	Yes it has a few problems it's just came out but already in a better place than Dayz. Just think what this will become.
1	 and enjoying it!"
1	A lot more polished than Day z. This game is actually fun. Awesome visuals too! The devs seem to be doing what they said and keeping up with the community. Totally worth the $20.
1	Ive been enjoying this game with hardly any issues other than fps dips
1	 the game is well optimized relative to other EA survival games."
-1	 but you cant go outside because the robots will start shooting at you and you will die..."
1	 impressed."
1	 deal with it. Great potential so get the game if you want to support the devs(don't forget to bug report it helps alot)."
1	 and the devs have done a great job"
-1	 so if you hate that kind of thing wait until full release.For now all I will say is this game has great potantial to be a fun and adictive game. But for now I advice you too wait and see."
1	 think about DayZ Early Access it was terrible. So give Scum a Chance and let them 17 Devs some time!"
1	 but I can't wait to get more stuff implemented.Keep on the good work!"
1	Great game!
1	What tf is DayZ?
-1	 extremely disappointing"
1	It's like DayZ Stand-alone but playable.
-1	Game failed to start
-1	I do not approve the zombie buff. fix it.
1	7/10i really enjoy playing this game . There are bugs and other problems with the game however i have faith in the developers to fix them and further improve the game =D
1	 here's your game."
1	 gets a thumbs up from me as support for future development."
1	Awesome gameIt is unoptimized and the servers have some issues but its an early access after allThe price is stunning Emperor Palpatine / Do it
1	Im able to run this game on an nvidea 940m and and i5 dual core with ht (both beeing under minimun requirements). Also the game and the developers seem very promising. I would totally recomend anyone to try it out
1	 if you didn't suck you would have fame points and you can spawn on your squad. Man up fam learn the game."
1	This Game is far better then any other Survival Game on Day One and this is just the beginning.
-1	ton of character customization features are locked and when im trying to connect a server it failsDONT BUY THIS GAME(at least not now)"
1	 and frustration at times."
1	Great Game
-1	 fires and so on will vanish when you close the game! This is pretty much forcing people into renting if they don't want to keep the game running 24/7 to stop from starting all over again! This is prety much game breaking to me and a real nasty secret tax on the player! I can see a refund in my future if I don't find a solution fast and the devs will ban you from the forum if you highlight this!"
1	Feels like the original DAYZ mod with lots of neat additionals.Character creator that actual effects your stats.Indepth Statics you can track to make sure your Prisoner is in top form.Crafting SystemMap looks great. High End Loot isnt overdone and there is actual risk to getting it (not just other players).Would recommend this game to all who like DAYZ or other Survival type games.Heres to opening that the Devs keep up with their current roadmap!
-1	way too many bugsbad performanceshould not be in early accessconclusion: crap game
1	So far its an amazing game!
-1	 I don't recommend."
1	Spawned inGot some foodZombie came after me RanOut ran the zombieTook a quick poopGot a weapon and got killed by a high secured place with good loot10/10 would poop again
-1	No....
1	 it has such detailed survival mechanics unseen anywhere else and I can easily recommend getting it"
-1	 avoid."
-1	 no."
1	 I want to see how this game evolves and I'm looking forward more content."
-1	The Game needs more time its to unfinished
1	 it is fun to play but not playable because of lag and Stuttering ."
1	 I got the diarrhea."
1	chur
1	 we are counting on you that you can make this a best survival ever! Continue with the pace you're already going and teach the devs which made survival games and then left them how to be a good developer. You have something special over her i belive in you! wish you all the best.P.S. i love all the Croatian references in the game! Pelinkovac!"
1	Lol ignore the bad reviews. this game is dayz x10000 (coming from someone with 1.8khrs in dayz)
-1	 but being able to see your party members' names through walls isn't."
-1	if you like running through the forest for 2 hours just to get killed by a wallhacking robot... this game is for you!
1	 or get almost perma locked on. Game has TONS of potential. I will continue to play as long as i can get the sound to work. pc specs: i5 3.2ghz quad core.16 gb ramgtx 1060 6 gb120gb ssdruns game on almost all high setting with 60+ fps. But did crash because of a GPU error. It 2 framed and never recovered. Restarted and lost sound. tried multiple times and still have no sound at all."
1	 if dayz was like this game on Day1... but took 4 years to be 10% of SCUM"
1	Great game apart from the delay by almost an hour. Staying up late for this one carrrrn!
1	 this game is hardddd...one that you're going to have to invest alot of time into to be able to get in the higher ranks.(Next update at 5 hours)"
1	 it is not a bad thing but they need side missions where really good loots is so people can stop camping and actually move over the map.I will buy a copy for my bro and couple of friends as a gift and so should you :D"
-1	no objective
1	I'm really hoping this is the one. Please be the one...
1	+1 positive review
1	 this game doesnt seem quite complete and has quite the learning curve but it is a healthy level of challenging. I just wish it was easier to find people to team up with. Also be sure that you enlighten yourself to the dangers so you dont get slaughtered by some giant robot like i did :/"
-1	 but after a short time you will understand its just a mix of some Arma mods (bad ugly mix) on Unreal Engine."
1	 SCUM does not give that feel. I actually enjoy going through the towns looking for items because it feels like I am actually trying to survive. From the in-depth BCU stats to the vitamin/food type information it really feels like you are trying to stay alive.The zombies are top notch. They can pose a threat if they catch you unaware but most of the time it is easy to take them out or navigate around them.The graphics are out of this world. HOWEVER....... I can usually only run it for about 30 min before it crashes my GPU. I have a GTX 1060 6GB so I am not sure why I am having this issue. I have turned all the graphics down so if anyone has any other ideas I would love to hear them.I cannot wait for more and more patches and content to come out. This game has serious potential and absolutely worth $20+"
1	Best survival game so faar. But can u please add that the items in the Box won't disappear in the single player.
-1	 it crashes constantly and it is not worth buy. Give it a year then maybe."
-1	 and an 8700k and my fps starts at 100 and drops to 40-50 within an hour of playtime. No matter my settings turning to low only slows down the process and puts stress on my cpu."
1	 that bear -_-"
-1	 doesn't justify a whole team behind this game where they can release it as paid pre alpha but not enough content. Stay away for now unless you got no other games to play."
1	 this could turn into the DayZ we all wanted in 2013. Good Game. Good Devs. Good Price."
1	 but besides the game breaking bugs(which are gonna be fixed) this game needs more weu servers cause its really hard connecting to the american servers and join the few northern europian servers that are empty and high pinged!"
-1	Another early access survival game with really high pc specs needed to run above 30FPS
-1	 certainly not this."
1	 dont buy it for a while yet."
1	 the better off we'll all be in the long run."
-1	 but id really recommend buying something else.. youll be bored or annoyed in no time 4/10"
1	One of the best early access games to hit steam. Devs pushing updates on the regular. If you read this far just buy the game already! :)
1	Haha all the negative reviews from people with >2 Hours on the game. EA = Dont play if you can't handle the heat brah
-1	 I get 1 fps if i walk into a town and I hold when punching unrealistic scum worst game"
1	It's chill. Fixed my server. Just did a poo on it.
-1	 play a better game called 7 days to die. getting a refund."
-1	no search bar for servers?!!?!?!? CANCER
1	Love the game even though it needs improvements. Would reccomend to a friend. Can't wait for the updates!! Buy it now!!
1	 i will give 10/10"
-1	To many cheaters / too many hacks
1	 we can finally lay her to rest.                         Rest. In. Peace.                                DayZ    December 13 2013-August 29 2018"
1	 stable and immersive. There are a lot of things that need to be improved but so far it's going in the right way and it's worth the current price tag."
1	 and these guys come across as meaning business."""
-1	what a crap of  a game!! there are dozens of games similar and better!! what a waste of time!!
1	 but its overall a great game with a great dev team. 9/10"
1	Could use some more bones.
1	 glitches and everything else that has to do with EA games.I'm enjoying my time playing and I think you should pick this up and try it out yourself..Buy this and come kill me in game like everyone else does :\"
1	 stop whining about it until we see what this game and the devs are really capable of.  I'm pretty impressed by what I'm seeing so far."
-1	I'd wait a bit
1	Nice.
-1	hmm where to start well the game ran like garbage figured ok its on epic turned it down to low graohics and still every time i turn the slightest bit everything freezes and nothing changes and this is in a single player match i got to get customer support and get taken to something that supposed to have a customer support website specifically for this game but when i click it i dont see the word support or anything close that could be support in it i mean honestly did yall do anything with this before you throw it out making people pay for this crap
1	 and seem really dedicated to it."
1	 but can they be killed. or disabled? idk great game 9.8/10 recommend. doing amazing so far!!"
1	good game combat is a bit dodgy hope they fix it
1	Had explosive diarrhea 10 feet from a bear....                          ...... it didnt end well.
1	there're bugs and glitches cuz the game is still in Early Acess."
1	Its like being a homeless guy in chicago.
-1	my gtx 460 from 7 years which i paid $400 dollars for cant run the game! unbeleiveable. typical early access devs not optimazing their game
-1	 but that's like saying you're the smartest kid with down syndrome."
1	Great for only 1 week in EA
-1	Has potential. Would not recommend right now.
1	awesome game very realistic!!!
-1	Not playable. Do not buy.
1	 the game has a solid foundation."
1	 to buy stuff from other players or from a vending machine or somewhere.5."
1	 SCUM is gunning for you."
1	fix your connection bugs fast and fix your damage dealer you take to much damage for nothing i lost 40 health for jumping down from a shelther. but besides that its a fun game and i recommed it
1	 but mega depressing with them cheaters sometimes"
1	its improving
1	 I was apprecative that there was singleplayer added."
-1	Really dissappoting to be honest hunger level kills me more times then players and i have to poop every 4 seconds -10/10000 would not recommend
1	 comeback in one year maybe ! atm they need to fix servers then memory leak cause it's bothering most of the players. better anti-cheat functions too. losts of hackers are growing. still i can say it worth it and I recommend every one to have this game in their library. 7/10 Optimize FPS"
-1	Terrible. Nice concept. Atrocious attempt at creating a game. Good try but you obviously paid streamers to hype the game up.
1	 pick it up asap and grab some friends to play with as it definetly is more enjoyable with your pals. :)"
-1	 also boring"
-1	 cannot find any way to change and I dont want to risk loosing the ability to refund if I cant play the darn thing."
-1	 then theres a 0.1% chance of actually finding it."
1	 I like it and will spend most of my time on this game for awhile."
1	I took a poop from 1000m 10/10 would play again
1	 but it can be ""fixed"" with a memory cleaner program. (At least in my case it has worked up to some extent).Obviously the best part about the game is the fact that you can literally defecate on people you kill."
1	 devs constantly updating"
1	i love this game but im dying cuz i cnat cut my fkin clothes into rags for some reason so im loosing hp.... plzzz help
1	 a the sound of the drops on the leaves during a thunderstorm. (the tracks of our shoes in the mud too (just a decal to add with a fade out)))"
1	 and what we deserved.Can only go up from here."
1	Best survival game ever
1	 PICK THIS UP"
1	 and potential."
1	The timer needs a cap as god knows how long it goes up to and ive had to re-start several servers now so that is shocking especcially when i get killed as a fresh spawn like shouldnt their be a penalty for that? overall the survival aspect is good but the respawn timer isnt needed!
1	The Mechs haunt my dreams
1	 because there are many."
-1	 feels like a real slap in the face to their fanbase."
1	 but optimization its so bad"
1	 we being the community.We need base building. and some people will say ""ohh but you can build boxes and you will be able to fortify houses"". No we have a huge map why not fill it up with some cool bases like h1z1 or miscreated? it will give us a goal in the game not just running around endlessly. We also need some mode of transport. right now it takes too long to get to your friend or to get to places.. It just gets so boring..."
1	f.....ng awesome
1	 very challenging and great for squads!"
1	 cassette loaded games that took longer to load than your average MP match to HD heaven ;-)"
-1	disappointing just like dayz
-1	 map is very large it takes a while to move from a section to another lots of frame drops(Evga Gforce Gtx 1080Ti SC2) Also would like to mention the controlls are not correct"
1	 It just came out but the limit as to what it can become is the sky"
1	 and you can always refund it if you don't like it."
-1	Constant 30-40 fps with everything on LOW using a GTX 970 OC.. This is indeed a real shame for UE4.
-1	 but for now it isn't"
1	 however melee is still buggy agains both persons and zombies. Expected for an Early access game"
-1	 but today it's not. Pass on this one if you're unsure."
1	 but you might."
1	 let's just hope the devs don't get lazy with it being a top 5 seller and neglet to fix the very pressing issues with it in EA."
1	 but they're not spammed across the map and you can avoid them if you're patient and use stealth. The BCU monitor is also really fantastic. I actually made my skinny character fat after hunting the bear and eating all those bear stakes. So now I'm on weight watchers. Shout out to the devs as well. They are EXTREMELY responsive and they react quickly. In the first hour the servers crashed a lot (if you didn't expect that you have NOT been playing games for very long) but maybe an hour or two after release the devs already released an update that fixed the problem for me. I didn't have a single crash in 7 hours of playing. If you like survival games then this is the game for you. Thank you CroTeam for bringing this amazing adventure to us and letting us experience your world."
-1	 but to release at this stage with the tiny amount of content it has. SHame. I expect this game will be a far better purchase in the following months. Cannot recommend to buy at the moment however."
1	 If your unsure though wait untill its further developed. Its also made by a pretty good developer that puts heart into a game."
-1	 i so want this game to be fun but its not quite there yet"
1	 im confident you won't have to refund as long as you love hardcore survival games."
1	 and I will : )"
1	Great game with beautiful graphics and hands down one of the best survival games I have played in a long time.well worth the $20 we are a community of gamers (Chronic Gaming) that at first didn't know what to expect from this game but we gave it a try and what do you know a jewel is being born before us. I say in time this will be an amazing game with great features.If you would like to join our community scum server please feel free to join the discord we also have many other game servers that we host stop in and check us out :)-Discord Link-https://discord.gg/72h2f6u-Scum Server Details-Server Name:Chronic Gaming High Loot US-EIP address: 172.107.179.94:28602
-1	40 Hits with a Slaughter knife < 4 Hits ShovelBroken game ...
1	 ive had some great fun with firends and solo so far and i sincerely wish them the best of luck with all future plans/updates for SCUM and i will be ambitiously awaiting to see what they have in store. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1	 i totaly recomment this game to anybody that is a fan of survival games this is the dogs doolies... :)"
1	10/10 Best skat action outside of Germany. Would defo poop on friends face again.
1	 but im here for $20"
-1	 I cannot recommend"
1	Spent 15 hours getting amazing loot just to fall of a ladder and lose it all. 10/10 would autism again
1	 if there was somewhere where I could safely keep all my loot (or sell it) or some form of base building (but I'm not sure how that would work in this game)"
1	 dayz :D"
-1	solo gameplay is nearly (i play a lot of games like this) impossible try to get on a server and it will crash 30 seconds later framerate skips constantly i get that its earlly acess but it needs some work to be close to playable
1	 Ran away and bled to death in a bathtub I'll stick to fashion"
1	 and am remaining positive that they will fix the performece problems."
1	The game have potential. Waiting for future update. Pls dont abandon the game developer like the other does to their game.
1	 than this game might just be the one for you."
-1	 here it is in it's somewhat shining glory but personally I'm out. Refund on my part."
-1	 was having fun until the server problem ruined it."
1	 having many glitches like server issues as mentioned before and not being able to cancle actions. There are probably many bugs that I just haven't discovered yet. It still seems very promising and I would recommend giving this a try. Let's hope the issues gets fixed quickly :)"
1	 so I am not sure there is any server persistance."
-1	 or how much fiber is in your diet... you're just happy to find something to fill your stomach. In my opinion it'd be best to wait until this game is out of early access to see if it can distinguish itself apart from every other survival game out there."
-1	 but honestly. Until they add more stuff I can't recommend this one."
-1	 cheaters and hackers already own this game..... so sad. Can not reccomend at this time."
1	 it released like a week ago. We need more action! Thank you!"
-1	 BUT THESE TYPES OF GAMES ENCOURAGE THE HACKERS TO RUIN ALL YOUR HARD WORK. FULL OF HACKERS SO EARLY ON."
-1	 butthurt by the hype and want my money back in time to get gta instead."
1	 AND P!SS ON MY FRIEND AGAIN"
1	 but lots of potential"
1	 but for an early acess game its pretty good."
1	Enjoying it so far.
-1	 but no way do I want to literally walk miles in a video game because the systems are too punishing to allow you to push beyond that. I cannot recommend SCUM to anyone really. Unless your $20 really cant be spent someplace else."
1	 this game shows amazing potential!  The Devs appear to have a drive to keep the updates coming.  The first day of release saw server issues.  The very next day they updated the game and fixed the issues.  I'm very interested with this game and i can't wait to see where it goes!"
-1	Running simulator. Boring. Gigantic map and not enough players. Not enough loot unless it's the robot-secured places.
-1	 but as of now a huge waste of 20$"
1	 if this gets fixed the game is more then worth buying.At this point its basicly everything DayZ standalone promissed to be and more !Wait a few weeks and get it once the server lagg is fixed."
1	 better than DayZ"
1	 specially when you see devs so committed to improving it and face problematics ASAP."
-1	 literally unplayable."
1	 but it is early access and it is barely out for a few weeks. give it time and im sure this game wont become dayz when it comes out of early access. this game is great and has potential it just needs time."
1	 would reccomended"
1	 the puppets shouldn't be a problem.  I enjoy the game for sure and am looking forward to the future.  very good first impression for me."
-1	fix the game
1	 give it time)-Mechs are buggy and overpowered (being fixed as well)-only good loot is at bunkers/POI's (they are working on this as well lol)so pretty much... there is nothing bad about this game that they won't eventually fix. I reccomend buying it so that they have the support needed to get them fixed ASAP. thanks for reading my opinions :)."
1	Better than DAYZ
1	Please join the Chinese language as soon as possible
1	The people hating on this game really dont give it the credit it deserves with it being in early access.  It has done a ton of work and receives frequent updates and thats with the devs listening to players and trying to make everyone happy.  The game is not for everyone and definetly has a unique group.  It is kind of like dayz except it works and its got a good bit more to keep up with and I think will be very different in the end as well.  Overall its a great game with great developers and if u see people complain just remember that not everyone loves this sort of hyper-realistic type of game that these amazing developers have done a great job on.
1	Yeah i was just in a building fully geared with about 6 hours of looting. All of the doors are closed and I get sniped by someone far out because the building didnt render in. Why even release the game if people can shoot you in buildings. Ive died twice to other players in ways that i cant even defend myself. Im okay with the mechs and the zombie mele combat. But seriously? walls not rendering in? A game shouldnt be released if it has problems like that!
1	 so far very few bugs. It is still an Early Access game so not all features are there yet with missions and some creation options - but its completely a better experience than that ...ahem... ""other"" open-world zombie survival game and its only been out a week or two."
1	 as its genuinly fun especially with friends. I see alot of potential so far and am looking forward to seeing what direction developers take this game."
1	Good game. Well worth the 20. The survival side of it is new gen sh*t...
-1	 a game to potentially buy at a later date."
1	 either."
-1	 If they update this game enough it could find its niche."
1	 so good.fix items not showing on ground.  too much dependency on tab."
-1	 and that's about it. There are little to no players to be found (no PVP) and you cannot make a base to store your loot. Anyone that roams the environment can open your loot chest.Lacking a lot of things and needs a lot of improvement! Hopefully the Devs make progress and keep updating the game :)"
-1	This game captivates you with its cool looking nature and nice graphics but after 3h of game play you realize that there is nothing to do in it at all. same as dayz. I would advise not to buy this game until they introduce the lore and the end game.
-1	 not much to do in it at the moment"
-1	 hope dev team can add various kind of NPC.4. Multiplayer needs anti-cheat.5.Dont forget sea server too.6.For now just stable the game please before adding more stuff like cosmetics.Thank you."
-1	the ergo on macs are just stupid
1	"
-1	Boring
1	 just trying to even the reviews against people who are complaining about ghetty things that don't have anything to do with the game itself."
1	So far its really laggy but it will get better.
1	 so its normal.It has a lot of potential if worked well.Lovely mechanisms and realism aspects."
1	 good fps and good loot"
1	Pee'd on my friends head while standing on the roof. 10/10
-1	 die... Was hoping for something more in depth but I was really disapointed.Didnt crash tho and ran without slowdown on an i7 8700k and a 1080."
-1	can t  UPDATE.........lol"
1	Fun game but very buggy at the moment. The freezing of servers especially.
-1	Wouldnt buy the game right now its way to laggy
1	 will update review one day."
1	Empty Cupboard Opening Simulator 2018.11/10 would search 1000 empty cupboards again.
1	 I'm keeping it to support development but for anyone on the fence give it a few patches and see how it comes out."
1	[F] Search - No items found!finds sugar in the microwave and soda in the oven.
-1	 I can't set it back to English.So yeah that's a thumbs down for now."
1	 but after 10 hours of playing it gets really boring and repetetiv. They have to fix the desync because the pvp isnt worth doing if you only tradekill.."
-1	 i'm getting 50 fps on lowest setting and 30 on max... so there's a 20 fps difference between epic and lowest... the fighting is pathetic since your arms go straight through the ""puppets"" and doesn't deal any damage if this happens. The game got potential but i wouldn't recommend it as of today."
1	 and entertaining. I can't wait to see what comes later on down the road with more crafting and surviving abilities."
1	 Its only going to get better. 7/10"
-1	Same ol survival gameplay: Find a gun -> Kill other players -> Die -> Repeat.I hope the game devs will change the game so theres someting to aim for and this may give the game a future but if not i fear that Scum is going to fall flat.At this point i cant recommend.Will change this in the future if the game changes.
1	 I have had a brilliant experience so far and I'm sure most others will too if they put in the time to learn the mechanics before giving up on the game."
1	 Its a novel concept that most games seem to get wrong but SCUM does ever so right."
1	Day Z with actual developers lol
-1	Sadly the performance is extremly bad. If you don't own a 1080 or higher the game will be a slideshow. Also the game suffers severe memory leaks and your performance will reduce by an aditional 30% after playing about an hour (and even more if you don't relaod).In Addition Servers are crashing all the time.Gameplay itself looks nice. Movement System is really well done and the game seems to have a very complex loot system.Though because of the performance and server issues I can't recommend the game to anyone at the moment.
1	great game!
-1	The Roboters destroy the whole PVP in this Game. As long as they are in this game i would not recommend it.
1	 and this is without a shadow a doubt worth every penny.some games strive to be this good on completion and this is only a one week old alpha. so far almost daily patches that have improved the playability of the game with devs that give constant updates.....yes there is the odd lazy children who want satnav a vehicles but i believe they forgot to read past the title...this is a prison survival game and i would like to know where the item they are demanding got into a prison island...keep up the excellent work people... 8/10 so far.....i would give 10 but the fighting with puppets needs a lot of work....ie a puppet has a bigger reach than me while i am holding and swinging a large axe or club.."
-1	 still same. Ask for refund- nope you played for more than 2 hours. FML......"
1	The dayz killa.
1	Atleast one of us is getting proper diet11/10 for this game
1	 until I turned down my render resolution from 100 to 70 and went from 30 FPS on the lowest settings to 65-70 on medium-high settings.Then it sucked 10 minutes later"
-1	"Keep it nice and simple.You go onto the game and your first thought is ""Mad"".After an hour of running around ""Boring"".Give it a month or two."
1	jysla kjekt
1	super awesome game ive had lots of fun in here please continue to work hard to perfection the DEVS are active as ever thank you
1	Survival check yestakes a bit to learn wat to eat for minerals and vitaminspee and poop plus vomit bonusbreak bones yes my health is running out kak scaryfinding out you actualy needed to gym more at virgin for all the runningin the end actualy very nice wen playing with friendswww.sologaming.co.za
1	 you couldn't congratulate them more."
1	Wowzerz took a fat steamy sh*t in front of a player getting gangbanged by a horde of chompers
1	This game is great so far.  Obviously it is early access and everything hangs on the devs but even if I quit playing today I would feel that I got my money worth out of it.  I really hope to see it grow.
1	nibbas buy or back to dayz
-1	Unplayably laggy trash combat. Hungry before food ever comes up. Overcomplicated on things that dont need to be overcomplicated. Griefers galore.
1	 I like that they added SP! I cant wait to see what they add to this game hopefully we can see some ai bandits! But So far i am Loving this game!!!"
-1	 just keep an eye on it."
1	 and alot of bugs. Just give it some time ffs."
-1	 0 content is actually in the game(not 1 thing to do aside loot loot loot loot loot) also battle royal matchs triggered by a event timer(very nice) but boring as hell with 0 crafts to do 0 gear to make use of and storage cant be locked?..."
-1	 but the thing is they make it way to hard to understand... like the crafting system and the character information and dygesting etc. make it an easyer system!!!!!!"
-1	It's fun... If you have friends to play with. I just hope they add vehicles and actually fix the energy system because seriously WTF why is it on 0 and im getting fat after eating an apple??Might change the review depending on changes
1	 plays nice with about 30-40 ppl on a server not 64. so pretty lots to do needs work but its early access."
1	Like dayz but better executed
1	 try it out."
1	 chased a deer on foot.I cant wait to see where this game goes and how good it gets. They foundation is hella sturdy."
1	Better than Dayz
1	Cheaper then Dayz and i would assume runs better..I would say wait since it just came out but right now its worth a plus.
1	Very fun game!
1	 fix optimizationAwesome survival game!"
-1	unplayable amount of bugs
1	 creeping through the woods at night amidst the growls of wildlife and puppets is intense.  I am definitely in this one for the long haul.  I hope that it lives up to its potential.  It could easily become one of the best survival games on the market.  Buy it now why it is only $20."
-1	You've got to be a actual brainlet to enjoy this game.
1	Best poop simulator ever
1	This game has so much potential and is coming along pretty fast. Yes it has its bugs but the devs have been doing a great job with the updates. Cant wait to see what the future holds for the game.
1	 then this game is gonna be huge by the time the full release happens. 10/10 Would recomend to friends!"
1	Nerf the mechs...
1	Early Accress but very nice game! See you in one year again Dayz <3
-1	 it just needs the filling."
-1	 I guess there are better things to do in life."
-1	 SSD. Is there any optimization on this game? I have refunded it"
1	 get good and don't expect a finished game when you buy into early access."
1	9.5/10
-1	s h --- it
1	wish if you could just pick your poop up and throw them to someone
1	 the devs seem like they are going to do the best they can to support and develop the game."
-1	it s like dayz 3.0 boring as f uck don t buy it it s just a hype from streamers just sitting with  the gear doing nothing and people are watching this garbage ..... i ve refunded this sh it
-1	 play for 1 hour and 59 minutes then get a refund. you will see. :)"
-1	 but i I feel like if these points are not fixed I can't recommend this game to anyone.I will patiently wait for fixes/changes and edit my review in that case!EDIT 4th of September : 21:9 support is there. Thanks!"
1	killed a player then took a sh*t on his dead corpse then i ate him10/10
-1	Run for 3 hours. Find no one. 64 pop server with a huge map. Boring
-1	terrrible
1	 SCUM is an early access game which not only feels polished but has alot of content and is only going to grow.."
1	gUd gAmE !
1	 and dying many many...many...many...many... times."
1	 maybe a bit too much for my laptop to run but then again that could just be the optimization. really it's up to you whether you think it would be worth the money or just wait until it's updated a lot more to buy it but yeah it certainly does have the foundation of a nice survival game. not to shabby."
-1	takes forever to make things. just not for me. will get sniped.
-1	Honestly the game is mostly hype. The loot is VERY scarce and the charactar designer is kind of a joke as you can choose between 5 preset faces and you can ONLY be male at the current time. I refunded after 3 hours because of various bugs and the game (as I said) being VERY overhyped.On the upside the game looks ok (not groundbreaking) at the highest settings.I would say wait on picking this up for at least 6-8 months for more content to be in the game.
1	 maintaining a healthy metabolism (I love the complexity as I have a reasonable knowledge of nutrtion and physiology) and building fame points (this most likely with have more purpose with new mechanics)If your not ADHD this game may be for you."
1	Love The Game You Devs Keep Working Hard This To Me Is My Favorite Survival Game This Beats DAYZ 100% This Game Has Almost No Bugs At Least So Far But Sometimes Minor Issues Here And There But It's Still In Early Acess I Will Be Playing This Game Alot Because I Love The Game Keep Working Hard Devs.
1	 we hope to further optimize.2. build homes3. add vehicles4. perfect Chinese Translation5. resource addition"
1	Great game great start to a decent work in progress lol
-1	 but the controls are a bit clunky and a lot of things feel hit-and-miss. I may revisit this game once it's had some time to mature. Definitely not worth putting money into just yet though."
-1	 but he said that he will fix it by Deleting the game.the game continues to start to stop and start stopping to also startup to stop and start the stop of starting to stop the starting sequence of stopping and starting of stopping and starting of the stop in the startup of stopping because mr murray had to remove all planets in the game. he will never stop starting and stop starting to stop starting stoping start wont stop so the start kept starting and stopping and starting again and stopping angain and start stop start stopping start and stop start stopping starting of the starting and the stopping and the murray  would tell me to be quiet and then he would stop starting then it crashed.PLEASE... ANY HELP WOULD DO FOR A LITTLE BOY WHO ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY!"
1	 this game is superior in every way."
1	 making it easier to see what you have/what you need-Optimization (being worked on)Would totally recommend this game even in its current state. Loads of fun if you like the genre."
1	Probably the best early access launch to date
1	[F] SearchNo items found!
1	This is a great game already so it gets me excited to think about whats to come!!! I would definitely recommend this game!!!
-1	 looked in all of them tand the only thing to loot was a pair of shorts.I'll revisit this in 6 months when things get better."
1	 and the game play seems pretty smooth. a few bugs are still present but thats a given with Early Acess. some fetures still locked off.  if you enjoy games like Rust or DayZ your youna enjoy this. excited to see where this goes."
-1	The game is not fun.Sorry.
-1	Lying devs giving false keys out trolling the steam forums and general childish behaviour not a good look Gamespires and the discord team ..Constant Crashes joining servers .. no filter on server list which fool decided to release this in this state ? Too many bugs too list Seriously i wouldnt even bother !
1	 runs perfect and I've had a great experience so far."
1	 vitamins (if your casual you can just get away with eating and drinking and not be effected terribly) Try it for yourself its only $20 XD. Its the Dayz That will be finished someday! :D"
-1	 and zombies save your money"
1	Love It
1	Got killed while pooping. 10/10 would poop again
1	 and bring us SCUM in all it's glory!"
1	Fills a void in my gaming life :)
1	Very fun game with friends... can only get better from here and its already alot more fun than most survival games out there!
1	great game :-}
1	Good game.
-1	 crafting is rediculous and the controls are incredibly hard to master. REFUND_me_thanks_gg"
-1	 I avoided every single blow. But I bet the same was happening to his screen. Because no life was going down. Thing goes like that and gets more and more frustrating."
1	 closes door behind him while friend closes front door. Proceeds to beat man to death with metal baseball bat and friend using spear. 10/10 would offer cereal again"
-1	 crafting is rediculous and the controls are incredibly hard to master. REFUND_me_thanks_gg"
-1	 i didn't want to buy DayZ a second time"
1	what dayz should have been
1	+Not PUBG+Original +Less 13YO boys than RUST+Beautiful -No 4k support yet-No vehicles yetWould be nice if stamina was increased until vehicles are introduced.
1	so much damn fun. Basically DAYZ but 5x better. super optimized and although there isn't very much content as of right now im sure sticking through the early access portion of this games lifecycle will prove fruitful as the developers seem to care about the playerbase and what we want. Some small amount of DeSync issues. but presumeably that will be fixed soon enough. Gameplay-wise if you enjoy FPP/TPP survival hyper realistic games this is for you. I hope that with time this game will become one of the greatest survival games ever!!!
1	 this is epic. -Ben Shapiro"
-1	Was really exited about this game but its broken. I know its early access but just letting people know its not worth the $20 as it. Cheaters everywhere people just blink into exsistance an kill you. PVP is not possible becuase the loot is so low its not possible to find anything. Another hyped up surviaval game that is more of the same.
-1	 and have 800 Down 30 Up speeds. So it's the game."
-1	 might come back after this game is a little more optimized."
-1	prity much day z
1	 detect when you are behind them and 180 headshot you. When you try to bait them far off so your team can run behind them (a good distance off with trees and boulders blocking the line of sight) they still 180 headshot them and kill them after an hour of looting a base. MECHS ARE BROKEN AND OP PLEASE NERF."
-1	I dont care about hackers and anti hacks i'd rather run into a hacker once in awhile than every gun fight i get into have someone lag around a corner spraying with an ak 2ND thing get rid of the mechs theyre usless and they decrease performance zombies or puppets are good enough they are just really annoying and every gun fight you get into at the air field has to be inside pretty much 3RD thing get rid of the not being able to see people in 3rd person its super glitchy and feels really bad in combat when someone pops up out of nowhere if people dont like 3rd person they can play 1st person servers 4TH the games fps isnt to bad but the stutters are really bad and happens almost 100 percent of the tme when someone pops up because of the line of sight feature and once again makes combat feel super clunky other than all of that this game has ALOT of potential and i love alot of the other features like the crafting system inventory sytem and i love the fact that you can throw knives into peoples heads and kill them instantly
1	Aye lak twas gud n all dat
1	 vice versa"
1	 and new features/items. I'm really looking forward to using vehicles like cars and perhaps helicopters! Some more weapon customization/attachments would be nice too."
-1	 I can see this being a brilliant game."
1	 there's enough stuff in this game to make it worth $20 in fact i'd pay more.- Play with friends- 7 days to die style looting/crafting (very detailed)- zombies to kill- excellent graphics- You can attach barb wire to a bat and feel like Negan when you kill zombies- Giant map that will take you forever to exploreThese are just early first impressions the game has potential to surpass nearly every other survival game but it's not there yet.I rate it 8.5/10 for now though i'm sure the game will improveWatch out for the giant Mech Assault things they will end you.."
1	Best survival game
-1	 thus sapping all the joy and fun out of a multiplayer session with friends.At the current state the game also has intense memory leak and is not recommended for people having less than 16GB RAM."
-1	 just costs less. Bravo."
1	 vitamins and minerals; however this hasn't killed the fun for me yet. The hardcore survival genre is for a very specific audience so there will be plenty of negative reviews as well."
1	ANYONE WHO GOT A 1050TI OR LOWER   DONT BUY TTHIS GAME upgrade TO A 1060
1	promising
1	nice game
1	 Ark(ish) and H1Z1. Next generation survival game.This game as early access should be double the amount of money its asking for."
-1	 but needing to put items in different screens is a lesson in frustration.-Story line/goal/destination. Game seems sort of pointless.-Needs vehicles.  The traveling is boring and tedious.-Desperately needs more house models/zombie models/character features/etc.."
1	 cause it wont be."
1	This is the game I been waiting for 5 years ago when DayZ was a thing still. It is EA still so not everything is implemented in the game yet but as the game is now its still really fun and enough things to do to keep it entertaining till updates with base building and vehicles are implimented. I would wait if you want a full game. Right now its a walking simulator when it comes to traveling across the map to team up with a friend.
-1	 easily defeated by line of sight and doors.I had a good time initially and had fun but there's a lot to be desired. Maybe one day I'll revisit the game because the world is really beautiful and interesting but with Fallout 76 around the corner... I doubt I will."
1	 unlike Dayz."
-1	This game did not live up to the hype. Very disappointing. I really do hope it improves over time.
1	Very promising game. Runs smoothly now after a couple of days from launch. Many nice ideas that the devs just need time to implement. Will be the best survival game out there once they get going.
1	 keep up the good work Highly recommended"
1	 not pure BR PVP."
-1	 because the game is really cool. I feel like I'll just have to go spend thousands of dollars on an amazing pc to enjoy playing anything lol. Sorry...I get kind of salty with pc gaming being such a pain in the a**."
1	 the biggest 2 being robot/mech damage towards players and client side lag"
-1	was behind the box and the other guy got spooted and then it started to shoot me....GG"
1	 the game has improved ten fold in the short amout of time its been out and im sure will continue to get better and better. Awesome game guys. I'd buy it again."
1	 I have used zombies as a means to relieve myself of hostile individuals. I've been ranting on about H1Z1 not having similar capabilities for years!My last point is that this game has so much potential. All of the skills and nutritional jazz are artifacts of just that. I truly cannot wait to see what is implemented in the future."
-1	the hell with this game servers were wiped when new patches deployed
-1	This game sucksso far...
-1	 who in the world thought it was a good idea to implement that into a game... about killing people... I guess it does add reasons not to KOS.Not terrible. Not great. Lots of lag. Patches make lag worse. Can't recommend in current state."
1	 do not store any items in SP. as currently there is a bug that deletes stored items and crafted boxes.At 20$ i'd say that it is worth it as it currently stands. Just remember to eat a side of veggies and mushrooms with your friends leg."
1	 but want more 'direction'."
1	full release is is scheduled for 2019 so until then we cant complain to much."
1	Not bad for first week in EA. This game has alot of potencial.
1	 just burned out on it."
1	All these negative reviews have to be competing dev's or something because this game is legit for an early access. I'm a few hours in and already like it more than the failed DayZ standalone. Now that game was a cash grab. Keep up the good work on this game. It has the potential to be great.
1	 lockers etc...i think having bases will make this game so much better."
1	 a decent crafting system and a very small learning curve."
-1	 or rounds in the same location. This game is time consuming and lacks reward when hunting for resources and equipment endlessly for no real reward. I wasn't impressed. I may revisit closer to release but not for now."
1	 and what direction they are taking it. I would HIGHLY reccommend this game if you enjoy the old school survival shooter type. I'm very excited to see future updates."
-1	 Hold onto you pennies and wait for updates."
1	 not too expensive and has massive potential. The developers are very active and listen to the community and what they want for the game. I think that it will become a hugely popular and enjoyable multiplayer game in the near future. 10/10"
-1	I like the game but can't recomment it until they fix the cheating and hackers.
1	Friend pooped in front of me so I peed on his head.10/10
1	great game
1	great game
-1	 PLAY LATER."
-1	The average time it takes to climb a ladder on SCUM is equivalent to climbing 3 ladders in MGS Snake Eater.
1	 deer runs away with the spear in its head>mfw left with no spear12/10"
1	 I'm sure they will fix it.You got PVP & Solo (pve) options.P.S! after you kill another player you can squat down and take a HOT steaming sh*t in their mouth!"
1	 i think theres no survival game near this!"
1	If your into open world zombie survival games DO NOT GET DayZ Get THIS.                              And also if you got the extra couple bucks get the Supporter DLC also.
1	Extremely good dev support. However poor 21:9 aspect ratio support but playable.
-1	the game is amazing but the connection been really bad i hate how people teleporting around you have to fix this part otherwise it does not worth what you pay for !!!
1	 truly what dayz was meant to be in its ultimate form. You won't regret buying it although in the current Alpha I get 40-60fps all settings low 1440p with a GTX 1080 so if you have a weakish card maybe give it a pass until you upgrade"
1	Loved this game
1	Avoiding Mech Simulator 10/10
1	GG
1	 interaction etc.-deep metabolism simulationcons-server issues-unstable performance-fame system needs rework"
1	 and adding content. This game has so much potential to be an absolute unit. I would highly recommend if youre looking for a fun FPS/survival game. Easily one of the best purchases I have made on steam under $30."
1	Addicted game
1	 and taking a massive bowel discharge on his decapitated head."
1	YES ! VERY GOOD ! Thank you Gamepires for this title.
-1	 until then Day Z would b a better choice"
1	i take back what i said because they fixed a lot of stuff within a hour made a small patch. its ran better since then and played for over a hour with not losing connection had a great time cant wait for new updates on stuff great game i love this game!
1	Awesome game.its looks cool and it is cool :D
-1	 and that would make this a really solid EA. Get vehicles in with a few more weapons and sights maybe and we have something real special."
-1	 please"
1	whats up with the servers
-1	Server browser is from 1995ez refund
1	SCUM is a promising survival game which introduces lots of new mechanics for more realism. At first glance it may look similar to DayZ but imho it has a lot more depth and cool features. Try it out! 10/10 would recommend
1	 Im just here to battle the bad reviews an hour into launch."
1	just awesome
1	This game is just a perfect survival game
-1	 but for now its a hard pass."
1	Loving the game just wish i had more freinds to play with. Add me if youre keen to jam some scum!
-1	 strength and melee and I still couldnt take out a zombie with a crowbar. Guns are realistic but too realistic for gameplay."
1	So far so good! Couple of bugs but I know the game wil improve!
1	Great complexity even in its EA state. I hope they dont dumb down things.
1	 supposed  to play with friends for it to be good"
1	 may as well be a 10/10"
-1	 how do players cope with this in multi-player? The other thing I wish that could be possible is the ability to play on LAN only. I haven't looked at all at multi-player in anyway simply due to the two issues above. I'd also like to note that there is quite a bit of lag in areas with larger towns/cities. I turned everything down and quite a few things off just to be able to go to those areas and I still lag. I wouldn't recommend this at this point in time. Maybe as time goes on and changes are made I will consider updating my review."
1	AHH  ME CHINESE ME RIKE THIS GAME
1	yo its fun to play
1	 waiting for new updates!"
1	50 hours in and tho i've had a few issues with connection drop to servers this game has some great potientiali Hate mushrooms IRL and i have never done so much research on them as i have playing this game The health system looks like you need a medical degree to figure it out but it is quiet simple and easy to get your head around as long as you check it Crafting fairly straight forward easy to do with you having accesss to anything in your immediate vacinity plus whats in your inventory I'm looking forward to future of where this game can go
1	ye
-1	Graphics are poor and it's just dreary!
-1	bad optimizationlittle content
1	cant loot any of the good places with out hearing THREAT DETECTED and 500 rounds being sprayed at you THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED
1	I absolutely love the game so far just would like to know when the next wipe date will be.
1	 or let us tame the horses at least"
-1	 of course with its own little twist like a tedious nutrition system and ""realistic"" stats. I do not recomend this"
-1	 cargo containers and more. If it can see you through it can also shoot you through it as well from what I've seen. The robots detection mechanic needs a massive revamp on how it sees people and they need to be taken out of the game in the mean time. It's actually ridiculous atm so I'm not going to play until it's fixed. There isn't any point in playing when most of the combat takes place at military installations only to get shot through a object by a robot for the seventh time in a row."
1	 flows well for me. I play essentially with one hand which is hard with a lot of games but not this one. scroll wheel for changing your walk/jog/run speed is great and love the crafting/inventory system (lighting a fire you ""select"" lighter/match/etc. as well as the campfire then select ""light"" as an example.Gameplay: Nearly nonexistant in single player but still can find things to do. Multiplayer I am looking forward to when I try it out."
1	 Great job."
1	 hopefully that gets re worked. 7. more animals please8.is fishing a thing????9. crops???10. the basic shelter/ lean to  should be able to be crafted with ropes... why it requires 6 rolls of thread seems pretty difficult... and seems weaker than improvised rope..   These are just a few thoughts untill i get more time under my belt.  The game is still fun but that could be just because its still new but its very frustrating to do just the simplest of tasks...  If you get in on the game now while its only $20 its very much worth it... but if it were priced like a triple A game right now i'd say forget it..."
1	Poopin' on it.
1	 which makes it hard to engage PVP. -Servers going downRight now you have to reconnect once in a while. Keep in mind that this review is only after two sessions of playing and the game is only two days into early acces. The potential of this game is huge."
-1	 by survival games always ending up flopping."
1	 when i go out and want to go back i got lost where the place i build before."
1	 the worst thing I have found is just some inconveniences with the crafting and inventory menus or dropping items (guns) from your hands when you go to eat or craft or climb a ladder etc."
1	 and for that I would say if you have the extra cash and want to support the devs definitely do so."
-1	Takes hours to find guns and ammo. Have to run for miles for tiny towns. BOREDOM GAME SUCKS
1	So far so good.
-1	 respect for you!"
-1	Mechs shooting you through walls. players desyncing everywhere - F*cking DONE with this game!
1	Great game for the future! If you try the alpha you get hooked inmediately.
1	 play something else and come back to SCUM once it has some major updates under its belt."
1	 This game rips the pair of them apart allready!!! & its only early access!!! Muhahahahahahaha!!! Join today!!!!"
1	nice
1	 cannibal-raider friend."
1	 while trying to maintain your shaky alliance with the other orange clad goon skulking about the aircraft hangars. As it stands scum is an interesting twist on an already established genre and with future updates looks to become a very promising and entertaining title."
1	 and begin having fun. No need to suffer for hours to try and find fun in the game. Cant wait to see future updates!"
1	 finally."
1	 etc."
-1	IT IS JUST A TOXIC DAY Z CLONE AND I Have a 1060 6 gb i can only reach 30 fps on normal graphics would not suggest at all
-1	 maybe in the future."
1	45 fps achieved with Unreal Engine - Seems legit
-1	 but you are not allowed to drive them.The most tedious and humdrum ""game"" I've ever seen.I will definitely refund this cause I bought the supporter pack and I really don't want to support this product."
1	good fast update
-1	plz fix your FOV.
-1	 dont buy this game coz you cant play it yet"
-1	 but hope to have Asian servers."
-1	 then be penilised if you die again lmaoEDIT: No anti cheat....really? (Updated: Now at least has EAC protection"
-1	 but making someone pay for this utter garbage is ridiculous.  You can't even fist fight/melee fight someone yet.  When you get near another player you just go into insane lag mode where you jump around the other one and you're not able to hit them.  I got a refund after 37 minutes of gameplay and I suggest anyone else to do the same before putting to many hours in.  This company doesn't deserve your money if their going to be this greedy.  Game should be free alpha until its at least the tiniest bit playable."
1	mabuk free.... 10/10 will play again
1	this game is going to be huge...massive...what a game this is...love it...graphics etc are fantastic...its immersing...very addictive...cant fault it...devs fantastic job on this game....still under develpment...wow...10/10..so far...p.s..and for the price wow cant go wrong...
1	Very promising survival game. Way more polished than DayZ when it was released and developers actually seem to put effort in. If devs keep up the good work this game could be special.
1	 you won't regret buying this gem!"
-1	 if you play in a 64 ppl server and than go to another one you have to do everything again."
1	"Hey guys Game is great i love you "")"
1	 and do their best to patch issues quickly. Updates are almost daily."
1	 10/10 would buy twice."
1	 or using 2 clips on full auto from an ak witch is like wasting 3 hours in 2 secconds takes a huge dumpsome  additions if your going to have tec-1 buildings and mechs there needs to be some not a lot but some npc guards as well instead of the zombies at military bases as with the storyline of being a prisoner sent there to be part of a show i dont see a company advanced enough to make mechs leaving them behind on guard but no troops and leaving the buildings full of gearnpc bandits if implemented ide say rare random spawns with decent gear lastly even if not the two npc ideas another would be adding in roaming hordes of zombies of varying numbers tho that will only really work if you do something like i mentioned earlier with editing speedagain love the game keep up the good work and i cant wait to see how the game develops it could very well become the ""guide"" for future survival games"
1	Hard working devsFun to streamsnipe10/10
1	 fix the UI stretching for ultra wide."
1	good game hotfixed in the first hour. yay
1	 it hits home with the old Arma 2 DayZ mod days."
-1	 if done right will be what DayZ dreamed of being. Right now though id say its in a prealpha state and needs ALOT of work. Hope the devs stick to their guns but as of right now i cant recomend this game."
1	 or even just with normal people. So yeah... There's a lot of room for growth and the dev has big plans so it's definitely worth pitching in 20 bucks to see how far we can take this game. Ooone bad thing however is... My character sounds like they're tap dancing on the floor when I'm just trying to crouch sneak. wtf please fix"
-1	Would be good minus the hackers.
1	Best survival game ever!!!
-1	 STUPID ME. MOST OF MY HOURS PLAYED WERE JUST RUNNING TO FIND NO LOOT AND CONSTANTLY GETTING KILLED BY HACKERS. DEAD WORLD DONT BUY!"
1	 and I gotta say its really fun to try and survive in the wilderness. I can totally recommend this game to anyone who has a survival craving! I give this game a 7/10"
-1	The game is interesting but...10 chiters out of 10
-1	 let them earn your coin"
-1	 but the game did not exit properly and a backround process was still running so by the time steam support saw my refund ticket I had 4 hours game time and could not get a refund. Game not exiting properly should not be my fault."
-1	just a fad
-1	I haven't even played an hour of the game. The performance that i am getting on my gtx 1060 max q is ridiculous. I cannot even maintain a solid 50 fps without dipping into the 10s and 20s. I will consider playing this game in the near future when the devs optimize the game.
1	 i just hope they sort this problem out very soon i will still be playing."
-1	This shiiiiiiit is wack. Taking a shiiiit in real life is more enjoyable.
-1	 unnecessary and irrelevent people.)Yes I do have a perfect reason to moan as I've watched plenty of videos and even bought the deluxe edition to write this review."
1	 8gb ram on epic seetings. when i find time i will upgrade this."
1	I really like the game so far. Will report back once I've played more.
1	In all honesty i feel like im playing Dayz on the Escape from tarkov engine with mechs its a ok game but need better server support and maybe a loot buff
-1	"Lets put it this way...I paid for this game! Played two hours and wished I had those two hours back. Requested a refund from steam which I received. If I had to do it all over again... hell ""NO"" would I buy this. Check back maybe in a few months...right now I cant recommend this one. Just read all these other neg. Most of which have been covered as to why a neg.Spent two hours and the ""loot"" system is aweful. Servers are crap at the moment. Didnt see any other person on a full laggy server in those two hours. I could go on...I'll check back in a month or two..."
-1	Sadly the game does nothing to help or keep players engaged. Even meeting up with friends was easier on any other survivel MMO.
-1	No items found simulator 2018...
1	 but with community support and feedback (not just straight up complaining and whining about an early access game and problems that are to be expected with an early access game) this could seriously be a great game if it can realize its full potential."
1	Nice Graphics nice frame rate for early access play style is fun couple of bugs also game has potential which is good. Love a good hardcore survival game
-1	 Just better optimalization thanks :]"
1	 unlike DayZ.. devs are actually active and reply to alot of comments and are trying to fix minor bugs ect within the game. The crafting in this game is great. the fact you can make bullets instead of finding them is a lot shorter of a process as sometimes it feels impossible to find the bullets your gun requires!.. over in its current state 7/10 of course theres room for improvment.. but what game isint? for it only getting launched yesterday and to be better than 90% of survival games is a good thing for me.. keep up the good work"
1	 and I am excited to see what this game becomes."
1	 The DayZ Standalone i wanted."
1	Good
1	 this game like many with players and friends becomes much more funMy community is:https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/4/1737715419902443599/"
1	 like somthing up to a red dot to a gun butstock and flashhiders ect ect anyways this game is pure perfection for a early access except for the internet problems."
1	A very detailed yet very simple survival game... Sometimes spawn sucks so you need to walk  s h i t  or kill yourself but there is loot wherever you spawn... All in all great game from my home country Croatia! :D
-1	I played ARK and Rust for years every single day. This is the MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! Returned.
-1	 then it will be as dead as Starcraft. LOL."
1	It's more than perfect for an Early Access game.
1	 but overall seems minor.  The robots incorporate some great tense moments and really add to the experience.  f"
1	Excellent game for early access. I've bought 10+ EA games (Early Access) and this one has been in the best shape on launch day and proceeding days. The game is definitely playable and fun. No it doesn't have much for end game at the moment. Yes a few things need tweaking. Yes both of those things are expected for early access.
1	If you ever played original dayz.. Wow.. Scum understands. A genre that is so important to so many. Thank you for stepping in the right direction scum. Im finally back to spending hours just in the unknown..
1	 then this game is pretty darn good. I'm enjoying it and I've already gotten more than my money's worth from it."
-1	"Im not sure how i can say this without being a pee pee licker. Ok my name is jason and im 23 years old my dad was framed for killing my mom and i have to say his game has gr8 graphics. When she came home from work one night my dad was drunk... drunker than normal. The combat is handled very well for a survival game. I tryed to get between them but my mom said go to your room your will only make it worse. That night i heard my mom and dad yelling all night at eachother. The loot is not spaced out very well and it can take some time 2 find/craft ammo. The yelling stoped i walked out to find my mom laying on the groud with my dad standing over her lifeless body. ""Dad why have you done this"" My dad looked up and said ""overall its not a bad game but it needs work i can nor recomend it at its curent state""."
-1	TRASH
-1	Singleplayer is unbearably boring Multiplayer is a desync mess
1	you can kill a man and take a dump in his dead corpse11/9100% would buy again
-1	Jogging simulator. Good practice before going to track to understand the mechanics of resting between runs.
1	It's good but needs work
1	The game is super fun and enjoyable and the pvp is well worked however the robots need a nerf or rework they are to overpowered.
1	Holy hell is this game amazing.Anyone complainging about it doesn't understand what Early Access means...Easily one of the MOST polished Early acess titles I have ever played.
-1	zjebane
1	 you can eat them. 10/10"
-1	Tech-demoCould use more content and admin tools
1	 but he was afk so I sat aimed at him for a moment he comes back panics tries to shoot but I was quicker to the draw and revenge was mine we successfully escaped after that.  THAT is my scum story."
-1	its so bad dont buy it
1	 which can be really annoying when you're having any kind of moving fight."
-1	crafting is an unorganized cluster f**k
1	i try so hard to find pokemon in this game but none appear i walk through gras for hours on end trying to catch a simple ratata but instead i find ash and his crew roaming the streets of tarkov and now im stuck at lvl 44 with no more missions what am i supposed to do i really enjoy need for speed but honestly no one plays it anymore think about it you race a few cars here and there and you end up capturing objective D in battlefield its very upseting and confusing i though this was 2018 i had a great lunch but it started to rain.......
-1	 because I really enjoyed eating fat and raw meat from a deer."
1	Can chop up anything and then proceed to pee over it10/10 would play again
1	I pooped out a pineapple & then ate it. Money well spent.
1	Great game !
1	 which makes players appear to be teleporting more so than walking. As well as hacking which I know they are already working on."
1	 and plenty of content yet to be released. If you dont enjoy it in it's early access I'd recommend coming back in a month or two to see the game's progress. 20$ is very cheap for a game this good."
1	 I recommend the game so that it may continue to grow and develop into the game we all dream about."
-1	 this was suppose to be my positive paragraph... As you can see this game has a very very long way to go.  I really hope the scum team can get it together and make an awsome game."
1	This Game If you can even call it a Game' Lmao Is amazing A one hit wonder The resurector Of dayz This has so much more devolopment to go into it but as it stands now is the best Game In its Genre!!!
1	Dont be fooled by people saying the net-code is bad it has been fixed unless you internet is trash its a great game if your not attached to your loot and dont mind hopping servers for some fast paced pvp. Its worth the money for what it is at the moment. 9/10 lost a score because of the netcode on launch.
1	I like how the default name is Ben Dover (Bend Over)
1	Please add cities instead of small towns...
1	)))
1	 7 Days To Die etc then your going to feel right at home in here. I am more a pve hardcore player but found myself with friends having such a good time in the pvp server. Even in its current state its excellent. The in game features are above and beyond what you get in any other survival game and are only going to expand. It's not perfect at all but its Early access and thats to be expected. It needs better optimisation but the Devs are to on it and have already done alot on week one to address issues. The back story is also great as your on a reality show like the old movie The Running Man. I don't myself have the lastest computer but have been running this fine. But it does have issues that they are looking into so I like many have had frame drops which you have to log out and in to correct atm. Overall an amazing experience and already had some unforgettable times with mates in stitches laughing at things going on in this game. So great solo or with friends. But I do recommend with a friend as this  is a great team game and so much fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ohh and the supporters pack not only are you supporting the hard working Devs but what they give you for it makes it well worth your extra cash and they say more will be added in the future."
1	 and will only get better as it transitions into a fully fledged title."
-1	Multiplayer is not working properly.
1	 looking foward to updates. 6/10"
-1	walking simulator
1	great
1	 worth playing now and should only get better!"
1	Early access this game have time to get better!
-1	Nothing to do yet <3
1	 be better when they add vehicles and bases"
-1	 I will wait for real updates and then update the review."
1	oof
1	>chugged a bottle of whiskey>drunk af >killed a zombie with an axe>killed a donkey with an axe10/10 never felt so manly
1	 7 days to die and so on is nothing compared to what this could be.BAM !"
1	 16/11 would beat again."
1	 I look forward to playing more and seeing what else is yet to come"
1	one of the best early access games - betas out there
1	 Can currently recomend again."
1	Its good for the price
1	Already a lot better then dayz. Great potential!
1	 haven't done much solo yet. Good amount of loot. Doesn't feel to frustrating. The Puppets & Animals keep it interesting.Looking forward to further development of this early access game."
1	 this is the game for you my dudes:)"
1	 that just sucks really bad. Can't wait for future updates though :)."
-1	 and you'll get a much better game."
1	 everything including the menu is pushed down and to the left. I have no idea how to fix this. All my video settings are set correctly"
1	 definitely playable"
1	HYPE HYPE HYPE!
1	Great game apart from the delay by almost an hour. Staying up late for this one carrrrn!
-1	Shelter and fame points vanish after Quit game in SinglePlay Mode."
1	Met a guy who was very nervous about my presence. While pointing his gun at me he directed me into a corridor with a door at the end and told me to leave. I started walking slowly towards the door. A sentry sniped me through a window. I think the guy was really sorry. If you read this: I forgive you!
1	 with some elements similar and more survival things on top. Check it out and see if it's something you would enjoy.Thanks for reading this far!"
1	with a load of work this game is going to be brilliant !
-1	 I have low fps in this game on low settings so can i refound this game"
-1	 bots in this game are op its not even challenging its just unfair. All locations are basically identical. Game was fun for the first few hours and thats it."
1	First strategy RPG in years to allow you to pee pee poo poo
1	 finest gameplay I've seen in a long time. The amount of micro is absolutely amazing.  Really strong graphics and gameplay. The crafting of items is a great spin and I'm sure there are plenty of hidden recipes as time goes on!"
1	 in what year 6? Lots of good lots of bad but I will not put anything down until the devs have time to do some work on their infastructure which they can;t test until well steam release. I peed in some guys pool 10/10 Would pee on you for free if you keep leaving stupid reviews!"
1	 nor have I seen a man take a enitre door way up to tell me he is going to eat me holding a shotgun to my forehead while I am looking out the window and him saying ""Fat albert is gonna eat you"" before blowing out my brains."
-1	 (watch?v=n0OUFVRyJbU)"
1	 man."
1	Good game
-1	 but I can't recommend it until then."
1	 additions and features."
-1	 hopefully they make some much-needed improvements."
-1	its actualy scam not scum game is really unfinished and need some time to be much better ...
1	 it will only get better"
-1	 the game is dead already H1Z1 all over again dont buy"
1	Seems like the cheaters are getting taken care of and updates are pretty frequent.  Performance is low at times due to a possible memory leak but the game is a lot of fun.  For a very early access game the bones here are solid for a stellar open world survival experience. Devs are responsive.  Lag issues are to be expected and can make pvp frustrating but overall the core gameplay loop is a blast.I would love more primitive living viability in the future before more guns and advanced technology to favor thinking over luck in looting....  but... still better than DAYZ.
1	 i think they will add more. Oh not to mention the diarrhea is lit af.I definitely recommend this"
1	Can you guy please fix the FPS Leak. After some time the FPS drops significantly and have to restart the game for it to come back normal. Thank you
1	I recommend this game. This is a great game and has alot going for it keep the updates coming plz. also trying to squad up with steam friends should be alot easer than it is but other than that once u get started theres not that manny problems becides some server lag once is a wile but still worth the $20 i do recomend you up the price to $25 or $30 and push out some more updates to keep the fan/player base happy keep up the good work and don't be a SCUM about it lmao thanks.
1	 it is well worth the $20 while it is that price."
1	A true survival game with a rich and beautiful map.
1	combat abit strange b/c of focus."
1	  It will be cool the have cars or bikes :)"
1	 player dysnce and what i believe is a slight memory leak after about 3hrs of gaming without client refresh. I have no idea of what people are calling ""end game"" loot for this is a survival game and there really is no such thing as end game. Realize before buying this game that it is EA and will only improve from here. Only cost $20 when i feel it shouldve cost way more. DayZ has bee surpassed and will never be as good as this. 10 out of 10 in my book after the current issues are fixed. Well done Devs. P.S Devs your robots aim snap needs to be adjusted. Tad op in the state that they are in. Just my opinion though."
-1	Gave me a fatal memory error everytime I tried to load in. Found 0 fixes. Refunded. Hope you all have fun though!
1	 increase the loot and have at it. I think this is going to be far and away the best survival/pve/pvp game you will find. Bravo...Scum team....Bravo 10/10"
-1	tHIS IS PURE GARBAGE GAME! DONT BUY AS YOU WILL BE  VERY SAD THAT YOU SPENT 20+ FOR THIS TRASH GAME
1	 since English isn't my native language."
1	 put it this way if you loved Dayz for the game not the product and then felt stiffed by the devs as im sure we all do/did this is for you.Great jobs devs you got a gem here that is without a doubt king of this genre now."
1	 still enjoy playing after 22 hours."
1	 can fully recommend this game for the price. once they put in more stuff it will be awesome!"
1	 I can say with total confidence that this game is deffinately worth your time if you are a fan of truly hardcore survival simulation. :)"
-1	NOTHING TO DO IN THE GAME DONT BUY
-1	just no
1	No items found!
1	Here we go Day z all over again.
1	 p!ssing also. Mech robot is broken. Overall awesome game would rate 11/9."
-1	wished they would have taken more time to fix ingame problems. Biggest Issue is the lag between players and the DC 10 x in a hour problems. Even if it is EA it's not playable at this stage of the proces. Wait a couple of months and if they fix it then i would suggest buying it. For now i'm asking for a refund because at this stage it's a waste of money and time.
1	 so yeah buy it imo...!!! gj devs keep up the good work!!!"
-1	 but not a lot to play with."
1	 this is a GREAT buy!"
1	 16GB and a four y/o i7 CPU."
1	It has great potential! I can urine on people 10/10!
1	although still in the development phaze this game will be awesome once completed
1	 killing and managing your nutrients to survive. Will update later."
1	 running away from mechs makes the game interesting."
1	 but actually even more fun for the survival fan base."
1	 has me really intrigued.I've taken loads of screenshots as the game looks gorgeous at times.It's best played with friends."
1	 a tribe or gang adding and more items to craft like building a base."
1	 for me it is everything DayZ wanted to be and MORE!I am really looking forward to seeing how much this game can evolve! Highly recommend if you like DayZ."
-1	 and 1st peron FOV sucks."
1	 hands down."
-1	empty..
1	 and i mean quickly."
1	People that are leaving negitive comments and barely any hours played just have nothing else to complain about. This game is great and can't wait for more stuff
1	Game is early access and lots of fun!I am extremely excited for what is to come in this game.
1	 having to sneak into bases and and learn their patrol paths is extremely fun and scary at the same time and very rewarding if you manage to escape. Extremely fun if you get a squad rolling with some buddys highly recommend playing with at least 1 other person."
-1	 save your money."
1	i pooped off a dam
1	Been waiting for this game since 2017 and scum didn't let me down <3
-1	Ill change my vote to yes recomend when anti cheat is added. A guy spawned on my group and had god mode and unlimited sprint.
-1	 in its current state i wouldn't buy this."
1	Worth $20? Absolutely.
1	 I would now recommend this game to my friends since they mostly use ultrawide monitors as well."
-1	but its clearly they releas this game without testing it there is no way they didnot find 1 bug will i found for sure 3 bugs within 1 hour"
1	very good is fun i like
1	game runs great feels like how dayz should be it is early access but worth it for 20.00
1	If they are going to wipe the server like rust the game will run dead fast...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
1	 and going to the bathroom.8/10 in it's current state. (and considering the amount I've played) Would poop again."
1	  980Ti still handles it in the 60 fps range https://youtu.be/FpaI8_ivkvY"
1	 and with the recent AntiCheat addition the game is about at a ""tolerable"" level. I look forward to further development and improved gameplay."
1	Most thrilling game I've played in a long time. Absolutely brilliant!
1	better than dayz
1	If you duck the zombies can't hit you. Shows potential.
1	 i feel like if they did figure out a sweet spot for PVP soon then they'll have a new big game. Thank you for reading this if it helped you at all like it and if it didnt dislike it. As all ways you guys are more than welcome to add me if you need tips for the game or possibly play with me your more than welcome :) thank you have a GOOD DAY"
-1	 i hope.. However as of now I would consider other reviews and a second thought before not only throwing money down but time down as well. Cant wait to see what it becomes. Ill update the review whenever its state changes for the better."
1	Awesome single player experience so far considering it's an Early Access game!
1	Game cant run properly. I have more than enough to run the game yet there is constant freeze frames for me and it makes the game unplayable. Basically there will be times in the game where when ever I move my mouse the game will stutter and freeze. I like the concept of the game but in this current state i can not play the game.
1	 granted this game has been out on early access for a few days.11/10 would recommend!!!"
1	dayz but better
-1	 or base building."
1	 why? Because I understand it is EA right now and I know that it is going to change quite a lot in order to improve the existing issues and mechanics; I am not at all concerned about the developers commitment here and they have already patched it quite a bit since release.I look forward to seeing what the future has to offer for SCUM."
1	 it is very cheap and you will spend a lot of time playing it and you wont get bored of it in a long time."
1	 along with vehicles and clothing options and we have a sure winner.  So far I love this game and will continue playing it as long as it continues on an upward develpment path."
1	 have complete potato pc/ internet and struggle to run the game/ maintin decent ping  our server ip 176.57.178.69:28002discord https://discord.gg/C5z8Sbr"
1	 we need more games like this."
1	The potential of this game is amazing. Depth of detail which bring the amusment to the max. Already fun game for an EA & can't imagine it at full release
-1	 thats it. its a boring countryside with very sparce farmland and killing yourself is the only option to do that makes sense. save your money MAYBE if they dont take there winnings and run the devs MIGHT fix this all one day. but i bet this crap is it. play rust or ark if you think you might want this. there better and more completed. worse 20 bucks spent on steam"
1	Beautiful :*)
1	Loving it soo far!
1	 initailly the servers were not great but within 1-2 hours everything was running sweet on my PC I built way back in 2011 (System specs are on my profile) and getting on epic settings a steady 60 FPS and dropping in towns but still very very playable unlike other titles.Awesome game with devs that are obviously passionate about their product and community!"
-1	This game has potential... but it feels like one of those free to play zombie games rn. It feels cheap and rushed.
1	10/10 Like skyrim but with Croatians
1	 if you actually want a weapon then go to the bases with sentries and probably die.Beautiful graphics and love the guns!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB2ULwA7VyA"
-1	 but I've moved on."
1	 they serve no purpose .. literally no-one likes them .."
1	 I mean that you can find a lot more than just hats (it looks like there one in every house). there's a lot of room to improve. Even though it is a multiplayer game it is really hard to meet your friends on the map so you often are running alone."
1	 but it is called a ""supermax"" game for a reason."
1	 crushed by robots. This game is awesome."
-1	dudes its a walking simulater. there was only a hand full of servers that hdd palyers in them.
1	Pooping on enemies +1
-1	 I have the reccomended specs."
1	 wait a couple of months. But for every true survival fan i can recommend it even at the current state."
1	10/10 best game ever you can pee and poop
1	If you like DayZ or survival games in general. Then you will like this atleast 10x more. It's just that much better and thats from after 2 weeks of Early Access.
1	I ate a horse. Horse taste good.
1	Pooped an apple then ate it. 10/10
1	elite game for elite gaymers like myself 10/10
1	SO FAR..... The fine detail graphics are VERY GRAINY. It's very difficult to read the stat and any text because it's so grainy. Gameplay is good. Crafting good. Inventory good. Controls are great! The toxic KoS is alive and well.
1	really good start
-1	Dayz Garbage
1	Good game for alpha if devs keep working it will be a great game
-1	no fun at all unless you like [did not find any think]. and that you can not just play with frend's.
1	 but I haven't encountered any yet. There is a bit of lag and desync which make shooting hard. Other than that the game is amazing.EDIT: Anti-Cheat has been added with the new patch"
-1	 I am glad that preorder wasn't an option.Refunded."
1	 likely the server."
1	 feeling sick. I should stay home n be a big scumbag."
1	 too slow to aim correctly."
1	Haven't seen the hard survival game like SCUM ages.
-1	Quite boring.. run to a high tier area get looted and sit there... boring
1	 which I'm sure will be a lot of fun.I should also mention that you can play deathmatch/team deathmatch modes rather than just doing the main survival mode if you're into that kind of thing!"
1	Some Bibba clapped my Cheeks with a pitchfork.10/10 Would Recommend
-1	 their servers cant contain combat. players would teleport across my screen with only a machete and kill me and take my 3 hours of loot."
-1	 THIS IS WORSE THAN MINECRAFT ALPHA VERSION SO BUGGY; THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED ON STEAM"
1	 not so much. Still want to be a woman though. Keep up the great work y'all and for y'all reading this. GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!"
1	One of the best open world survival games I have played in a long time.
1	This is what dayz should have been. Insane game 10/10
1	 a can of spaghetti and meatballs came out. I didn't know why but i think it was hiding in my good ol ""prison wallet"".  I got hungry and ate the can of spaghetti and meatballs.  10/10 i love this game."
1	Crushin brews and taking two's.
1	While pooping in the forest another random character came to me and peed on my face10/10 Would sh*t again in that place
1	 bang zombies. 10/10 best game ever"
-1	This game has a LOOOOOOT of work to be done before it should be considered playable. It should have been worked out far more than it is before going early access. Maybe after a few updates this might be playable but now... not at all.
1	 but has a TON of potential :)Do sth about the Cheaters and the thing that you drop your things in your hand when you use a tool with ""f"".  At least pop up a Message that u dropped your Weapon out of your hand. Would prevent a lot of frustration ... ^^"
1	Great game with huge potential.
1	 open for community feedback and skillfull enough to make this pearl to the best survival game"
-1	Game is Good but weapon loot is too low.I am looking for 3-4 hrs and no gun even small one.man we have a life we cant spend 6-10 hrs continue foe a decent loot.
1	 sometimes even multiple times in a day. Even on sunday. Unbelievable."
-1	 and lube up!"
1	 great execution and amazing potential in the future. It is definitely worth a shot."
1	A lot like dayzz but the little mechanics in this game make it much more interesting than dayz and also the combat in this game isn't aids like dayz
1	What DayZ:SA should have been + some interesting mechanics.
1	 already so much better than DayZ had promised it would become. And that in the early access phase."
1	good
-1	Looted for about an hour just to get randmoly shot through a wall due to the glitches xDJust needs some time to fix these things. Definetly see potential
1	 hope to see more updates soon"
1	 but there's a lot to love here and it will only get better (I hope)."
1	 check back again in the future. It definitely has a lot of potential and the devs are off to a good start so far."
1	 these people need to look through this and see the capability.It feels and plays great.Just buy!"
1	10/10
1	Great start to the game. Has a ton of potential. Ignore the 1 hour players. Those are review bots
1	 vehicles. and especially Dedicated servers."
1	 its a pretty good game especially for launch day. One thing though is it needs to get optimized soon. GTX 1080 after about 10-15 min of gameplay drops below 60 frames and does not go back up"
1	Good game. Memory leaks at the start. hopefully will fix itself in the coming weeks/months.
-1	bad frames too much info
1	 what about SCUM? If you don't like it now come back in 2-3 months. It'll be an epic game."
-1	Its Chinese scum hacking. Fix either those Chinese scums to be locked in their region or fix better anti-cheat.#RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina# RegionLockChina # RegionLockChina
1	 all in all the game feels great. The cool mechs make the looting even more intensiv!"
1	 you will know what to do."
1	Game full of cheaters ... Feels bad :/Game it self is grate do.
1	Verygood game
1	 you wont like this game. or maybe you will. just get good. other than the huge learning curve. put the hours in and this game will make u a happy person."
1	 but nothing serious. Definitely worth twenty bucks!"
1	 all good!"
1	 but worth the $20!!!"
-1	 can't get past start up screen without seeing fatal error and then game crashing"
1	 I wish it develops faster."
-1	 and obivously some anticheat. Don't recommend play at this stage."
1	fantastic for an EA game. a must buy. game has huge potential going forward
1	only 7 1/2 hours. Not much. But i can at least say the game is worth the $20 by far. Obviously the devs will further update the game to really define the best parts of the game itself. Personally i feel the Mechs are too underpowered.
1	its fun
1	Very detailed survival game.  I love how specific it is about the body function and nutritional needs.  Requires a lot of patients if you've never played this type of game before.
1	Violent pooping simulator.
1	69/69 i like this game v much :) feelsgoodman
-1	 and what is there is laggy and buggy.  Give it some time and it may mature into a game."
1	 I would love to see this game take the genre to the next level and add something like instances where you can make runs for rewards/ Loot and sort of move into a RPG survival game. but i guess we can just wait and see what the DEV's do. All and all its got a long way to go before its finished but i am excited to see where the game goes."
-1	Game always crash try reinstalling game now said message package corrupted. i want a refund or please solve the problem.
1	I have to say i like the game it feels like Rust with Zombies. I hope the game gets more content in single player or yes it does become a little boaring it could also have a little more teaching built into the gamr to learn how to craft stuff
1	You can poop on your dead enemies....and friends! poop/10
1	 some minor tweaks and additions should make this a real winner."
-1	 no complaints. The devs released a garbage game mechanic in their spawning system that makes solo play absolutely irrelevant and a waste of time. You can kill 2 players within 30 seconds of eachother and the first could spawn on their teammate in the same exact town as you within seconds. There is no balance between a solo player and a 2 man+ group. You could spend 8 hours owning everyone and a 2 man could respawn on eachother over and over again until they kill you by spending easily earned fame that they gained from killing zombies and baiting mechs. Until the game developers remove this trash mechanic of spawning on teammates without any sort of timer or combat detector the game is worthless to anybody who plans on playing solo."
-1	REEEEEFUUNDDDDDDD!!!!
-1	game is very unstable and feels unfinished in my opinion this game still should be in apha instead of early access dont get fooled by the streamers which have smooth 60 fps as theyre packing 1080ti etc this game is worse too run than pubg if i will see the game improve i will buy it again but as of current i wouldnt pay a single cent for it
1	has potentialbut with  700000 copys soldthats about 11753000 eurothey have to step it big up.
1	 also the map well done so much easier to play when i know im not running to nothingness.. cough day z cough... so yes defo worth the purchase"
1	 don't be like WildCard and PlayerUnknown. EDIT:(*)Memory leak seems to have been fixed.Keep up the good work SCUM devs!"
1	Did some lootingThe metabolism mechanics are awesome - really fun to monitor intake.Drank an entire bottle of absinthe and passed out.Currently sleeping in the middle of the road complaining that I'm hungry
-1	Got my refund!
1	I pooped on my mates butt when he was in  prone. Would sexually harasss again.
1	Best 20$ I've  ever spent
1	 it's showing a lot of potential."
-1	 But im sorry to say Guys It gets a huge thumbs down from me. Good luck with its future but i believe it wont have one. Buy Arma 3. or PUBG dont waste your money here Refund Me Please....."
1	diggin it so far
-1	 I truly hope I'm proven wrong."
1	 everyone has a fair chance if they know what to do! its all about knowledge!"
1	 but what's that!?Suddenly everything comes up and I start puking all over the place.*BANG!*Somebody shot me in the head.Would get shot in the head while puking again / 10"
-1	i had high hopes for it but it's like cancer for your computer
-1	game came out 1 hour late
1	A Mech Suit told me to leave the area and then open fired and almost killed me while I was attempting to leave. I came back and took a dump in front of the gate and left. I will never not love this game
1	help me fix my resolution it says its 1920x1080 and me recommended resolutionis 1920x1080 help fix please
1	Great game!
1	 but come back later once they implement a reason to play."
1	 or - if you so desire - go pssiing around :)"
1	Cool but need a lots of improvements
-1	pure kak
1	 the game is worth more than $20."
1	 the gunplay is pretty well pollished and the customisation looks to be amazing in the futre of you can make you char anything you wnt them to be a melle fighter a boxer a rifle man even a gun slinging pistol user. 8/10 will play again"
-1	 and thats if you don't die again by hackers.Avoid this at all costs."
1	 honestly its worth the 20$ don't listen to the negative reviews ( 100 x better then any others out )!"
1	10/10
-1	 and just so many disapointing mechanics missing or just not working."
-1	Played it for a short amount of time and actually loved it - my PC on the other hand had to go to rehab and get clean. Such a messy installation and the files are spread everywhere. Going to try again after the next update.
1	 getting chased by zombies then killed by a mech all with a AK with no ammo. FUN! Server needs to be improved 40 ping and get server spikes. Good FPS with a GTX 1050. I Think you have the top GPU you should be ok. Eats up a lot of resources due to my guess poor optizimation. But once optizimation and people with low spec computers complain. (I wonder if they will help low/medium specs users) I will really play this game non stop. (once cars are in)"
1	Good game
1	 but after a quick patch the game ran awesome. only bug i have experienced was zombies stacking and being pushed through walls. game overall is exciting and worth the 20 dollars i have paid. ignore the Thumbs Down reviews because they all are the same. Game is currently 0.1 dont expect a complete game.Will update every patch. Cheers and enjoy the Dayz Killer."
-1	Once Again Hype game same old shiz..... Just dayz again same clunkyness videos make it look 1000 times better than it is .. save your cash! just HYPE HYPE BS again...
1	The loading screen is already better than Dayz
1	 kudos!"
1	 thumbs down"" review sytem does not work here."
1	Meh. Probably gonna be another H1Z1. Hopfeully not.
-1	if they keep wiping server they arent going to have any players come launch date
1	  next to the camp fire where some horse meat is roasting and the amount of Brownwater that came out. That meat is not tainted but my bowel movement and poor decisions. Brownwater = Sh itt"
1	 i like it (:"
1	 and God bless SCUM (and the developers)For early access 9/10"
1	My friend and I were starving and looking for food.-Saw a boar and shot it.-Chopped it up into so many pieces of steak and fat-Ate a lot of steak and vomited.-Took a dump.-Ate more steak and fat-Vomited and took dumps for the next hour10/10 would pay to spend time taking dumps and vomiting in a game again
1	 I found a big suprise.I sh*t out a can of spagetti and meatballs........I proceeded to eat the spagetti and meatballs.The circle is complete."
-1	 maybe. DayZ knockoff with robots.  PVP is just as bad as dayz was in year 2 of development."
1	 they can shoot this game to the top."
1	 i've betrayed and i've pooped in unthinkable places. I rate it"
1	 zombies and random players to run across? Check check and checkity check!The development team has been truly killing it with listening to the community and pumping out rapid updates. This is a $60 game that's been marked $20 by accident! Cannot recommend this one enough."
1	 and nostalgic to the old Arma 2 DayZ mod days."
1	 DEVS! <3"
-1	stupid mechs crafting is boring too. i do not recommend at all. its stupid like the croatians"
1	 3 weeks without food is the way she goes devs."
1	.
1	 meds etc.  This is Survival!!!"
1	 which the DEVs seem to be good at putting out regular patches to solve.SCUM's worth a try if you're into the genre."
1	Very good game
1	 servers were stable for the majority of the evening and we've had great fun. Can't wait to see this game develop further!"
1	 thats pretty good!"
-1	"DON""T BUY YET !!!!!This scum  have sold their soul to g-portal.you are not allowed to host your own server and there is no coop....while it is under the game features on the steam store page .so if you want to play with friends now you need to rent an expensive server or otherwise you can get pvp't or you can loose all progress cause you played on a random server that can could be shut down cause the owner stopt its supscribtion...all other unreal engine based games like ark and conan give you the freedom to host your own game...... but the developer of scum thought they could get easy money through forcing us into subscribtions..shame because the game itself is actually pretty good and looks promising"
-1	 just not my thing."
1	 i would totally recommend this game if you like survival games and exploring"
1	 but it's working out great so far."
1	and some other minor issues. Overall I do not think you will get as bored as you will in DayZ but this is more fun to play with freinds. Overall I would recommend buying this game while it is still in early access."
1	 but it's incredible already. I had a blast and it's all I can think about right now.10/10 - would eat shrooms till I puke again."
1	 after that i puked on my poop and pee and i left the toilet completely ruined for the next Scumbag that comes along10/10"
1	a good time
1	 you buy! show the devs some support and talk about what you like and dont like because these B E A Utiful bastards listen"
1	This is the game we all wanted to play back in 2012. Better late than never i guess.
-1	 wait until they put some work into the game."
1	This game is very fun with friends a lot of activities but i would like more weapons and animals to hunt.
1	Not to compare at all with dayz .... dayz is the real OG ( original game ) of this game genre.Don`t @ me
-1	Great game but the mechs are broken. They see you through all objects and kill you through them constantly. I really enjoy the game but this breaks it.
1	 its definetly a game changer."
1	 but needs more content (obviously EA)"
1	 $19.99 is a great price for this innovative Survival game."
1	 but it need further updates on its optimizations."
-1	 and there's tons of major bugs which should be sorted out before an alpha-release."
1	 but I'll trust them to repair it."
1	Havent played too much yet but the game is great i would recommend it. It is really fun and not too hard but just right.
1	Don't buy it for PVP as dysnc is really bad but the survival aspect is good
1	 search for food and hope that there is an ammo in the box!Got used to the complex metabolism system after few hours.My fps is around 30 on gtx970m and i76700hq 24gbram with epic preset. On low preset 45+ but still under 50."
-1	 even a basic base building system. Refunded for now."
-1	 bus simulator seems like much funnier than this. You dont do anything but in BS2018 you can pickup people and drive! These robots in the secret areas in scum just shoot you for no reason. Also hosting a server with 60 slots cost like 55 USD ! The loading screen looks like it have been painted with paint on windowsThank you"
1	 also it lacks many features but as i said its very young. Howewer its really fun to play with friends."
1	 10/10 would play walking sim again"
1	 do that please! Fantastic experience playing this game even with fps drops and some lags. Game feels great and haven't played this kinda game since Dayz died. Fresh air in my fat belly. TY - BOOM!"
1	i think its a very good game to play with friends untill the servers get more populated but if i could ad one thing now it would be the ablity to cary dead bodies so you can get your loot if you have been shot by one of them scary robos i know you could or shouldnt be able to run full speed but it would be pretty nice also the ablity to see teammates on the map after adding them to squad. there is also a glich where if you sometimes drop items they go outside of the vacinity so you have to go hunting for them
1	 no graphic glitches no nothing  for all those who encounter low  FPS well just dont play  cool games like that on a gameboy :P"
1	 first of all i do have experience in survival games and i gotta say this game is better then average at the moment of developing. I had my first few hours now in Multiplayer and everything worked very well (minor lags but thats ok) .The understanding in how to craft and how to treat your health and food was a bit confusing but its understandable very quickly. I found some low tier rifles and many meele weapons what made it easy to not die instantly.  It is a young early acces title and you gotta treat it like that. I have some big hope in this game and i think it is a DayZ killer for sure. Lets wait and see what upcoming updates are going to bring into the game.Would recommend 5/7"
1	"Already better than the 5 year old early acces title ""DayZ""."
-1	boring after 10 minutes
-1	All the players are rubber banding and lagging
1	 I see no reason to believe they won't achieve greatness with SCUM."
-1	 not optimized well at all. Also gets very boring quickly. refunded!"
1	 looting towns for cooking supplies and fighting off other survivors."
1	Nice game !
-1	 etc)- creation of your character it's a JOKE!! Another 'immersive' experience.- no fast transportation option - so ou have to run/walk all over the map like a brainless bot. I love it!- NO co-op mode against environment!!! No free PvE mode!- to rent a server you have to pay 19 euro per month! Which is pathetic greedy.Verdict: just refunded"
1	Game is amazingly fun and devs  deserve all best :)
1	Good survival game.
1	 stabbing and bodily functions"
1	 since not that much content is available yet.Pace yourself if you like this game. Don't make it your primary game just yet."
1	 looting etc. but you have to take a look for your own char too. not like ""food and water thats it"". no you gotta find the right type of food to get minerals and vitamins.so for me 10/10 very good game"
1	A good game for its price but there  are alot of bugs well it is early access so we should complain that much the devs are trying the best to  fix them and it fun with friends :D
1	The game is already better then most survival games and it just released. That says some things
1	Good game!
1	 oh man... EVERYTHING DayZ was supposed to be. Been fun pretending to be a Negan/Rambo combo. GREAT game. Solid buy especially for the price."
1	only thing wrong with it is netcode like every other game
1	Few hours in. Deff worth the $ and runds decent for very Alpha.
1	Not bad
1	a true survival game.
1	 but there is also a lot of survival aspects you can do on your own in the woods. The map is quite large so don't expect to see anyone unless you go to a military base."
1	 najboljih 16 $ koje sam dao"
-1	 my mid range to slightly below midrange computer could not handle the game even at the lowest settings. Take my review with a grain of salt as I only managed to experience the game for less than 2 hours of stuttery gameplay. I can not recommend this game if you don't have a beefy computer or unless you are sure your rigg can handle it."
1	 hopfully the ad that in the future"
1	 not a PVP only game."
1	 further optimization.  I'm running the game on an i7 6700k with a 1080ti @ 1440p epic and getting 60fps."
-1	Devs think frying your CPU & GPU is a good thing. Buy this game if you want to cook an egg on your processor.
1	 and killed waves of zombies neither of those compare to the complete brutality of surviving the elements. All this being said i think scum has GREAT POTENTIAL and is definetely  going in the right direction. PS. it also seems like the DEVs really want this game to be good and have been working very hard into getting this game stable and closer to 1.0"
-1	 and if you look llike crap with a hangover you don't get on tv and say hey we're early release..."
-1	30 hours in GOODBeautiful game The basic mechanics of pve are great Vaulting and movement are good Looting is easy and intuitive BADPvp desync is horrible - every fight at range or not is a slideshow (this unfixed will be the reson for the biggest drop in players ) Once you have looted/geared up you want fights - but this is consistently the worse deysync ive seen in a game
1	 I'd pick it up so you can learn the game before more stuff is added. And It's only $20. So it Isn't expensive. Although who knows if that'll change."
1	 I cant wait to see how it evolves forward."
1	 buuuut i know the game is early access so the game neeed optimization.. 20 fps is not cool even on low hp (yes i have good pc)"
1	  and more content has come."
1	I ve accidentally change the resolution and cannot come back. any help?
1	HELLO!
-1	terrible optimization. 30fps ...
-1	 you're just like the others developers."
1	 this is what DayZ should have been 5 years ago. Amazing so far."
1	 found a cauliflower. Game completed. Didn't expect it to be over so soon!"
1	 you do it uncontrolably.  Its so realistic but still fun"

1	 just like DayZ but better and more complicated."
1	"walked down the road to find abandoned buildings with my buddy. Out of curiosity we checked them out and found some water. My friend yells at me that he got wacked by a shovel and so i run to him and i call out for the guy. The guy proceeds to act friendly with me and says he just hit a guy with a shovel but the guy ran away. I say ""oh we'll find him"" I go near the water fountain and act like im drinking and the guy pulls out his shovel to come and wack me. Too bad i was ready pull ouut my pitchfork and my friend jumps him from behind. we won that fight and ate his body. 10/10 would cannabilize again"
1	fun fun fun
1	 but i like.Great item of fun and play.I can has dlc?-Birch Swamp"
1	its bassically a PVE game since the map is so big and the servers only hold 64 people but its ok....
1	 general survival and crafting mechanics are amazing. And the best part is that its only in early access! Can't wait to see what else this game has in store for us in the future. If you had hope for Dayz and other games in the genre but are just generally disapotied  in the options out there then this is the game for you. This is what every survival game should have been from the start. Best $20 I have ever spend on a video game."
1	fun game but I would love to see them taking a look at server stabillity next to the (cheater problem) As it is now it is almost impossible to get a good shot on someone unless they stand still or you spray them down with an auto rifle.Other then that it is fun to play and cant wait to see the new stuff in the game.Would I recommend this game yea but obviously it is early acces and people should remember this when buying it !
1	 and it's only gonna get better from here as the Devs seem to be very involved in the community and pump out frequent updates and patch notes."
-1	Don't buy this game in its current state :Terrible FPSCombat is some of the worst I've seenMechs one shot
1	This is a great game! and I bought it right when it came out. I was expecting tons of bugs but it runned very well for early access im very excited to see where this game goes in the future !
1	7.2/10 Interesting game. Well optimized. Cool world to run around in. I made a video on how to play it on your Android devices if your interested. https://youtu.be/HZJk9OJJovQ
1	 and they still have a bunch of stuff not added in yet. I like this type of game and im excited to see where it goes from here. So far so good."
1	its not pooping if there's no poop.
1	10/10
1	 so..........."
1	high potential
-1	Remove the robots and the game will be much better :)
1	Great game!The only thing that is really crappy is the stuttering when encounter another player. Can't even fire a shot and I am dead...really frustrating. Please fix the server optimization.
1	 if there was a 1 min - 5 min delay depending on the amount of respawns on a squadmate in a certain amount of time this would not be a problem. This would make combat better when you dont have to constanty kill the same guy who keeps spawning to his squadmate who is camping behind a rock.-Comming from playing csgo for a few yeas the game feels a bit stiff to play but this is something i can get used to.-I dont know if a thing like this will work in the game but removing the sentries from the large military bases would turn them into high intensity combat areas where there is an even larger risk reward ration than right now with the sentries. If you manage to kill a player who has been there for some time and killed many people and looted he will drop large amounts of high tier loot. Staying longer means more better loot but a higher chance of bein killed in the process. Maybe this could be achieved with out removing the sentries im not sure but i think this has some potential.These few issues dont make me give this game a bad review but it keeps me from giving it 10/10 either. The core gameplay is great and with a few tweaks here and there this game will be a huge hit in the survival community"
1	This game is everything i asked for an more!! Completely trumps DayZ!
1	If you love survival games and have a one friend this is for you!
1	Every aspect of this game I had a problem with on my initial impression was solved by learning how to use in game mechanics. Everything is well thought out it's amazing. 10/10 worth the long wait. Good job!
1	lit af
1	 even with lack of content."
1	 and the devs seem to have a grasp on what the game SHOULD be. Can't wait for more content."
1	 and there have been daily patches. Has the makings to be the best survival sim yet!!"
1	SCUM + + + + + +Battlegrounds - - -Fortnite - -
1	 and there will obviously be more planned.-I ate a poisonous mushroom once and forced my character to vomit."
1	 better Dayz and its an EA"
1	 not to mention the Devs are staying in communication with the players. I'm excited for whats to come."
1	 needs to be cleaned and polished and only then will it shine!"
1	Its fun until a Mech with eyes on his back kills you in an instant and you have to restart and die because of a mech again or in a fight because of DESYNC
1	 long time."
1	 that IMO was a flaw on a game like H1Z1 where it was pretty much abandoned after PUBG came out."
1	 see how you feel after 1 1/2 hours and refund it if no likey . After 1 1/2 hours you should have a good idea as to whether you want to keep it or not"
-1	Dayz clone but worse.
1	 etc etc) but it does eat through your fame points quite a bit.. Great game! Friends and I are enjoying it greatly!"
-1	 if you like that you will love this game."
1	Most realistic poops in any video game ever. 10/10 would poop again!
-1	This game is great and has alot of potential..But in its current state I cannot recomend it because the performance is awful and it barely if at all lets you into multiplayer servers and if by a miracle you do connect their is a chance the game will just crash. I know i only have 59 mins in this game but 40 of those 59 mins was  me trying to connect to a server  with my friends so unless you have a god tier computer I suggest waiting a few months for the devs to improve the opdimize the game  before you spend your money on it
1	 this game has been out not even 30 hours from this review so give it a month max it will be more accessible for people that dont own insane computers i mean i have a RX 560 and it runs okay but crashes a lot so i say if you want to buy it to play straight away i would be honest with yourself and think if you could run it."
1	10/10.... got into a hostage situation with 3 others at the policestation a friend of mine with a draganov shot through the second floor window headshotting the armed attacker taking us hostage i was then able to pick up his gun and gun down his two friends... the only game where you dont ever want to die XD
1	bad but good
1	One of the best survaival game 2018.
1	So to get started I would say by far this is one of the most indeph and promising survival games that I have played. The graphics are suberb but more importantly the mechanics of the game are very good now and show promise for a whole new level of survival game there are some issues such as disconnects but those seem to be minimal for me at least and I had a issue with the anti cheat not letting me launch the game once but a simple verify of the files fixed that. Besides that the enemy's are so far ok the mechs are a nice change of pace for a game were evasion is your best option instead of just killing everything. Besides that if you enjoy a good survival game that is pretty unforgiving to say the least than you should buy it while its at a low price. Keep in mind though that this game is still in development and will probaly have many ups and downs before its released.
1	 i give it a 8.5/10 with the only cons being lag/lack of conent. Once this game has finally reached its end state I will undoubtedly drop a solid 10/10."
1	 it has it's faults like:-Optimiztion problems-Bugs-Character creator is not that good (for now)-Walking( A LOT)But they are going to add so many things and it's pretty good in it's current state!The survival game I had the most fun with and the most realistic game that I've played!"
-1	 the higher pop servers are unplayable right now due to players teleporting. I'm sure theyll get this figured out sooner or later. Netcode is absolutely trash in its current state."
1	 but the devs communicate well and are constantly adding new content and fixing issues. 8/10"
1	Everything about the core mechanics is solid. Two patches in a week and the devs are hard at work to bring vehicles and base building. I havent been so engulfed in a game and so excited for the next updates.
1	 AND it's in early access. 10/10 Probably the best game i have played to this date."
1	I skuanch this game
-1	Its really... really bad.
1	 but i am enjoying the game."
1	 if u just kill any animal u can carry its food cause its a 1x1 + u get 30+ pieces of meat that will last u WEEKS (not a joke btw) u need to just understand the game."
1	 I did not understand what this game had to offer."
1	 maybe wait a few days and see how they're handled."
1	Far better than any EA release. And by EA I mean Electronic Arts.
1	 like many others write a bad review which it doesn't deserve."
1	1.)please fix the camp and storage boxes. its always missing eventhough the logo is still there. (fix)2.)recently there are to many wall hacker on scum. its ridiculos to get shot thru the wall when u are standing still without making any movement.
1	poop sim but good
-1	 but as of currently I am giving this game a Negative on its review. Its still far too unplayable."
1	 but it's a good one bois. Better than DayZ and has a better edge with the setting of it. Don't add pets/taming/base building (fortifying will be dope). I'm all game for the development of this right now."
1	THEY LET YOU S@#$ ON YOUR FRIENDS 10/75.  Very cool game overall seriously.
-1	get rid of the zombies or i wont play this gamethe zombies in this game is too op they took a whole mag to kill or u need to land a headshot but when they are chasing u there is no way u can get a headshot and when there is 20 chasing u ur die stop tryingzombies in scum = tank in l4d2
1	Good for an early access survival game. Worth it is penny. Beware the drone that comes to kill you.
1	 or it's another restart. Remember this is early access and the whole point of playing it is to give feedback and improve what is already a Champion of a game. Great depth of information and stats. Good on you dev. team. Keep up the great work!"
1	 can't wait to see what comes."
1	 I would reccomend this game 100%."
1	 which hopefully are solved soon."
-1	 let's just hope it doesn't have to sit as long as DayZ..."
1	 and is a whole lot of fun with multiple friends.Rating: Currently - 9/10 Potential 1000/10.-"
-1	 until then....negative review stays."
1	 and that's about it. The game is pretty solid."
1	 survive."
1	"Best ""zombie survival"" game to date. The way this game plays with excellent gfx from a unknown dev is awesome. Leaps and bounds above any other game in the genre. Hopefully like with all EA game the devs keep updating and keep listening to the commmunity.  Completely worth the $20 usd."
-1	The game looks really nice and has a lot of potential. The big problem is that there currently is no anti-cheat system and cheaters are already appearing in the game. I'm refunding but may re-buy it when either the cheating is fixed or there is a decent PvE game option.
1	 you won't regret it!!!"
-1	(2HOURS PLAYED)Me and my friends was playing on an official sever. When we all died at the same time by a hacker!! I was really looking forward to this game. But i feel like it's like dayz...Not alot of loot and loads of hackers :(hopefully the devz will keep upgrading the game and making it better :)Then maybe i will purchase the game agen in the near future :)
1	 its dayz after 6 years on its first day."
1	Like dayz? Then 100% recommend. Really not bad for early access (besides the low fps) but has alot of potential.
1	 Im impressed of what have been achieved so far in Early access. Very stable so far. *Notes for the Devs: Keep in mind that the diversity of items is very low and the amount of loot  you can find in the world is very very scarse. I recommend improving that part as it makes the gamelpay tedious in that aspect. Looking forward to play SCUM for many years!"
1	OMG just love the game.
1	 recommend playing with friends.Game start might be a bit rough but once you get some inventory space you'll have a lot more fun.Hunting animals is intuitive.Stealth mechanics in military camps are fun and tense."
1	 making the game more stablea and squashing bugs!!!want to see more game mechanics implemented soon. keep up the good work!!!"
1	Still a good game runs way better now then it did the week of release the developers are nice people and listen to the community this game is living up to what I expected to be.
1	 being an owner of Dayz from the start this game comes face to face with it but knocked Dayz out simply because the Zombies are more optimized than a game that's been in development for 10 year! Hope to see this game progress into something wonderful and do everything others said they would do but couldn't deliver! on a side note I'm running the game on a dinosaur of a computer at the moment (not main rig) rocking 15- 20 fps on a GTX 460 lol. I was surprised it ran!"
1	 people are having a hard time connecting to severs and some can't even play the game. The server browser doesn't have a filter at this point. (Remember it is still in early access) Besides the very few issues with the initial launch of this game I do recommend purchasing and playing this game. It looks amazing and all the hype about this game probably being to advanced is not true. I find it exetremely easy to stay on top of taking care of my player.Take into consideration that the FPS in this game is F***ing S**t right now. If im on Epic Graphics Quality (20fps)If im on Low Graphics Quality (20fps)...so wtf am i supposed to do?"
-1	Meh
-1	 everyone buy insurgency sandstorm instead much better game in its beta stage. also i think that the new rocket league update that came out the same time and day was more of a success and has won me over than this pile of fungus that has been stepped on by the fat Scarce because no one likes the skinny one. over all i think that everyone who thinks this is a good game should be exiled to bloody hell bye and suck it JoshP ""this sh*t game rather play Dayz""*drops mic*"
-1	Way too many bugs
1	Very nice
-1	boring game.  I tried getting into this game but it wasnt what i was hopeing for. I hoped we could also build structures ingame but that isnt going to be a option.  I tried to get a refund but i coundt since i cant go over 2 hours of game play.  the game looks good but its just boring to me.  Maybe it will get some updates to make it more fun.
-1	 go outside and walk if you like to walk."
1	"One of the better survival games out there.But still pretty ""Early Access"" but fun."
-1	basically a rip off of dayz... in other words dont bother... id say alot of streamers were sponsored to play it even though most of them stated its wasnt sponsored
1	For a new alpha game this game is really smooth.Im sure it will be better in near future.You really need to play this game if you like survival games.
1	there is a guy that keeps stalking me and my pals with a black suit and flashlight XDDDD its scary af. Fun for all accept for squeekers
1	 thanks for this wonderful game"
-1	 on your own terms."
-1	 but I play most games on high if not Max. This game runs the same on all settings. It's just horribly optimized"
1	really good!
1	 not a DLC! Quite Like a much better DayZ.Please support the devs to fix Desync and hackers. Try to grab some friends as it is fun with them too!"
1	 buy it if you want to support a good survival game."
-1	 one of the worst games i've played. it's buggy in every aspect & full of cheaters. even the net code is so bad that PvP is a slideshow. 0/10"
1	 other game run perfectly fine on my potato pc but not this game lol"
-1	 because it doesnt have any vehicles yet. Bought it because it has potential."
1	Fantastic Landscapes.Pls fix stuttering <3
-1	I do recommend buying the game cause it does have a lot of potential but i do not recommend playing it at the moment unless you like dying to glitches :)
1	I like it!
1	 though it is hard to run!"
1	 while you learn the map and where to find certain types of loot.Overall this game is great so far but does need work. Ill update this review as best i can as patches are made."
1	The game has great potential!
1	This is what i do i sh%t on you
1	 $20 is a fair price for what content the devs have pushed out up until this point and a good investment for a game that will most likely get even better and rise in price."
1	Great game! It just came out and already better than DayZ in many aspects
1	Pretty decent so far and more to come.
1	Really fun and immersive game considering it is in early access. There is some desync issues in the servers with more players but other than that I have been having a great time. Can also pee and poop in the game. This is the future in gaming.
-1	At this time no.
1	 active devs updating the game 24/7 ! 8/10!"
1	 and it runs pretty smooth but it's trying to murder my GPU."
1	i like it
1	Very nice!
1	fun game. more survival than fps though
-1	 it might be worth picking up before they inevitably ramp up the price."
1	 frequent updates to issues people have before adding new content is a big plus for me. Interested to see what they will bring next."
-1	Nice Game for an early ! But G-portal ? WTF Why G-Portal for the hosting !!!!!! for now i will not recommend the game only because you are using G-portal server are so laggy
1	iz guud i like it
-1	ravioli ravioli. i couldn't open a can of ravioli
-1	I would definitely wait until this game makes some progress. It is very clunky and pretty barebones outside the usual military base and such that most of the DayZ players are accustomed to. As always just stay cautious of any Early-Access games including this one no matter the developer and development notes released.
1	Good but hard game :)
1	You can eat poisonous mushrooms without consequences10/10Edit: Watch out I was wrong
1	 one of the better games I've played this year. Buy it. Try it. Love it."
1	Best pooping simulator on the market tbh.
1	!!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!!
1	 the game also runs pretty good."
1	verry verry fun much shooty shooty havent been killed by human b is push to talk and only been sucked into wall once verry verry fun would buy again
1	 would I be happy playing it?The answer is yes. The games foundations are very solid. I'm looking foward to any additional content."
-1	Just another survival game.
-1	 45fps on low settings"
-1	Desync gave me cancer.. refunded for now!
-1	The person I played with was literally.
1	 very fun. Also how much money did the voice actor get paid to make the constipation noises?"
1	Not perfect but the team is putting effort into it!
-1	This game does not run. No menu. wait on buying
1	 the game will be great within a year"
-1	 but I wouldn't buy it the way it is now."
1	 its the ultimate hardcore survival game currently. Having a blast so far overall rating would be an 8/10 but it can improve through more updates and if they fix the d-sync."
1	i've played a lot of dayz. and this game adsolutely blows it out of the water!!!!it runs pretty well for early access and fps is good.
-1	 just go unconcious for a few seconds and wake back up under water."
1	 and above all that is cleans hacker and cheaters regularly and work with the community to improve the game.There is hope in this game."
1	 runs better than PUBG and looks at least 250x better to me.Can not wait to see this game to it's (hopefully) full release."
1	Best $20 i've spent on a game hands down.. Buy it to support the game and get your feet wet cause in 6 months this game will be amazing.. its early access so give the devs some feedback.
1	 devs attention to details on some points reaches high autistic levels!Recommend more than all battle-royale / survival games !!!"
-1	 thus making it unable for me to hit them.6/10 with potential to go up to a 8 or 9 out of 10."
1	 PUBG and Unturned."
-1	i would rather just play dayz because at least dayz is a lot less buggy. Its just another running simulator.
-1	na rate my review as funny please thank you!!!!
1	Super scum. Decent game.
1	 and watch it as it happens. The little scratch and sniff in the end is hilarious."
1	 one shot you and loot you. You can't even report enemys that hack or anything else...Cya"
-1	Got looted at airfield logged out next day logged in keep getting kicked from the server after 10 seconds of logging in
1	 wish they could be killed and looted though. Cant wait to see crafting and building."
1	miscreated and dayz had a kid
1	 and the player base will continue to grow."
-1	 rysen 5 and 1 ter hardrive and the fps drops make this game near unplayable any time any zombies are near. Player movement in general is almost more limited then the zombies which are near impossible to kill without a weapon or in large groups"
1	Stop... This is a game changing game. They are crafting a next gen experience here. It will take you 22 min to understand what they are doing here. Once you see this detailed and refreshing take on the survival game it's $22 cost is a deal. It is worth it.
1	Pooping is rewarding
1	 but you gifted me one of my best moments in gaming in months"
1	amazing game for just releasing defiantly needs more content and better loot tables. You search a whole village and get one piece of paper yet at airfield you get amazing loot which is good because high risk high reward but i should be able to comfortably get started lotting a big town. Besides this i love the game benn waiting for it for a long time and can see so much potential 10/10 would recommend with friends
1	 I would like to see current weapon ammo being given a server check if possible and maybe a moving too fast check to prevent teleporting.Still every game has issues at launch and the developers seem to be working to get anitcheat in and fix the issues so can't really give it a bad review just because of people who can't play without cheats."
1	It's a really good game but when it comes to combat its garbage i was fighting some guy and all of a sudden he turns invisible this really needs to be fixed
1	It's like DayZ and The Forest had a baby and I can cannibalize the poor players that wandered into the wrong building to scavange.
-1	 this game is for you."
1	this game is awsome i would buy it again ;)
1	i like
1	 considering it takes ages to level up the skills."
1	 so that's great and I changed the recommend. As long as the rest of the bugs are fixed eventually."
1	 and uncertainty no game has ever shoved against my face before. There is so much to cover in this game that I honestly feel like any review that I can write wont be enough.6.8/10 I urge you to give this a try."
1	I hope to resolve the server lag as soon as possible
-1	The most shallow game masquerading as a 'deep and thoughtful survival game'
1	Dont let the time fool you.. ive been playing the early alpha and beta.. This game is amazing.. clearly at the time being you make your own fun but if you have any kinda imagination and you like this genre.. this game is for you! Dont let the stupid negative reviews fool you.. ITS THE FIRST DAY some servers are a lil overloaded but theres 100s of servers that are fine. if you like dayz you will love this. These devs care unlike so many others..
1	 this is quite acceptable. Looking forward to further patches and seeing this game improve and grow!"
-1	Early access really is a plague on the gaming world
1	 they have to optimize it and fix it.Do not buy for now."
1	 they said they are fixing the servers and the lags. this is day 1 of launch. i support it"
-1	 but then it's still just a nice looking version of many other Zombie servival games.  Can't honestly recommend at this point."
1	AWSM game but low fps.
1	 but other than that its okay."
1	made by gamers for gamersscum is an epic game for the best gamers. robots pwn the noobs its epic. haters gonna hate...
1	best $9.00 game purchase ever.
-1	 but if i'm being honest you'd get much better value from that game. I predict the roleplayers will take this game over in the future."
1	 in a 25 person server bc map is so huge. But so far the ones I have come upon are funny and helpful.Great survival/fps/exploration/ hybridGet it"
1	 east to pick up and understand. So far its not cancer like some of the other titles in the genre."
1	FPS 17
-1	 but that's only if this goes anywhere."
-1	Another awful early access indie game
1	good so far and the skill system is good
-1	 game runs poor & no loot and laggy servers.RefundedR.I.P"
1	 but also a few out in the forest.The sound is a little funky. I can hear water when im in the middle of the forest but there isnt nay water or rain nearby. Its early development so Im keeping an open mind. I hope this game becomes something big. Keep up the good work guys!"
1	 and whatever else they plan to add a PVE element.CONS:Now there is only really one major con that I have. And that is the performance. It would run smoothly but every now and again it would hiccup and freeze my game for a few seconds. One time before I got off It froze for a good 30 seconds. But hopefully that is fixed in the future. Other than that pretty much what I expected which is a great thing."
1	very good game i highly recommend for everyone i really im in love with it thank you sooo much devs <3
1	 can't wait to see what it becomes over time. (Will edit as more features get released)"
-1	I really had high hopes for this game but this game has problems off the rip.The servers don't work and the game isn't optimized and also why do you need to make a new charectar everytime you try to join a server that doesn't even work.
1	Just pooped out an apple. Not hungry anymore. 10/10
1	 but needs some better servers and i guess a better netcode"
1	By far the best game I've played in a long time! The game I've always wanted since 2013! Fresh new elements and beautiful sceneryI could survive and roam for hours and enjoy this game immensely!
1	 but for what it's worth definitely recommend."
1	Bring back the Neo Nazi Tattos brings a sense of realism and showing that these are terrible people and are actually SCUM of the earth
-1	 severely disappointed"
-1	i know its new but it shouldn't lag like this .. as for the pack .. when u pee or poop ur underwear is still on reguardless"
1	good
1	 Please Dev: Add Weed in the game like we can cultivate and with effect on metabolism PLEASE"
1	noice
1	 the concept is certainly cool but spwning using fame points is a bit odd."
1	 solid game so far. Great PvE Survival game at the moment. Once they fix the server/client side issues than it should be a fantastic PvP game as well."
1	Drunk tow bottles of whiskey in 10 mins. Passed out after 10-15 minutes later and was not able to get up. Went to main menu character was lying on the ground near campfire totally drunk. 10/10
1	Pooping with strangers
-1	 but crashes computer when joining server game. I've tried several fixes but nothing works. Refunding."
1	Its amazing but they need to add cars and fast.
1	 only that this game rocks!"
1	It's fun. Just buy it. It'll get better. It's only 20 bucks you loser.
1	First time i bought it i played only this and now i cant play other games this game so good w/ good devslooking forward for this game :)
1	Early Access games with developers that actually listen and work around the clock (as least for the moment) to keep players happy.Really enjoying this game and I think it has something for everyone. It's the best blend of all good shooters and survival games.Check it out!
-1	 just everything is wack. if they add in a base building mechanic or something maybe I'd come back but all in all it kinda sucks."
1	 best game I've played for a long time"
1	 and surely the game can only get better as it is updated."
-1	Cannot connect to god damn server do somthing
1	 expect to log the hours that will give me my $20 of entertainment by far."
-1	 unfortunately I can't connect to any servers and when I play on single player my game keeps crashing. Currently I would say this game is badly optimised. Wait until a patch has fixed these issues and postpone your buy."
1	 just randomly being killed by someone in the middle of nowhere"
1	Play SCUM if you want to know what DayZ will look like in 35 years.
1	Grinded for 10 Hours.Looting...One bullet to the head...All that work gone.*pepe hands*
1	 don't bother."
1	prisoner leave this area
1	 DayZ truly BTFO within the year."
1	this game is pretty good..it has a large open world on my server i am yet to see anyone there are some flaws. but it can be enjoyable..if i knew the point of this game it might be better. the object of the game is to survive but all you really have to do is hit up an army barracks and load up on guns and ammo then sit in the woods and you're pretty much safe. im yet to see the multi-player stuff since no-one is online on my realm ever either that or they dont talk. doesnt matter this game is better solo for me imo. if i knew how to go about the object of this game id have something to do in it. but as of right now my guy is easily surviving doing absoilutely nothing. hes camped out on a farm with plenty of food and ammo:) no zombies aka survivn'
-1	 Still absolutely trash"
1	An amazing take on the survival genre. Recommend 10/10
-1	Laggy mess with no content just wait for updates
1	 the games been out for 3 days and the devs have already released 3 updates to fix some of the game breaking bugs. This game has amazing potential!"
1	 128ppl servers."
-1	Very unstable in it's current form. It has potential but I think this was released too early into early access. Perhaps the funds raised through early access can speed up development.
-1	 they are always quick to remind me."
1	Game needs a lot of work and love but its a solid foundation for the devs to build on.You like long walks in the forest with your friends and no action happening for hours?Like running for 20 minutes only to get one-tapped by a mech?Over all survival fan? Then you will like this game.
1	 game worth  buying."
1	 and it is very fun to play"
-1	I want my money back.
-1	 EXTREMELY TOXIC community on these servers."
1	Amazing game so far really like the hardcore survival aspect to it i just dislike the pvp junkies that constantly sprints wasting all their precious calories and energy so they can quote get sum pvp action. game is a Masterpeice keep adding pve aspects please.
1	 you have to think about what youre doing and time your movements. Zombies are buggy and are basically smaller gun-less robots.The crafting is very nice and can be built upon.Only found the same 5-ish guns.Can get laggy at points.I think its a good game and would warrent at its current state a 7/10. 07/09/18"
1	 I'm really enjoying this game so far and I really hope it gets less shallow. I can only walk around the woods and towns for so long without true purpose. Thumbs up"
1	 I can see this game having a really bright future."
1	 just waiting for the servers to be fixed and add vehicles lol"
1	It looks like a good game but it's the HARDEST GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS... MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 5.
-1	TAB key does not work... cant pee... cant poop... kinda frustrating...
1	Best DayZ since DayZ came out
-1	 basically once you have a gun and good loot there is nothing to do but run around looking for people who are worse off than you. There is no way to win anything but periodic satisfaction after destroying the occasional zombie horde. On top of it all this game performs so poorly on my system that even the menu gave me 30fps. If this was a beta and not a $20.00 Game my review would be more forgiving. However in it's current state this is worth no more than $5.00."
1	 dont allow ne bases just make the houses available for base building..."
1	waiting on updates...
-1	RUN!BLEED!DIE!and cycle goes on.....
1	"Let me tell you about my experience with scum.                 Here is my scummy story As me and my 2 friends met up after a lonely lord of the rings journey from across the map we couldnt be more happy to have met up with eachother at the farm in the middle of no where. My two friends found an egg each to eat. I did not. This egg was discovered to have a magical bug that made it never disappear. (Now fixed) for 3 hours every time my buddys ate this magical egg I had to hear about how amazing it was. How lucky they are. How I'm a piece of s**** because I dont have a magical egg.... as I'm sure you can tell.... man was I sad. But i realized right before we decided to clear out some zombies in front of a town. Wait.... this is a survival simulator. Eating an egg constantly for hours cant be good for your health... "" hey boys.... the egg is cool and all but you may want to check your stats"" (zombies getting closer) friend 1 ""omg my sodium level is 1000%""Friend 2 ""wait mine is to!"" (Zombies attack) As we fight the lighting fast 5ft leaping zombies I watched as my 2 friends were forced to stop swinging there melee weapons.... pull down there pants.... and spray diareahha while zombies pummeled them.... LITTERALLY SPRAYING liquid s**** with force out of there a**. Never have I seen anything like this in my life. We all died laughing... and I mean actually died in game.  The moral of the story is. First off.... dont only eat eggs. You will s*** yourself. Second is yes in EA there is bugs. Some more annoying then others. But the dev's pump the patches out. And this game is what you make it. Go out. Go on an adventure. And let game unfold. Its 100% worth the money just for watching my a**hole friends crap there pants. Give it a buy. Well done devs. This is what us survival folks really needed. And bravo on implementing legitamit diareahha."
1	 game seems great could just use some work get its early access but fix it fast or end up like H1Z1."
1	 it's just not worth buying right now until they have some basic cheater mitigations in place."
1	 god lord that zombie fat tastes so good :)"
1	DayZ killer
1	 all around perfect launch."
-1	is ok
1	whats up with the servers
-1	Server browser is from 1995ez refund
1	SCUM is a promising survival game which introduces lots of new mechanics for more realism. At first glance it may look similar to DayZ but imho it has a lot more depth and cool features. Try it out! 10/10 would recommend
-1	 its clear the comunity is hyped up so lets keep it going and get some objective markers on that map and please.. a story."
1	 and should probably research what it means when games are in alpha."
-1	 you will probably have to find a clip to put the ammo in first so uhh. Good luck."
1	So the game is good but some lag here and there not to bad.... They need to add more loot!! To many things out there that want to hurt you!!
