label	review
1	This Game is Sooo GOOD. It the 1st of its kind that ive played and im loving it.. The Game stole my whole day and night. time flew. its going to be the best of its kind.....
1	Pretty fun game. Good launch. Yes there aren't an incredible amount of features in the game but then again it's early access. If the devs keep this up it'll be the DayZ we all wanted. But better.
1	 and know what your expectations should be and you will enjoy your $20."
1	 just like any EA game.- UI feels outdated.Honestly that's all I can think of. I've spent 17.4 hours in the game at the time of this review and it's been out for two days. I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take the game!"
-1	the fact that you cant go get your loot after you die makes this game so dumb im almost done playing it its so annoying to have to restart because of a robot shooting you through a wall and killing you in 1 shot when you have full military gear
1	A lot of people are complainng about this game but they don't understand that it's EARLY ACCESS. For an early access game this is a fantastic game! Very detailed and fun to play.  I haven't played this game with friends yet but i'm sure when I do it will be a blast. There's a small bug here and there but that part of it in this stage of the game. This is way better than I expected it to be.
-1	at this stage with no base building and no vehicles and no npcs to fight its just get stuff you dont need to shoot people with no goal in mind theres like 5 guns and 2 can have sights 3 are iron sights only so as of now they put the game out that becomes stale quik because of lack of content esp for the amount of time they have had to hype it up so for me scum is boring oh and the bear helmet looks like a mascot head not like the one in the video .....oh yeah and no disease or sickness amd a very big unexplained learning curve for nutrition that doesnt make any difference when it comes to the only goal which is shoot anyone. Get it together scum
1	ADD EXTRA THINGS IN GAME AND MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND BULLETS AND FOOD
1	Super fun game. But its still kinda buggy since its still early access but atleast the devs are doing updates often.
1	 must grow more with people support it have great future lets hope dont end like day z..."
1	good
1	its the best in its genre.also give croteam money.
1	buy now it good game yesssssssssssssssssssss
-1	Fights are basicly ice skiing around with heavy de-sync also after dying your hunger remains so next life you remain starving. I love the depth of the systems but this game is not early access ready.
1	 as it is currently I recommend to buy. The only problem is that the servers have been overloaded today but recently they threw out a patch and I dont have any problems now.Ignore the negative reviews they are there mostly because of server issues"
1	Online teleport simulatorWilling to teleport again!
-1	 but running around the woods to find a new hoodie isn't what i'm looking for"
-1	 needs more action and less crafting."
-1	thank you"
1	 weapons and vehicles... but it's totally worth $20!"
1	 died and raged."
1	 I havent experienced a lot of the content yet so I may edit :) definitely recommend as I am excited to see what the devs bring in future updates"
-1	 you can kill zombies but what's the fun in that i can do that in any other game and have fun doing it. honestly if you are going to make an abitious game like this and you want to showcase what the game offers don't throw out a halfbaked idea that leaves your player base with nothing to do. yes realise it is early access but that is no excuse for charging people to play it with no real meat to offer. If i had to compare this game to something i would compare it to agar.io get points become powerful until you die then start over. i.e not fun"
1	shot 5 shells at a puppet had to kill it with spears instead 11/10
1	 and the long distance water graphical glitches (bright flashes and flickering).  Up close the water reflections look utterly mesmerizing but farther away than 15 meters they dissapear and are replaced by empty flashing.  This is really the only significant problem for me with the game right now.  Once this is fixed the visuals in this game will be flawless and stunning.  FInal Thoughts: Breath of fresh air.  Have not been this excited about a game in quite a while.  Takes the open world survival multiplayerish genre to a whole other level.  Gameplay feels polished.  Once the graphical glitches are fixed (possibly an amd thing?) and performance issues are fixed this will be one of the best games on steam.  Absolutely stunning visuals. Support these developers so they can fix stuff and add content."
-1	 or find some that you trust and that isn't full."
1	Add to cart
1	Good
1	its an early access game. itll have its quirks. overall this game has plenty of potential and its worth dealing with a few bugs on launch day. i would 100% reccommend getting this game
1	 but the devs are great and fixed launch issues within 2 hours. Game mechanics and what not are amazing it is what dayz wanted to be but better."
1	 solid and promising early access game."
1	Not to bad of a game once you get use to the game mechanics. Made my guy poop and a choco bar came out. So of course I ate it lol.
-1	 but I'm not struggline that bad and am a total newb at these types of games.First guy I met in the game killed me with a spear from behing. The next I met was a couple people in a city and they were all really friendly and helpful.This game is TOTALLY WORTH the 20 bucks it costs right now."
1	pretty good early access
1	This game is everything DayZ was supposed to be. 10/10.
1	 you won't regret it."
-1	it will be die like dayz
1	My friend told me i could throw melee weapons. I spent 3 chasing a deer that just so happened to have my axe stuck in it. 8/10.
1	Cant wait to see what come in the future
1	 I really enjoy playing it even in it's current state. highly reccomend for any fans of the hardcore survival genre!!!!!"
-1	 repeat. no objective or anything. Refunded. Just bought it again f  uck it dude"
1	AWESOME GAME!!!!  Big like for everything :D :D :D
-1	this game trash. the geme is trash. save som money and dont buy it
1	10\10 LOVE this game worth every penny
1	 but overhaul for its early access status its pretty good. Can/t wait to see the futur update."
1	 even though the trailer kinda suggests its. Reminds me of the first few months of DayZ on ARMA2 but with better features. Really scratches that nostalgia itch."
1	Here is the DayZ without dumbed down that we all have been waiting for!
-1	A slighty better version of DAYZ. Great concept and as of right now thats all it is a concept. No real goal hinder it. Robots and loot site make it three times harder to get loot.
1	Day Z and batleground is dead :) 16.99 price is too cheap this game now worths like 40 eur :)"
1	 but IT'S EARLY ACCESS so everyone crying about that stuff needs to stop. They are releasing updates and fixing things! Bottom line it's worth $20. (:"
-1	 definately do not recommend at all."
1	 trip alarm"
1	 and the developers are very involved.10/10"
1	 when ever i try to kook in my invantory i get the taunt menu. i also do not like to HAVE to use brake fluid to start a fire. if you try to place a pistal and a bayonet next to each other it does not work. i recomend a helicopter for one of the vehicles in the future. and thanks for a great game!"
1	 WTFFF?"
1	 etc. however the player base just seems kinda laggy. I get it. game just came out. but still its a bit strange to see such ""lag"" i guess i could say in other players.There are some other things wrong with the game but a lot of rights. For a game that just came out I really do think it's headed in the right path. I just hope that the devs can really take into consideration the food issue and maybe a friend system. Other than that I really do love the game and what it has to offer."
1	 just get it. side note: the concurrent player count is growing like crazy."
1	 and hardworking. Definately a promising game. Given its current price at only 20$ USD I would say you're missing out if you dont give it a try."
1	80+ hours and still not bored yet!!  I hope people can just see past these REEE comments and have fun with what is here because this game for an initial showcase of what it is has really impressed me. Week 1 and I don't think there dev team have even slept yet the patches / fixes keep pouring in. there all over the steam forums taking on board what the community is saying / reporting and there acting on it almost hourly its crazy. I have not seen one negative remark from them either really good team and a legendary product. Seriously get this game stay open minded its an alpha get past the initial learning curve and get in there and see what you are made of. Well worth the the price tag support these devs this game has so much to offer and so far its delivering every day.
-1	This game is trash - Save yourself $20.
1	buy it 100% worth it
1	 game has potential."
1	 i like the sound in this game it is so real.Please put in this game that i can be girl.!!"
1	Better than Dayz
1	(y)
-1	Best running simulator on steam 10/10
-1	 base building and readily available food/water"
-1	 dont waste $20."
1	 for an early access game i give it an B-. Reason i gave B- because theres not many guidelines just yet for the game"
1	The game is like half off my screen and i can't fix it lol
1	I think this game has great potential and honestly its beautiful. I just hope people remember that it is Early Access with 16 ppl making this game. This has given a great survival immersive game. Paid for standard version at first and have played now in only two days 25 hours and was happy to upgrade to the suporter dlc to help give that extra $$$
-1	 then I dont think it is worth the 20 bucks."
-1	robot stealth simulator
-1	 everyhting is to far apart. wait for a bunch of updates before you buy this"
1	 can ya'll go over and give Bohemia Interactive a hand with DayZ?"
1	 but the devs are well aware of this and are most likely working on it right now.If you want to follow the devopement of the game you can check out their website https://scumgame.com/en follow them on twitter https://twitter.com/ScumGame or watch livestreams on twitch. They only post major updates on the website and smaller updates og Twitter. On twitch you can watch how gameplay progresses and improves over time. One day you might be watching a streamer PVP'ing without any networking issues and so on."
-1	Hot Trash
1	 but when it goes through multiple floors I feel like there should be a way you can get off on a floor and not have gravity push you all the way down. Other than that. Man this game is great and we instantly loved it!"
-1	 no content. Another walking simulator."
-1	No.
1	 could be a 10/10 if the devs fix the dsync and frame drop."
-1	 I wont be able to recommend this game to anyone who has interests in doing anything outside of shoot on sight pvp."
-1	DONT GET IT UNTIL SERVER PERFROMANCE IMPROVES!!!!!
1	 the map is very big and takes ages to find anyone.memory leaks after a few hours"
1	 I didn't attempt to solve any of the problems i have stated. i just want this game to be good for the developers and the community.Thank you"
1	It blows my mind that this has any negative reviews. It is everything we wanted from DayZ and all the things we didn't know we wanted.An absolute steal for 20 dollars.
1	 best meat ever10/10 would kill person and eat again"
-1	...
-1	Remove the robots = positive review
1	 still dying before meeting up with friends and then running across the whole map10/10 best spent 20 bucks on steam"
1	 needs a bit more content to really be great"
1	 I got 100 hours of running its enough for me..."
-1	 cuz this is the time you need to find any weapons. Even as a free to play title this game would be to expensive."
1	 but even with the few of us we have  a blast. Trying to sneak past mechs into a military base for that good loot is exilirating. I hope that the developers continue what they have been doing and take this game to new heights. Hopefully soon they will include a bicycle or perhaps tameable horse to ride to get around the map easier. Other than that it's a very enjoyable and highly realistic survival/apocalypse simulator."
1	 but nothing to really do after you find all the best gear. You just wander around and avoid being killed after that. No real goal."
1	10/10 would recommend!Here in voice chat as I'm running. COME BACK DUDE LEMME F YOU.F = Add player to squad!LMAO
-1	!DISCLAIMER SCUM FANBOYS TRIGGER WARNING!Basically this game is DayZ Standalone at its prime but will die eventually if the Developers will not give the consumers what they want the most e.g. BASE BUILDING/FORTIFICATION and VEHICLES. Right now there is no end game which just resolves in getting absolutely geard and PVPing other players BUT....... WE HAVE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN look at how DayZ Standalone has turned out to be and it scares me to see another game like this that has MASSIVE POTENTIAL. Like come on this is 2018 we shouldnt be getting something like this which is a repeat. I just hope the developers have learned from DayZ Standalone's Mistake
-1	Melee combat is f*cking sh!t5/10
-1	 there's no search option. Trying to find the servers through the time option or players tab doesn't work because there's over 3k servers and they all are trying to load at once and it will overtake the other ones and make the one you were looking at go all the way to the bottom. This is the type of game I only play with friends so when we're walking around doing nothing it's not as boring. So not having a good way to join friends is a big no no for me."
1	 etc."
1	 there is no thirst. There is only salt."
1	 the metabolism page is really good and i like how you have to watch what you eat so you can optimize how your character plays. It does take time trying to cross the map to find your group but hopefully they'll add vehicles. Its a great looking game and hopefully there will be some more content added soon."
1	 I was pretty happy to see the state of this game when it launched and all the support the devs have been giving it. It's nice to see a developer who actually listens to community feedback this well. Recommended if you like sadistically torturing other players or if you've always wanted to have explosive diarrhea in a video game."
-1	badly broken game.
1	 let it mature for a bit and see if it improves."
1	Very fun game its a much better Dayz and is still early in dev this game is amazing for the current state of the game
-1	The gameplay is legit too realistic.its more of a survival game than anything else. So the game can be boring for a good portion of people.thats why i wouldnt recommend it to mors of people.
1	pls fix FPS Drops
1	 the Dev's seem commited and I really recommend this EA title!!!"
-1	Fix the disconnecting and the optimization and I'll buy it again.
-1	not what it seems like literally minecraft and pubg put together
1	Really cool sandbox game!! highly recommend it!
-1	It's just boring and poorly optimized.
-1	wow. This game is trash.
1	YOU CAN PEE ON DEAD BODY.     10/10
1	better than dayz? maybe they sure made a really complicated system work pretty damn well. GET ON THE EVENTS GUYS! try it out for 20 bucks its the best survival game you can buy that has not been in EA for 5 years ;)
1	best survaving game ever
1	 but you guys seem to be on top of trying to fix it..."
-1	 there is absoultely nothing to do good luck even finding anyone when youre actually looted oh and dont even think of storing your items anywhere  because theyll just disappear which goes back to the point im making its a huge waste of time"
1	 and otherwise a good game to start off with."
1	has a lot of potential! cant wait to see what they do. the dayz killer! if dayz wasnt already dead
1	really fun game
-1	 you kill players and die in horible ways but you won't show a bum in an animation while squeezing one off or a peen and balls when you take a whizz. Hey everyone loves the hillarity of it but you got to commit. lazy.Wait a few years for the game to develop into a game worth buying because as of now its got nothing to keep me playing. xoxo gossip girl."
-1	 causing massive lag."
1	Amazing game so far in its early state. Great job by the devs. I can't wait for the day where people understand the point of early access. To continue to see complaints of an unfinished game is both juvenile and ignorrant.
-1	 occasionally freezes and even when running at its ""best"" just looks off? Like constant minor screen tearing."
-1	 tedious crafting. Bad game."
1	 I would consider this game worth 20 dollars!"
1	A pretty standard Day Z clone with some new features.  You actually have to use your brain guys.
1	 see you on there!"
-1	 even with all the features they want to implement I dont see this going anywhere."
1	fun game consant fps drops made it unplayable thoe
1	 people need to cut the devs some slack and give them time to fix the server issues and crack on with adding in all the missing features. If they keep up at the pace they have been going it will end up being a really decent game."
-1	Fix the mechs and maybe we'll talk.
1	 not to mention everything planned for v1.0 and beyond."
1	This game is great and you should give it a try! who wouldn't want to squeez the lemon in the forest and take solid dumps! 10/10 IGN But seriously though try it. Obviously it has a few bugs and missing content but it's in alpha so what can you expect. In my opinion RIP Dayz.
1	 also the fact it just hit early accessAlso not everyone alive in a server needs to die remember that.Its 20$ currently I say honestly give it a shot."
1	 will update this review once I've played it longer."
1	rust and other survival games."
1	Flawless.
1	HYPE HYPE HYPE!
1	Very impressed with the EA release. For 20$ this is worth it.
-1	 or the players. You just run around aimlessly collecting loot you cant actually carry around with you.I would hold off on buying this game till one or two content/gameplay updates are released."
1	 which is already my money's worth. $20 for 2 hours of entertainment is more than I usually get. This one is promising and I don't believe it's another DayZ clone cash grab. Please don't break my heart devs. <3"
1	Gamepires & Croteam just took ownership of the entire survival genre.
-1	 maybe it will be a great game sometime later down the line."
-1	 not to mention the lootfest that this game is.And after gathering all the loot you can and getting geared up to the max there is not much else left to do other than searching for other players on the massive empty map and trying to shoot them while they rubberband across your screen."
-1	'scum could not load your proffile'
1	 or more realistic than it needs to be. Remember that first and foremost this is a game! We need to keep having fun to keep playing it!"
1	 however this game is extremely well balanced for its state. For $20 you cant really complain."
1	The game is great. True zombie survival. Very advanced gameplay and lots of action. This game will go far if the project is not abandoned like Day-Z. Server rental is quick and easy. Grab a few friends and get ready to have some hardcore survival fun!
-1	 so I wouldn't be surprised if it did."
-1	   03.9.2018."
1	Love this game. IF you enjoy survival games I'd highly reccomend.
1	 doing this helped decrease stuttering and smoothed it out. I'm getting 48-60 fps with Res at 70 on Med / High graphic settings"
1	 a little but it showed me how powerful the mechs really are but the risk reward is worth it. This game had a way better launch than dayz and it seems like its gonna be great with allthe crafting you can do. I can see it now in the future with base building rp servers and cars armored up with roof panels. This game gives me the enjoyment of back when i was playing dayz mod origins. And i will continue supporting this game."
1	 and a little over-bearing for what I think the game should be6/10 While in betaWorth the price and hopefully gets alot of support."
1	 shot me down I had 30% HP left.10. Stop reading and buy this damn game <3"
1	My new favorite survival game
-1	when i want to create a character i can't press the create button please help !!!
-1	It is like DayZ had a baby......and then took a dump on it
1	 would recommend for people that like a more hardcore experience."
1	I play Scum because Im Scum
1	 I suggest you go look up gameplay and see for yourself how you feel because you might be pleasantly suprised.-EDIT: I played on a multiplayer server... yeah I don't see all the whining. I had minor amounts of lag but nothing to terrible."
1	 dawg- Randy Jackson"
-1	very bare bones runs great not alot to do super clunky UI lot of open land scape with poorly constructed POIs crappiest servers ive seen since pubg literally nothing to do in its current state has a long long way to go hopefully these devs dont abandon it and it becomes something cause its got monster potential but thats all it has is potential at this cureent moment
-1	 this game is for you."
1	 I really enjoy the vibe (its already better than Dayz.) 6.5/10"
-1	The game is just boring ! maybe it's good maybe bad idk it's just not my cup of tea! i got in looted for a long time then got killed then respawned with no loot looted again then got killed idk what's the point of the game there is absolutly no goal! I guess im refunding
1	So far so good. If you liked Day Z I would seriously recommend picking this up. Only issue I have had so far is some optimization issues. Occasionally I will drop down to 40Fps from 60. This is on Medium Settings with a 1060 and Ryzen 3 1200. Will update review when I have more time with game.
1	Beware the big scary robots their mean
1	 Crafting feels good great game so far.."
-1	 then suddenly while being in the middle of the Airfield i got all my gear wiped away while still being chased by muppets. As long as stuff like that happens i cannot recommend this game. Still has alot of potential."
1	 running quite well for an alpha game and graphics are quite good."
1	 with nice graphics and sounds!Buy it and have fun!"
1	 not like others out there."
-1	 so if you loot real good a lagging russian player can easily kill you with a freaking crowbar no matters if you rain your bullets on him it not registers bc of lags and bugs of this game and that ruins fun of the game."
1	more than worth its price
-1	 and thats pretty f-ing bad."
1	 best early access game in a long time. Think DayZ + H1Z1 + real life."
1	 then you will like this game."
1	 10/10"
-1	Ok so there is a few major problems with this game that i feel like everyone should be aware of. there is a major memory leak you can only play for an hour or 2 without your frames going to 10 and you needing to reopen the game. along with the looting system wich is also broken you can only find weapons and ammo that are usefull in military bases. that are overun with players since there is only like 15 of them and 64 players in a server so there is never any loot in the bases and if there is good luck getting past the mechs that can snipe you down even if they see so much as a toenail off your body. so as of right now i would deffinetly not reccomend this game to anyone. buy a game like miscreated were atleast the looting works and the map is overun with loot in any type of house.
1	 but i'm sure it will reach 8 and 9 as time goes by."
1	Diarrhea is awesome 10/10
1	SCUM looks really beautiful and runs very good even though it's an early access game. I hope the dev team make SCUM a game that DayZ couldn't be and add the content they promised they would add. Check it out when it's still 20 bucks because it's really worth it.
1	 and buy it."
-1	broken server list wouldnt show up dont buy until fixed
1	 the world looks beautiful even on low settings and in 10 hours I haven't run into any major bugs yet. Definitley worth the price!"
1	 and would reccomend this game to all who love survival and looting."
1	 devs spoke of this.  Netcode.  This is the biggest one that I imagine will be the most difficult to solve.  Once this is fixed it will make the current PVP actually interesting."
-1	 if you purchase this game be prepared to run around in forests with nothing while getting attacked by zombies and other robots. Strongly would NOT recommend. EXTREMELY BORING."
1	 and very few games can say this.for this alone i reccomend the game.BUT ALSO-20$ is pretty fair price- game runs reasonably well for EA on i5/gtx970/8gb ram (average 30+fps with graphics set on highest settings)-Game seems to have many mechanics to discover and tweak out on-looks pretty dope"
1	 or tasks to complete to help get started."
1	 way more stuff to do and more hardcore. Has been out for 2 days and it runs better than DayZ. I love the game"
1	 then its a no brainer!"
1	games is gold for an ea game it is better than i was expecting an the devs are rolling out patches an crushing bugz as they go
-1	 but at this time there is literaly nothing to do but loot the same stuff and pvp... and the only thing about that is people with crap connection stutter so it makes close combat ridiculous ... maybe it will get better soon"
1	 this should be THE BEST SURVIVAL GAME to ever be released."
-1	"Annoying walking simulator. it's just running from town to town just to find that the whole thing has been looted. All while being constantly annoyed by the ""dynamic"" metabolic system."
1	A great potential usually implies a great potential for this or that.
1	 its alredy better than most survival games and it can get better!"
1	 i dont get why people are expecting more and giving it bad reviews."
-1	 other than to wait."
1	 it's been out for less than 12 hours and people are complaining. Send help"
1	 maybe I already did!-The movement feels amazing-Inventory feels nicely aranged and fairly easy to learn-Crafting makes sense with the required skills.-Shooting feels alright after getting used to it!-Melee feels quite goodConclusion: this game just came out today so there are gonna be many fixes and updates.... at the current state I think this game is about a 6-10. (Just the server fix would make it a 7 xD )"
1	Very fun game. The metabolism system is much simpler than it appears. Definitely reccomend for fans of survival games.
1	 I recommend you to join Discord community which can help you a lot at the beginning of your Scum journey."
1	Hardcore but so much fun good game for any survival collection.
-1	why i don't see any server game??. just single player?
1	 i give this a 10 out of 10. Hopefully they keep improving and make this the best survival game."
-1	 who actually asked for this game?"
-1	nope I couldnt recommend this game yet."
-1	 switch to the other and spray the 2nd 30 rounds into him again... Just runs right up to me punches me once insta killing me... There are hackers every in this game... If you die its probaly due to a hacker... What a waste of money."
1	 so be advised if you don't want to autistically micromanage how many carbs your character is taking in."
1	 it's better than DayZ"
1	 and surving are what I look forward to in the game. Hopefully in a few updates the pvp will be fixed."
-1	 I will spend much more time playing this game and I look forward to the future that the devs might bring to it BUT I believe that the game will be worth playing in a few months and not just now.I look forward to changing my review in a few months!"
-1	I just wish i had only played 2 hours..........
1	 but I can still run the game with low to mid settings and I can't complain. I'm actually amazed my laptop could run this game even if it's still on early access. :DI hope the game developers deliver a great final product and still add features for this game. I also hope I could still run the game when 1.0 comes. :)"
1	good game for that price.
-1	 refund request sent out."
1	 and Croteam have my utmost respect and confidence."
1	 but it seems it could be so much better with a squad or a duo. I am going to recommend this game since the low price is worth a buy even at this early stage. 7/10"
-1	Optimize for the love of God. Even with FPS fixes and custom launch paramaters the game plays terribly. Not worth money at this point.
1	 you can also kill your enemies and make them munch on your scat.Overall 5/5 very optimistic about the game's direction."
1	It's better than dayz thats for sure.
1	 very fun. Devs actively update the game and are active in the Reddit community /rSCUMgame. Steam community sucks assss"
1	 gameplay is awesome!"
1	 the devs do care and lsiten they updated the came with a patch in less then 6 hours when they heared about the connection errors . Can't wait for further updates"
1	 shelter options. Great work devs and very responsive to community!"
1	 occasional drops when entering towns but leveled off again."
1	 what other game lets you take a dump on a mattress?"
-1	This game so far is very good but there is one thing that makes me not recomend it. and that's the state the PVP is in right now. You can get in a fist fight with somebody and he is teleporting around and you have to bassicaly guess where he is going to be. Fix this then the game will be worth 20$
1	11/10 <3
1	 just watch out.  8/10"
1	dont even buy it.for those who like survival game this is a very good investment.visualy its awesome w/o lags.devs are active fixing issues as fast as they can."
1	Best EA game that has came out in a long time.
-1	Waste.
1	 but now I feel 17EU is quite cheap for the experience you get in this game."
-1	This would have been better if it came out when DayZ was popular.  Now it just feels outdated and it is new.
-1	There is a typo in game name
1	Fun game and well done for a Day 1 EA game.  IMO it is already 10x better than DayZ was and this is just Day 1.  Looking forward to seeing the improvements.
1	Best survival game 2018.... best game 2018... just the best game... ever. cant describe better than thatjoin the server! 172.107.16.231:28102
1	 and the flying guard robots are annoying in good side :) 9.7/10 survival game"
1	Great game for 20$ and it's only going to improve.
1	 and with a brighter future ! LOVE IT"
-1	 with a little physics thrown in there."
-1	entirely unplayable in its current state. i'll reinstall and try again in 3 months.
-1	 took me an hour of looting an entire town just to find a stick of butter and a lighter. If they fixed the performance and actually added stuff to do besides kill other players it would be fine"
1	SCUM is an early access survival game that I've been following since december of 2017. It got delayed about 100000 times so when it came out my hype was at about 8/10 I'm still hype for the game and I think that the second they get base building and vehicles into the game It'll be greatFinal vertic: 6/10 can't find anyone to murder also the proximity voice chat is wionky af no matter where you are when people talks it sounds like they're in your ear
1	 which is to be expected. But I am confident this will be a fantastic game in due time.Best of Luck Devs!"
1	 which will be exciting to witness and enjoy.Get in early now and git gud."
-1	And how do you request a refund again?
1	Running Simulator 2.0 Stamina Edition
1	 like any early access game.... get it while it's only 19.99!!!!"
1	had almost 80 hours in one and a half week... a bit boring if you can't figure out what to do but just suicide and start from scratch again... that's what i do for now and i'm not getting tired of it!
-1	dumbest game ever stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Early Access game.. Still has time to improve
1	 but with this price I won't refund it as I like to see this kind of progress in the video game industry and would back it up with this price anyway."
1	Great game!!!
1	 10/10 worth every penny. Support the Devs . YA HEARD."
1	 simply because it isnt finished yet. Check if it's actually a quality review.. most negative ones are not."
1	 be patience is a EARLY ACCESS."
1	Great game
1	whats dayz?
1	 and the game runs smooth in my limitations. Really good optimization for all gamers. Would recommend."
1	Good Game some server problems but its no problem for me because its early acess and can be fixed in the futur ;)
-1	a very confusing game :)
-1	 time will tell if the execution is there but overall pretty fun and nerve wracking at times.Plus you can poop and pee."
-1	It's like DayZ but you can poop.
-1	Full of hackers
-1	 but these people will ruin your night of gaming. And it's going to be the onsies and twosies that keep popping up with hacks. Don't buy this game. It's a waste of money until they submit a devblog stating that they're actively banning people for hacking and solving the issue."
-1	 right."
1	I bought a server i would like to know how can i pull up the admin options
-1	 not fun in current state"
1	 and this is a way to kill ur free time !"
1	 is to get rid of those AIMBOTTING robots. Replace them with a strong zombie or maybe a horde of zombies guarding the bunkers/military areas. Plus zombies/robots don't go together"
1	From the very little time I have played its been the most fun ive had in a game in a long time. Very intense and im always on the edge on my seat in towns/military outpost.
1	 so those will most likely be fixed. But this game delivers everything Dayz failed at delivering. 8/10"
-1	Hackers everyehere. Could not even get a single piece of loot in the little bit of time I played. Just kept getting killed after walking around a bit by thin air. Got a refund RIP SCUM
-1	 but I also bet it is Steams most refunded game as well."
-1	 like some sort of map glitch! very frustrating and needs to be fixed"
1	 we make away with our hard earned loot! Very exciting!"
1	good game but for sum reason it says i got ban for something i didnt even do. i went to get back on today. it says im band
-1	The PVP aspect of the game is completely broken... Have to try shooting a jumper goodluck. The teleporting when seeing another player is pretty cancer unplayable unless you have a shotgun
-1	I walked for 2 hours and got killed for a hacker...
1	 afew bugs here and their but overall HUGE potential and devs to back it up."
1	I didn't have such an amazing and atmospheric experience in 4 years of DayZ and this game gave it to me in 10 hours of playing. Hella worth the buy in my opinion.
1	 but I can confidentally say it is worth the 20$!"
1	Great game. Very hardcore survival game. people that are hating are ignorant of the survival aspect. Bugs and desync but thats expected from an early access game.
1	some potential but not really very fun at this point. also couldnt find any zombies?
1	 a few crashes but hope they get fixed"
-1	ima keep it real with you chief this game unfinished af lmao
1	Great game.
-1	 atleast then you might get a few hours out of it."
1	 some fps issues on a lower end rig but thats to be expected."
-1	 Easy loot and not a challenge at all. Believe the developer paid youtubers to promote his game."
1	 an actual -survival- game!"
-1	its bad
1	GREAT well rounded hardcore survival game. Looks great and runs fairly well considering it has only been out a few days. The devs seem dedicated also bc there have already been updates. For $20 you seriously cant go wrong!!!
1	10/10 Would explosive diarrhea again.
-1	 won't come back to the game in a year or few months to see if it's improved."
1	10x better than dayZ and it has only been out a day.
-1	 players warping all over the pace and horrible frames on a decent system."
1	this game is great everyone on here that gives it a bad review has like 1 hour and got killed by a hacker but if you play with a 5 man group of friends the game is still fun we all got killed by a man named fco.jgza in game and we logged out went to a new server and waited for him to get off then went to airfield and then foundry and got all the loot back in an hour it just depends what server your on the game is great it looks good its fun and realistic just in EA and can use some updates to it like bows or base building other than that i love this game 100%
1	 people need to look at what there getting which is a lot for a VERY EARLY ACSESS GAME. Servers issues can be fixed and they are being fixed.  If you have the money and are looking for a survival game I really do suggest SCUM."
1	Its been 5 of releace days and its better and have more things to do than a 6 year old game called dayz <3
-1	 it said 15 hours played. LOL"
-1	 at least before they add servers without fame system."
1	Def a work in progress. a decent survivor game if you like that. though it seems gotta find the right server so its not completely empty which a huge map where you cant find anyone.
1	BEST EARLY ACCESS I HAVE TRIED!!. The game looks fantasic and even that its just a sandbox at the moment there is alot to do and see. Looking forward to see this as it goes.
1	Igra je zakon
1	 very good."
-1	Terrible Game H1Z1 Knock off no objective you will never find your friends before you starve to death or get killed by a hacker.
1	 get some meds/food/water/gun/ammo... I'm not sure why people are complaining to be honest. Game runs exceptionally well with hardly a stutter. Fantasticly game with fluid vaulting and great inventory/looting!Please keep it up"
1	This game is a better more optimized version of DayZ 10/10Awesome survival mechanics hit detections pretty good.Best feature is the ability to poop/urinate on your dead enemies corpse right before you eat his flesh 10/10
1	 although it has lots of bugs and missing features at this time. I trust the developers to hammer out the fixes and get the game out of Early access ASAP."
-1	 fails to deliver. Atleast for me.My Specs:I7 4790kgeforce 980gtx16 gigs of ramand im NOT running it from an SSDThe result are 60-80 fps on default settings with hickups and stuttering as things get rendered in. To get 120+ i had to tone it down to 720p and turn almost everything off/low. That smoothed it out but it didnt help the fact that aiming down sights still felt terrible. The low FOV didnt help that feeling either and ofc the game looked like i forgot my glasses. Trying to identify items on the ground = mission impossible.My Recommendations to the developers:Intigrate a ""hold"" option for aiming down sights. (i would personally also like to see a transition rather then instant pop in.)Intigrate a FOV sliders for ADS and Firstperson in general.Optimize performance LIKE CRAZY.Especially the last part here doesnt sounds particularly flashy on a update news page. But who cares about 3 new backpacks when playing feels aweful.As it stands the game is just unenjoyble for me. The ADS (aim down sights) and Framerate beeing the MAIN reason why.So if you have a beastly computer that can handle it. And you don't mind toggle aim down sights with low FOV. Give it a shot. Otherwise i cannot recommend the game in it's current state."
1	 I rate 10/10."
1	looks like a good game that could have alot of potential :)
1	 thumbs up for support so far!"
1	It's early doors but this game has been good fun tonight. Found some weapons and got attacked by a mech. A passing player donated a pitch fork to my cause. It's Animal Crossing meets Titanfall. Everyone's lovely and f**king ROBOTS!
1	 it was time for the 1st poo... :oIt was a majestic hard as a log dump! Amazingly it dropped 1 MP5 magazine!!! :DWhat have i been eating?! :o"
-1	 it's cropped."
1	 zombie apoc. game. Would recommend."
-1	 makes it 50FOV which makes people sick"
-1	The innovative features look cool but contribute very little to the game. After a very short time you will run out of things to do. It got boring real quick but hopefully the devs keep working on it. Also the robots suck and should be replaced with something more fitting to the game.
-1	 bugs and issues that in my opinion ruin the game for now"
-1	 sitting around a box of loot while cooking meat on a campfire."
1	 but i'm sure it'll get there"
1	It could be better. I think it will get better. Devs are putting in the time and effort to make responsive and positive changes to make the game better. But right now... if I was sitting on the sidelines. I'd wait.
1	 it's already on par with or better than the originators who are still ""alpha"". (Slam)   This is the game we have been waiting for!"
1	 this one is hard to beat.  As of this review I have 12 hours of SCUM gameplay and I have enjoyed every minute.  If you are a fan of hardcore open world survival games this is worth a try for only $20.  When playing an alpha game you have to look past the bugs and issues and decide if the core game is something worth sticking around for and of all the alpha games I have purchased (A LOT) this one is at the top of my list of worth it.   I look forward to what scum will become in the future.For an Alpha game i give this a 7.5/10."
1	Right now its a very vanilla dayz clone with better graphics sound is very misleading needs work crafting system also fubar nice graphics zombies take a good beating and react to it nicelyand for your fecal matter enthusiast you can take a dump <--------- 7/10 realism you dont use tp you use your hand and never seem to clean it!!!
1	 but definitely best one out of the battle royal games"
-1	 taken out the back and shot. Absolutely ruins what could otherwise be a great game. That and the potato servers people are FORCED to use for now. If you are going to force one server host on everyone at least choose a host that can actually deliver."
1	This game is what DayZ should have been already.
1	 It will help you learn stuff!! GREAT GAME so far.."
1	 yes the PvP isn't great right now.. but it's coming along.  Graphics are very quality and the survival is so in-depth it'll take a while to learn.I'd recommend this game right now at $20.  It'll be fun to see how it develops over the next year or two."
1	 especially for such early access.  Dev's are very quick to fix issues as well as update and release new content.  Can't ask for more from an early access survival game!"
-1	Has potential. Would not recommend right now.
1	 it's worth checking out."
1	 Survivors."
-1	 check back in a year."
-1	 gameplay unclear."
-1	I spent 1 hour in the dark and found nothing. I then spent the next hour with no food or water. I then after 1 hour 45 min found a guy with full gear and an AK and he killed me on the spot. This game isn't fun. Its way too slow. Not easy to find friends or add freinds. I can't imagine this getting even one good review.
1	 and no lagging. These devs are amazing!"
1	 Hello SCUM."
1	Nice game
1	 his mom's socks and a wooden spear stabs me in the face and takes all my loot. #walkingSim2018 #DayZstarvationMod..... 10/10 would waste 5 hours of my Fu**ing life walking accross a map just to get lag killed again."
-1	The last 4 hours are the most boring and wasted hours of my life. PRO's:You can walk.CON's:There would have to be some kind of game in order to list cons. There isn't because there is simply no gameplay. There is quite litterally NOTHING to do in this game. NOTHING. You are better off eating paste.
1	Skinnned a dear and it turned into a donkey. 10/10
-1	Crap game
-1	optimization problems and stamina makes the game quite bad.I know this game is an early access game so maybe I'll change this review after new updates."
-1	Just play Rust. this game not good
1	 the devs dont like that bad trait. Nor the mechs."
1	Amazing survival game as itr is right now. I can't wait to see what the futuere holds for this game.
-1	so many bugs
1	Decent for a game Pre Alpha/Alpha."
1	I care more about my SCUM character than I care about myself.
1	 this game is extremely promising."
1	 aun esta muy verde pero ahi la lleva 8/10 Puedes Cagar Sobre tus enemigos!! Literalmente!!!"
1	I dont know why this game has mixed reviews its alpha and for alpha its pretty bloody good! not much to do besides loot military bases and get geared up but even just surviving is fun and just looking around. worth the $20 because this game is going to dominate dayz and the likes of.
-1	 on a somewhat consistent basis. And i'm not seeing that here."
1	 wrong time. Guess I really am SCUM.7/10 - Already a fun time waster and definitely has the potential to keep growing and getting better."
-1	 unless you're wanting to support the developers. I'll try it again later when it's had more work done"
1	 and it's only gonna get better from here so I'm stoked.Update: 37 hours in.. They have come out with two updates. The first one fixed the 21:9 issue so now I can play on 2560x1080 proper.. Second update has greatly helped the server desync lag issue. Love that the devs are updating so quickly. The game is amazing. Hands down my favorite game already.."
-1	 but then again i spend 8 hours at a time playing while he comes on for an hour or two each day"
1	 for me."
-1	The game is crushing after a while. I've refound it.
-1	Dosent even work just lags and bugs 5 seconds into the game it crashes
-1	 survival game. Right when you start to like the game you hit an end to the content. There is barely enough items to get about 2 hours out of the game. Which is unfortunate because I would have returned it then. Now it has to sit in the pile of games that are unfinished and unplayable. With the rate at which all these games develope I will have a playable game within the next 5-10 years. But hey! if you like to tirelessly read updates logs just waiting for the perfect moment it's worth playing again this game is for you. If not I couldn't recommend it."
1	Much Love <3Some much potential and its already running good with amazing graphics!
1	It's like if Miscreated and PUBG had a baby and their baby made out with The Forest and created SCUM.  Very well polished for an EA game. It has working features that other games have tried in years of development to implement them and never managed to. Love every asspect of the game !
1	Peed on my mates head and took a dump in his shelter. 10/10 game.
1	Game has extreme potential.
1	BEST GAME EVERRR
-1	bad frame rates no servers for sea region
-1	Can't actually play the game properly cause the server list is broke.  Will update when fixed.
-1	no 21:9 support. refunded. no thanks
-1	 and good luck finding anything anywhere."
1	 and when is too much. The Zombies are fast as hell though and avoiding them can be a task and risk but getting past that is cool as well. For survival game I would recommend this game to anyone in to this genre of games."
1	 the shooting is pretty good too not the best but good."
1	 beacause when the game get more updates and more content i see (maybe not) the price getting bigger."
1	good :)))
-1	 - DayZ isn't this bad."
-1	I would wait a bit before buying this unless you are a hardcore gamer into the survival genre and you want to support the development of the game. They released it far too early. Too many bugs. Including desync in multiplayer that makes combat rarely go well. You need to play such a big map with 64 players but when you try to you can't hit anybody as they keep teleporting due to desync. As the game is still bare bones there isn't enough to do to make up for it. This game has great promise but I think releasing it now was a mistake. Basic is ok but not basic and broken. Even when they get around to sorting out the issue people are going to be a bit over it.
1	Can pee on your friends. 10/10
-1	 for pointless loot and terrible crafting with the hope that yuo may encounter 1 zombie or player that often takes about 3 hours of house to house to see ...then you will love this game.your spend most of time looking for food this game is an arcade house searching simulator ....I would strongly look at the profiles of these great reviews as your find many of them streamers and people was given a key to review and many of them completely bias ..you can even tell from the review it self with such reviews as 9/10 great game ...."
-1	 I avoided every single blow. But I bet the same was happening to his screen. Because no life was going down. Thing goes like that and gets more and more frustrating."
1	 and the game plays like a polished version of other survival games. It is a very fun game to play with friends"
-1	 very disappointed. So many thing but they are useless."
1	 then you will enjoy this."
1	Tons of fun with friends but mechs kinda buggy
-1	 then are running or jumping a metre off the ground to attack? Might as well take up golf with angry handicappers than walk around here."
-1	garbage
-1	Scum looks very impressive sounds pretty good not sure how the game play is due to bad connection but what i did experience was o.k zombies sound weird thought wild boar was near(FOOD) but got consumed by zombies....they are impossible to take out if your loaded and ready to rumbull are there any guns in the game seems they don't i haven't found one!!! pitch fork and baseball bat is the best i could find in the 50 or so buildings i searched the floor plan of the building's got abit boaring more food could've helped or even animals to eat got to the big concrete wall just to be told i was going to die if i went any further thougt that was bit cheap more zombies or robocop bots guarding that boundary or mounting big guns to wall would  be better. $20 great starting price looking forward to seeing if it gets better or boring.
1	 but dont forget it is still early acess and developers are working with their comunity if it is twitter reddit or other medium... now .... back to game ... bye :D"
-1	 want my 20 bucks back . Last time I buy early access rubbish"
1	This game is nothing but brilliant. It's still growing with updates as well which is amazing. I think they plan to bring base building and vehicles to the game soon which will be nothing but an improvement. the game is a polished DayZ and Mistreated. The only thing that really needs fixing is the Dsync which i believe will be fixed soon enough. I can't wait to make a RolePlay server on this. Discord to my server that is currently in the making is https://discord.gg/M7AmXCM  The release date is yet to be confirmed but will be soon.
1	 it just cannot be explained any simpler."
1	Took a poop good game
1	Graphic is fine. But soo hard to find bullet.
-1	i wanted to refund  because of the bad optimization and lack of south american servers.but the game keept on runing in the background or something and now its says i played for 4 hours and i only played for half an hour. Shady tactic i guess the name of the game fits the developers
1	 most players have a mic and the interaction with the enviroment and the world and character go to major exstents and realism. <3"
1	good but fix lag of servers
-1	 but i went through 5 different bases and the big robots aren't exactly difficult to avoid."
1	I actually quite enjoy this game I like the content that's in the game now and I'm really happy with what the road map for Content thats coming
1	.
1	 definitely interested in seeing how the devs keep up with the game's popularity."
1	 looks like more crafting options will be added plus vehilces at some point as during character ceration it does show greyed out driving skills."
-1	 I just can't give it a thumbs up right now."
1	Some techincal issues and stuff like that. but a sweet game overall. It is EARLY ACCESS afterall.
1	 however I'm only seeing potential of what could be. pls keep it up k"
-1	 thanks"
1	This game has been a lot of fun already looking forward to playing many more hours. The devs have been great about pushing update and fixes that are common with an EA game.
1	 yesterday I made a fire ring beside my camp and this morning it is not there anymore. I though that the fire ring was a fire that I would just have to ignite beside my camp not to rebuild everytime. Why search for rocks to make a fire ring if the improvised fire have the same effect."
-1	i couldn't install english language in my region  and i refunded game. Bc I don't want lose my time in search solution technical problems in web.
-1	 not the best."
-1	Just a DayZ rip off with added features
1	Its like reliving DayZ mod. Except this one gets updated more frequently and has a future planned out.
1	Add more cities or make the current ones bigger with more tall buildings. And for God sake fix the aiming system in this game. But overall the game is great.
-1	It was slow and boring.Not all all what its hyped to be.
-1	 it was released like 4 days ago..."
-1	 thanks"
1	Great game. Smooth launch. There are buggs but they will be ironed out.
-1	 avoid like the plague unless you enjoy someone with 500 ping teleporting behind you without speaking your language"
1	RIP DAYZ!!! Even in its infancy this game is more than dayz has ever had or offered....and I love it!! If you think this review is crap go look at my hours in dayz standalone and arma 2 combined operations (mod days). This is everything epoch mod was and more I cant wait to see this games development as I'm already happy. 30$ (Canadian lol) well spent!
1	- Sodium over 3000%- Still Alive- Got killed by a goat while pooping10/10 would poop again
1	SCUM = P E R F E C T
-1	The game is poor
-1	 this game is simply not fun."
1	 closest thing to what dayz was before devs ruined it :)"
1	It's pretty good
1	 And team deathmatches you can jump into.   You dont lose your gear when you jump into any of the special game modes.  Devs are fixing problems imediatley after they are reported.  Best early access experience i have ever had.  I am recomending this game to all of my friends."
1	Its good.
1	 this gem will be a genre king."
-1	If you consider playing this game with a 1050 ti good luck
-1	 zombies glitch through small airport hangar walls.  Needs work hope they can polish this turd."
1	 it's pretty addicting not to mention it's only 20 bucks."
1	still better than DayZ XDDD
1	So far so good. Much more playable than Dayz.
-1	 melee is a joke. It's really just not worth paying for at the moment. I played for about 12-13 hours and I wish I hadn't even wasted my time. All it has left me with is a bitter taste in my mouth."
1	 we just have to wait ultill they fix a lot of things."
1	 bringing updates on sunday for us haha."
1	 looking promising if they continue to patch & update alot of stuff."
1	Like the potensial of this game.  they need get some more Self owned buildable bases ASAP. Staying tuned so owerall so far so good =)
-1	 then i say the game is well worth the money to play it. If you cannot then bypass this game until the dev's get things undercontrol.If you can deal with the wipes: 8/10If you cannot deal with the wipes: 2/10"
1	Awesome.
1	 but it is not the final version of the game.    Give it a chance...you will like it."
-1	 so you have to look left look right  about 20 times to just figure out 1 recipe  at current stage i would not recommend this game.  have got refund from steam as many are having the same  problems with it i did."
1	 who don't get good internet in the field. First or Third Person to suit your desire.Being able to cut up and consume your prey as well as cut their clothing into resources(in game of course) tickles my predator instinct.Devs are very active and willing to recreate if necessary.I've got huge hopes for the outcome of this game and feel like I've already got my moneys worth."
-1	Worst game I've ever played. i'd have more fun circumcising myself with a rusty nail.
1	Game looks nice but you canot play whit GTX750 25 fps ..
1	i like the game. tobad im only going guarded places cuz thats the only good spot. towns need a little more loot tbh
-1	 my first hour of the game is amazing."
-1	terrible optimization. 30fps ...
-1	 but the delivery was poor."
-1	 you're just like the others developers."
1	my dream game with single player peace.. Rip dayz..
1	Nice game!
1	This game is exactly what i thought it would be; a hardcore survival simulation experience. Devs are very active and listens to feedback.If you don't like walking around for 2 hours trying to maintain a sustainable diet without meeting anyone; this is not for you.
1	I met a man named Dirty Mittens and he was shot by a giant mech and i took his stuff. I was then also shot by a giant mech. 10/10 good job devolver.
-1	 Conan). Refund request submitted."
1	It can only get better
1	Its the bestest game in the get good world!!!!!!! MY NAME IS JEBUS AND JESUS IS MY DAD!!!!!!!!
1	best homeless simulator
1	so far so good
1	 it is not in the least comparable to the rest found on the market excluding Rust. 10/10"
1	Great start to the game. It's only going to get better.
1	 keep the updates comming and this game will be great."
1	 refund it."
1	. So here is my story from inside scum. I was strarving hungry and after i was blasted in the arm by another prisoner on the island i had managed to flee into a nearby wooded area and hide while my prisoner was slowly bleeding to death. I took a small knife i had looted from one of the houses earlier and used it to cut my nice baseball cap into some strips and then used them to dress my wounds. After another hike to a small town near some water i was attacked by a zombie and after smacking it several times in the face it layed doen in front of me. I was now in major need of food now and their was only one real source of food. Must say he tasted better than he looked.
1	 this will be an absolutely fantastic game."
-1	 you cant even find half the servers your friends are playing on. WHen you connect through IP it doesn't work. Overall awful game"
1	 but I feel like the foundation of the game is very solid already. Good job so far!"
-1	 so I will. Giving it a thumbs down will show the devs to keep fixing the game. I really hope this game becomes the next big thing."
1	 at least at launch!"
1	 it looks good and is more indepth than other survival games.It's early access. Will change based on release"
-1	 game is gonna be dead in 2 weeks max.Thank god I refunded in time."
1	You can get diarrhea in the game.11/10
1	 heehee."
-1	 But its trash with the buff of robots its rage inducing and has ruined the game. Avoid for now"
1	What Dayz wishes it was
1	Awsome refresh on a survial game the devs seam to really care about the game and try to fix bugs very quick in my opinon the devs are really doing great work to make sure this game does not die out of the gate. Plus you can poop on people you kill so it is worth the 20 buck and then some
-1	 but this is not it in my opinion."
1	 if you can get past dying when you are fully geard."
-1	 so i'd advice waiting."
1	decent
1	is there a reason my game play lagging ???
-1	 making them invisible. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to have a good and fair pvp fight. I will likely change my review when they fix these issues. I do understand its only in EA but the game should still be kinda playable like most other EA games. I wish good luck to the developers and hope that the game turns into what it has the potential to become."
-1	 it might be worth it. maybe. (most likely not...)"
-1	massive hype build up for nothing...rubbish
-1	TOTAL TRASH WHY RELEASE A GAME THIS EARLY. ITS TERRIBLE
1	 and is all around fun!"
1	The Sims : Hardcore Edition
1	so far the best survival game in early access
1	 so theres that."
1	 but still easy to understand and pick up on. The events are a great way to combat the boredom that you usually have with running simulators. I can't wait to see where this goes."
1	 not my type of game."
-1	Beware hackers are everywhere. Huge amounts of d-sync. no anti cheat in such game is the reason you shouldnt buy this game + the D-sync is killing the fun part so at this state i do not recommend buying this game
-1	 not freeze) you can't even get a refund from Steam. It's a total scam."
1	 etc. Bow and arrow would be awesome as a first step"
-1	DayZ with an actual digestive system.
1	 which I'm sure they will; they seem pretty determined with this!Give it a shot maybe ya'll! Cheers!"
-1	 if you dont enjoy survival games where you run around the map for the entirity of the gameplay with very little pvp i would not reccomend this game. I have refunded the game as i didnt enjoy my 2 hours of playing it."
1	 glock come on hook us up. A prison Game mode would be dope too i saw the jail part od the map. THIS GAME IS HOT!!!"
1	Aldente
-1	 the crafting is more work to figure out then surviving.  Not enough loot.  I realize it is early access and these things  could change in the future but for now I dont recommend it.  Give it time."
1	 and the gun play is something you'd have to try for yourself to see how smooth it feels! Good luck and see you around the prison!                                                                                    9.5/10 ~G"
1	i like that the map is big but getting from one place to another across the map is kind of dificult so i would apritiate u adding vehicles and new guns are also important
1	Has alot of potential.  Needs more content.  Very polished for a $19.99 game.  Looking forward to the future of the game.
-1	how can i get this game to quite lagging so bad
-1	trash
1	 so with that and the consistent updates I'm reasonably confident the game will only get better and be well worth the money."

1	very  good  game been  enjoying  it  only  complaint  is  the  lag   and  some  minor frame  rate  issues  during  gameplay  hope  that can  be  fixed  in  the future  would  highly  recommend it  for  anyone   to  give it  a try .Happy  gaming  to  all.
1	You can $#!% in the woods with your friends 10/10.
-1	 played 2 hours WE got bored!!!!!I know its early acces BUT STILL make it so that you can get your loot back after you die.....Got 444 points and when got back in action its 0 nowNo place to buld a camp or hide or starage box??!!!(base building )Sad to see me opening my chrismass present and its a used barbie doll...............WIll still give the game a try It was my chrismass pesent .................... Good luck Game Developers"
1	 but it's Early Access for a reason and I look forward to keeping pace with the developers as their vision is realized."
1	 my god. This game looks like a masterpiece."
1	 support the developer.It's totally worth it."
1	 and gear is insane.I can't wait to see what the final product of SCUM will evolve into.Get it while it's $20."
1	 Bases. Amazing stuffGive this game some time and its going to be amazing."
1	 as I in turn dismember other prisoners just to see what makes their legs move. Yeah. Such a snow flake."
1	First its an early access game.second that cost close to 17 euros.and third the devs doing work and listening to the community now compare it with dayz and leave a positive review!Thank you
-1	Like the dayz mod from 6 years ago with way less features. Followed this games development for over a year but this is a terrible first impression.
1	 but awesome survival especially the pve"
1	 the game is already in one of the best Early Access states compared with other games."
1	 ofc there are a few lags sometimes in busy areas but I definitly recommand this awesome game! Awesome dev team too !"
1	 running towards him to unleash my karate chop to finish him off-Seen his other skinny rat looking friend appear running down the hill -He has a shovel.-I turn around and run away-Found underground bunker-Get killed my Mech-Respawned-Took a poop and found a Banana10/10"
-1	 everything is in the way of you enjoying the cool parts"
1	 it goes to a random monitor. Not cool. I wish I could play it more :("
1	 just run to a military base and get geared upKOS KOS KOS (every player doesn't know what the talk button is and just shots on site)Airfield is the only PVP place due to 64 player serversBarely any content at the moment (will come)Third Person combat is useless as the peaking mechanic is broken AFOverrall the game ATM is fun for a few hours then get's extremely boring."
1	 I feel this game will loose momentum if they can't add the storyline or the events sooner then later"
1	just a good game
1	It actually better than I predicted. Crazy because even with the issues it has its more addicting than any other game I have played since ARK. Cant wait to see whats next. Just keep the community updates frequent and I will be happy throughout development. Defiantly worth 20$
-1	ranning simulatrpr
1	 but server hosting need some fixes."
1	Buyer beware.  Do your research....  but I've had some really fun moments in this game...  time will tell but this is the best chance for a updated Dayz experience.  It's already WAYYYY  better than SA.I hope they pull it off.
1	Fun game and especially for a early acces has a lot of potential
-1	 this is a perfect game.10/10- ign"
1	 i was off on my adventure."
1	 very detailed"
1	amazing game for being in aplha keep it up guys
1	finally a decent early access survival game that's not ShitZ
-1	It takes more the maximum 2 hours for refund to realize that the game is bad. Steam wont refund you so.
-1	 leave this game immediately."
1	The game is very enjoyable and full of very detailed character statistics.
1	much real such good
1	 which brings a whole new dynamic to survival games.Will you use cunning and stealth to hide from Mech Sentries to get to high loot places?Or will you wait with nice gear and a SVD outside to kill the ones who just done that work for ya?EXCELLENT GAME!9/10edit: Typo"
1	 and join the SCUM brotherhood!"
1	 I think the FOV is zoomed in too much. I think this might  be to help with the FPS at the moment and im hopeful they will add an FOV slider in the future as they optimise the game.  Anyway  i just wanted to give this game the credit it deserves     10 / 10"
1	 also pvp is almost impossible with the amount of glitching the players do. Still recommend and has a lot of potential."
1	 but I expected as much since this is the second day of alpha and servers are flooded because of hype. Honestly at $20 you can't beat it."
-1	 then you probably wont find much use for this game. Refunding and waiting to see where this game goes."
1	Everything I wanted DayZ and H1Z1 to be.
1	This game has serious potential. Really enjoy playing it. Just quite a few bugs still which is expected with early access.Really recommend this to anyone. Far better than PUBG as well as GTA Online
1	 have 22 hours of fun out of it so far highly recomend. its had a good lauch i just hope the devs keep working on it to bring new content to make the game even more exiting. but before added such features the game as a whole needs optimisation but THIS GAME IS AMAZING."
1	the game is good but it needs aloy of work due to the fact that your in a sever and within a cou0ple of mins you are kicked out and have to start over again with a new player adn have to find all the loot again
-1	 lets see where this goes."
1	I like
1	Seven Steps to do any task... 10/10
1	So far im enjoying it. All though I don't have many hours it's sure to change. What i'm hoping for soon is more populated AUS server for me and my friends and a solution to their being no loot what so ever besides at military outposts. I do have very little game time so I could've just been unlucky. But so far the game has been superb. The details and the feel of it is amazing to me.
-1	 Memory leaks (went from 100+ fps to 40-50 in 20mins) I was really looking forward to this game but it's a huge dissapointment its just dayz with a few extra features tbh dayz is better. REFUNDED"
1	 will 100% come back later and pay a higher price once they are ironed out."
-1	It didn't even let me join a server.
-1	 there's no loot and tons of glitch 10/10 would refund again"
1	fun gaem
-1	DONT BUY !!! cheaters are every where this game is full of cheater !!!!!!!!!!
1	Quite literally the best way to make 20 of your hard earned dollars disapear for little to no value. Highly recomend.
1	The best open world/survival our there right now. Even thou its still in pre-release.
1	 i think this will be the best survival game out there :) ."

-1	BRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFT *plop* SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
1	Epic game :))
1	VERY GUT
-1	 etc.   im sure it will be much better in a year or so"
1	:D
-1	The controls are weird and the UI is confusing as hell if that gets fixed then it might be a cool game! sorry :|
1	 but almost 20fps i am getting just optimize asap and try to fix desync issues."
1	 shooting through walls and doors.Overall i think this game has decent potential if the devs keep working at it."
-1	 once you get guns with full mags and extra ammo there is really no reason to play since pvp is so rare. Well optimized and decent game but just doesn't hold attention."
-1	 only to come across a zombie and really not being able to defend yourself very well thus you end up being killed and having to restart the whole thing over again from scratch in a differant part of the map."
1	 ran to the woodline to take a poop in private.... pooped out an AK mag :)"
1	I think this game is a great game for its early access phase and for 20 bucks. The graphics look really outstanding and their is alot to do. I like as you do things you build up fan and if you do die you have options to spawn in a ranndom location to even a squad mate. I love the concept of an accualy realistic suvival game. The devs also are coming out with updates very often which is very encouraging and are intouch with there community. Im still gicing this a thumbs up and a definite 5 star but my only thing right now with the understand its early access and they are working on it. I feel like becasue the map is so vast that there is ALOT of running. Becasue of the stamana it can take a long time to get from grid to grid. But with that said there are alot of elements in the game to still make it alot of fun!
1	 will update if the enjoyment persists over a longer period of time. I have high hopes !"
1	Very good game!
1	Best survival game I have played so far through H 1Z1 and Miscreated and DayZ this one is the best (haven't played Arma yet)
1	 dont try running this game on a Potato"
-1	 and I don't want to delve deep into the survival game cycle that I have previously fallen into before.0/10 - Best game i've ever played."
1	 they are salty that they cant defeat a mech with a wooden spear."
-1	Not Liking It. Everyone Will Hate At Me That I Havent Played The Game Enough But Its Just Not My Game. Its Just Not My Type Of Game.
1	yeah its pretty good
-1	this is one of the worst games i have ever played in a while ...... i spent 2 hours looting for clothing and guns without ammo to then die from 1 zombie because i couldnt fight back i wish i can get a refund for this game
1	I killed a bear and made a bear costume.10/10
1	SSSCCCUUUUUUMMMMMGGGGGAAAAANNNNGGGGGGGG
1	 but to be honest I don't wanna spend 80 years meeting up with buddies to just die. Pros- Grahpically good- FUN- Not too grindy- Easy to learn but difficult to master- devs appear to care - The priceCons- could use optimisation- Desync in it's current state can be kinda bad- Could use more weapons and things (that will come in the future i'm sure)"
1	 keep the good work up and give us updates on a 14 days basis and you will have a successful game!"
1	 probably one of the best i've seen in this genre.. introduce crafting structures and it would be.."
1	 but you get used to it after couple of hours playing"
-1	Standalone but with heavier breathing. Dont bother
1	 the game has potential. After a while when they start polishing up it will be good. Let's hope that wont take 2 years."
1	Got killed by a goat then a boar after reviving- IGN 10/10
1	It's early acces but so far it's highly polished for how far in development it is. It's not PUBG. It's not DayZ. I'm not even sure what the goal is yet but so far the gameplay is much more fun than many other survival or battle Royal games that I've played.
-1	The best way to describe this game would be PUBG after 2 years of drug abuse. Horrible FPS (my computer is not bad) on low settings and 0 loot. I have so little hours due to the fact that moving is quite literally not a possibility because of frame drop.
1	 if thats sounds cool to you don't heistate. Last I just want to is the ball is now in the middle of the court I look forward to reviewing it again in a monthly basis!"
-1	Don't buy this game yet if you expect a fair fight in PVP. The Pvp is broken. Players are invisible to you half the time. In theroy this is a good game but its for PvE atm. The Pve survival is good. Everyone leaving positive reviews are not metioning one bad thing about the game while it obviously has a long way to go. I have mentioned both good and bad.
1	 I really recommend you check this game out.The game has great potential and can't wait to see what's coming next!"
1	 this game is EARLY ACCESS!"
1	SCUM
1	 I recommend this game."
-1	 seriously."
1	 I have a good feeling about it.-Goltrix2580"
1	Haven't had this much fun playing a game since early Arma 2 DayZ mod.  This game is worth way more than $20.
-1	 you are not doing for free you just get paid from the people."
1	already hooked.will be the best.
-1	Scam*
-1	 has caused me to lose 3 pistols so far.    Missing features. its an Early Access game so i cant complain too much here but there are a lot of useless things in the game right now that have features your unable to use as they have not been implemented yetit seems there are a few people not experiencing these issues with fps and bugs with different setups or are happy playing with lower fps than usual but i cannot speak for those people. i think there is a degree of luck with it at the moment. While i love the concept of the game and cant wait to see its future there is too much wrong with it right now. i will happily change this review in the future when the game is in a truly playable state. as a customer buying the supporter pack i hope it comes sooner rather than later."
1	 other players are in the game just to add a more realistic feel to the survival and give it another it factor i only run into a few players per session unless you go to airfield.  game is very in depth and has a learning curve but fun to learn also the roadmap and things that will be implemented seem like it will be a very full game"
-1	Servers suck
-1	"I will save everyone the hassel and the money. This is what you get for $22.75""Failed to join Server""your welcome!"
1	Great Game cant wait to see what it turns into.
1	 keep up the good work!"
-1	How did I buy this mess
1	SCUm is definitely in the works. I can't get over 40fps and the graphics are not optimized. Fun to play with friends.
-1	 hold off for a bit"
1	 and I for one care to give them what little support I can for being so passionate about what they do."
1	 fortification etc.) and movement is really bad. The map is big and the entire game has a sort of a backstory.Would strongly recommend buying SCUM if you like DayZ and Rust but in hardcore mode."
1	This is the game for you if you're a Survival nut. One of the smoothest launches I've seen for an Early Access game. Sure it has its bugs but its day 1 and they already put out 3 hot fixes. Would have taken years for DayZ dev team to do that. Map looks amazing. Great terrain. Must buy
-1	 it dosnt bring very much new stuff to the genere at its current state."
-1	 I got a fisherman's hat! Now that's worth $20."
1	memory leak is pretty gnarly also the game is on the right track just need to focus on fps optimization for now if you are running a 1070-1080ti you may be alot better off as oppose to the people running minimum reqs and min req may be a little too minimum with the 960 the fram with everthing low as low can be 35-40 is max fps
1	 promising future for this game!"
1	Sh!t on people 10/10
1	 this game is hardddd...one that you're going to have to invest alot of time into to be able to get in the higher ranks.(Next update at 5 hours)"
1	I am revering my review after dev updating the game. it feels good it got wrong on the start but getting better for each day but hackers is a problem u can hack with cheat engine rlt lol. But frome that the game is good i reccomend everyone who read this buy it but not the deluxe edition. you only get 2 ingame items and one mystery item when you poop and the rest u find in the game folder which is just images for u to print out what a scam of 8euro
1	Worth it
-1	 unplayeable at key moments. Would not recommend until the game has been further developed."
1	Everything is good but dev need to consider about asian playerthey need official asian server to increase thier product consumegroup of my friends refunded this game because they are lacking of asia serverofficial EU NA EUW SA but still has no official asia server so im gonna wait for that and group of my friend as well.
1	"After the BS that was ""JUST SURVIVE""I was finished with any ""EARLY ACCESS"" titleBut SCUM changed all that for meGood game. Lots of fun.I wanna be a SCUMbag when I grow up!"
1	 monotonous lootin. So far walkin in nature sim."
-1	 15 QUID DOWN DRAIN FFS!!!*******"
1	 good feel so far. Keen to see what is added as it progresses through early access."
1	great game plays great and waaay better survival then any other out right now!!!
-1	Too many HACKERS!!!!! Don't bother until they fix it.  Killed this guy Blue Waffle and some Russian name like 5 times and they kept spawn on me.
-1	"
1	 they dropped the ball and made us pay for a brand new engine instead of the game. This game Scum is so more completed then dayz in EA. Worth the money twice over. Enjoy it people."
1	 but the baseline for this shows some absolutely amazing potential and for only $20."
1	Fun
1	 i just wish there was controller support ( yes i know what your thinking) but thats my only problem. other than that 09/10 very good and a dayz killer for sure."
1	 you guys get it."
1	 Stop being stupid."
1	 they give a single player mode at least so you can try to figure out what you are doing.  I'd say for $20.00 its worth teh support if they actually make a full release game as opposed to perpertually staying in development but still it is fun and at least different to some degree over similar games.  For now i'd say this is a stop gap game for me until Fallout 76 comes out."
-1	 but losing your character is just too much for me. I cannot recommend this game at this stage of early access."
-1	 I by far believe this game has beat all of the these other game that have a terrible launch"
1	 the evidence the devs are updating every day gives me hope and good feeling these are truly the right developers for the job; and know how to run the right game. Releasing a game with decent performance and little to no problems on launch with the exceptional visual and game problems is promising enough.Thank you for reading!"
1	Good so far and more on the way. Yay.
1	for 20$ you cant go wrong and what is here now is great i cant wait for more big updates
1	i hope they fix the multiplayer mode and i need a secure of they downt remove the server and then i lost my progress  please you make a very good game make sure of few stufs i can buy again
1	 especially with friends.people who are complaining are being a little over dramatic.ive played with no server lag and next to no stuttering.My game consisted off trying to live off dog and cat food then eating a giant bag of flour.ate random mushrooms and fungi in the forest (next time gonna eat way more magic mushrooms)shot a deer and chopped it up then a mech shot me into oblivion.plus i peed out of the window at the church tower and pooped on a kitchen table.10/10"
-1	Gameplay=GOODDrop FPS= Baaaaad
1	"SCUM is a hyper realistic ""No items found!"" Simulator."
-1	 not recommended."
1	 full of fun features. Recomended for everyone that likes survival games."
-1	Bad
1	 but they did it. Totally worth a shot!"
-1	 isnt hard ? Wish i can refund back my money. 30 min just for to find a server. And game play ? No content at all ."
1	 difficult to play in the same server as friendsI was able to drown underwater and then regenerate health afterwards. How is this possible?"
1	Ignore all the little kids complaining about the game.It is early access it WILL HAVE BUGS AND ISSUES... don't complain about tiny issues it isn't as if they have said they are releasing a full game. Buy this game it is worth the $20 for sure. The issues (small considering what a fail DayZ Standalone is) will be ironed out soon enough.the game as an early access is a 8/10
-1	 which requires you to spend hours walking in a circle and only looting.I give it 6/10."
1	 then you can sell the fish at a market. Also a trading zone for goods and a general Market place in one location. Perhaps the idea of a Hotel where you can strip for money or spend money on strippers. Maybe a Hotel Brothel owner or an owner of a Pub where you can be taken over by other factions or syndicates. The world is the devs oyster with this game."
1	 and it encourages the recruitment of other players that have skill where you lack it.  There's more I'd talk about but I'm afraid I would bore those reading this. I will edit this in the future as more features come into the game so people can have a general perspective of what the game is like."
1	 but that there exist issues.. that shouldnt be a suprise to anyone ."
1	so far a great game can't wait for the upcoming updates
-1	 but some of that is part of the game and I find that to be very broken and will give some people way to high of an advantage. Just make people visible if they're right in front of you."
-1	same shi.........t as dayz
1	Cream pocket.
1	 id buy it now because i see the price rising"
1	 this game is great and has amazing potential."
-1	Bought 2 copies for my friend and I. Literally the worst game i've ever played. Not even going to reconsider this in the future. This is just straight up garbage. How are 45K+ people playing this?
-1	 but this is not for me ....  I can see this game go like just survive.... way to much things for them to fix."
1	 and did I forget to mention there's events for deathmatch/team deathmatch that you can start at a push of a button that anyone can join? It deffinitely sates peoples hunger for blood that's for sure ;)"
-1	Mech shoots through walls.0/10 ign
-1	Game is pure trash
1	10/10
1	Everything DayZ should have been
1	 I will literally fall asleep or get bored within an hour. Not only that Dayz was not as complicated as this game aims to be. I understand for the sake of realism go make it as realistic as possible but understand that this is a game and so if I swtich over to the Metabolism tab and it ends up making me feel like I am trying to work the shower at a friends house then something isn't right. But it's a work in progress so I'd say the game is worth trying especially at how it was priced. :) 7.8/10 (for now..)"
1	 a little bugs here and there but over all i am extreamly satisfied this game 10/10 would bang again"
1	Very fun! Already seems more polished in some respects than day-z.
1	Thought process is good ....but laggy as hell....if process is good ...will see good things in this game in the future....Giving it a yes for the future no for now
1	It's a grind in the best way possible. Even solo player can be fun - and essential to find out what combo of gear you need to destroy those mechs. Worth $20 all day long and the dev team seem like they're really trying to work to bring this bad boy out of early access.
1	 can't wait to see what the future holds for this game and its players."
1	 but they clearly listen to the community.+"
1	So I have been playing this game for a while and I am enjoying a lot. There are some problems but I'm pretty sure that devs will be fixing those. Interestingly looting is really fun. The crafting system is really detailed. Overall if you liked Dayz you will love this game. Thumbs up for me. I hope devs will be adding  and fixing more stuff to the game.
-1	 and it is fairly reasonable priced so if you never played Dayz then you should give it a go and you most likely wont be to disapointed."
1	 worth every penny.."
-1	 headphones."
-1	Not a lot of things to do at the moment really. very boring running around aimlessly looting places. not much loot anywhere else other than the military places. hackers are still a problem. net code is a mess with people stuttering all over the place when you actually see someone on the map that is. The skill levelling system is really bad. would take weeks to level anything up. on the plus side it does look really great visually. can't really recommend this game yet but hopefully the updates will keep coming and it will get better
-1	 there is no point to play this game right now."
1	 spawn loot die."
-1	 This game? 100% questionable. 20 fps btw"
-1	 wait until there's actually a reason to play it. Right now it's just a junky survival sandbox."
1	Bought SCUM > install > not enough disk space >delete PUBG > play
1	fun game just needs fps work
1	Love it Fun Game Cant wait for new updates
-1	 I don't like scavenging for several hours only to be killed by some a-holes. No I don't want to rent servers to enjoy a game with my friends without pvp. Too bad I've played too long to refund."
1	BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED!
1	 Running and Cupboard Opening Simulator 2018. Despite that I believe in a few months this will be well worth while as it looks great and the key elements are there they just need implementing properly"
1	Very nice game
-1	twitch jebaited
-1	very bad. no hentai. no b00bs.
1	better than day z
1	nices game must buy
1	This game is pretty freaking awesome for an Early Access! It feels completed already!
1	 tons of potential in a fairly stagnant survival market. DEFINITELY WORTH THE $20 PRICE TAG"
1	 or eat them or the other players you have killed. There are even churches to pray for forgiveness. Whats not to like?"
1	 or if you just have something to say in general.btw: I only did not reccomend this game because i wanted it to be seen by the devs and the majority of the populous. I know its a great game.Edit: Just fixed it. If your expieriencing this just exit fullsceen and then re-enter it. is accually really fun."
1	10/10 Just need Optimization.
1	 takes some getting used to and theres a lot of bugs but its early access so thats expected. overall 8/10 would recommend"
1	nais
-1	 the  game will not maximise to fill your screen.I will change this review once they have fixed this."
1	Killed someone then decided i will poop on them 10/10.. totally Recommend.. from what i have played this game is awesome. Some issues with D-sync but this is early access. Big ups to the devs. Weldone!!
1	 still runs and plays better than dayz."
-1	Much ado about running
1	Haven't felt this feeling since dayz mod...  Welp here goes my life again
1	This game is an amazing game i really recommend it to any one thinking about buying it
1	 ARK and PUBG rolled into one. A ways to go due to glitches but for the price? FAIR"
1	 and it can only get better.Would wholeheartedly recommend for the money you literally cannot go wrong."
1	 game has much potential i think and its quite addictive! Recommended in a good price."
1	 I'll start a fundraiser to get the devs put down and I'll sacrifice a dollar bill to Satan."
-1	DayZ Standalone 2.0
1	 anything!"
1	 which is par for the course this early and it's very minor in the long run.  10/10"
-1	 I do not feel like the game is very fun or brings anything new really to the survival genre."
-1	 but the game feels sloppy. Will return to the game in a couple pf months to see how the game has progressed"
1	10/10Would take a crap in the middle of a field again.
-1	SERVERS SUCK PLAYERS ZIP AROUND EVERYWHERE
1	Great game for the fact that it is a alpha. Also you can do nothing wrong with the price. To play the game in high resolution a good pc is required tho.. I hope the developers are perfecting the game so the community can grow and the game can grow to.
1	It only took 4 or 5 days to run 32 hours in this game while i have a ton going on. Needless to say it's DayZ SA with a much faster start and better mechanics. Although some of the status effects are still broken.
1	Not at toxic as rust. Enemies not as broken as Arc. Not as broken or deserted as DayZ. Simple to play and fun to play. Combat is very realistic and satisfying. Fun to sneak past Robots. Even thought its in early access it is very promising. Get it.
1	I like it!
-1	Cons Multiplayer:1.) Multiplayer servers take long to load or not load at all.2.) Servers has no filters or shortcut to join of friends.3.) Hackers lurk in servers and kill you instantly4.) No Anti-Cheat system
1	the game is alright but looting any type of military place is a pain the robots are way powerful which makes it almost impossible with other players and zombies you have to worry about which really sucks
1	very fun and enjoyable nice
1	Ive played 800+ hours of DayZ and i must say that SCUM brings something to the table . Totaly worth a buy. One of the best alfa releases in years if not the best.
1	 forget Rust and all other survival games. This one is the future."
1	The DayZ we all wanted. RIP DayZ Welcom SCUM
1	 they seemed like nice fellas but i couldn't really hear what they were saying. I pulled my knife and screamed ALLAHU AKBAR and started stabbing one of them. Then his mate shot me in the back.10/10 would stab again!"
-1	- Everytime Ive gone up to a person and pvped they just teleport. Big bug...- Server Pop - Server latency- Crashes - Player Movement- Player UI- Gun playPROS: You can take a poop and pee."
1	 It didnt keep attacking it retreated to a safe distant only for me to aggro it later and get knocked out once again."
1	 great work so far!"
1	I hope this is the DayZ killer everyone is dreaming of"
1	this game has a high learning curve; yet it's a blast to play once you get the hang of this games super realistic mechanics. to the developers; you have made an awesome game that i know will stay number one for years to come.
1	 and advance and become famous that way with very little risk of loosing your life or gear."
1	Im trying to enjoy it but pvp is all but impossible. Players lag all over the place. No matter the server i join when meeting a friend or another player the teleport all over. The animals do it also when they run away from you. Please fix this
1	 because this game has incredible potential to grow."
1	>Be me >Fat Boy>Eat food>Start dying to zombie>Eatt Zombie >Yummy
1	 and leaning over the roof and peeing on them. WIN"
1	 i refer this guide... it helped me allot and have more knowledge about certain crafting items.  its a 30 minute video but the guy touches base on important information and early game options. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlft5vl9GI"
1	 or next to a squadmate"
-1	 NO server is true to its posted PING. Right now the servers are a ridiculous joke that need to be fixed before ANYTHING ELSE."
1	 its early access but IMO further along that most others i have purchased."
1	 don't know which game they are playing.I'm playing this game on low budget hardware:-CPU: Amd athlon x4 860K OC'd to 4.4 GHz-GPU: Radeon R7 370 OC'd -other low cost hardware most of it OC'dBeen playing this game on Low to Medium. Even my low budget laptop with an mx150 gpu runs this game (NOT OC'd).After last update 20-30 fps boost. Been enjoying this game. It is fun with friends.BEWARE: EARLY ACCESS"
1	So. Ive been playin SCUM for a little while now and heres my thoughts.Pros:-Good Graphics (Beautiful Nature)-Not too hard-VOIP-UI is pretty good-very realistic (in some ways)-Big mapCons:-Many glitches-Already hackers-Too many zombiesIf you like DayZ you might aswell like this.7/10 - A better DayZ.
1	Scum is a very advanced game I still have alot to learn but for its first day out it shows amazing potential once they fix the desync i think Scum will be almost as good as the arma 2 dayz mod.
1	Day 1 of the release and it's already better than 90% of the survival games on the market. I look forward to what the devs have in store for us on this game; the potential is huge! For $20 this is an easy and definite recommendation for me.
1	gg
-1	 but maybe a little too frustrating to keep you coming back for hours.I guess i'll try again tomorrow...."
-1	 once I set something down I need it 10 minutes later. Backpacks are abysmal. After you use your med pack from the first zombie and you get knicked by another zombie it's like 15-20 minutes to the next town.Conclusion: The game is rough but I supported this developer because they might do this game right and bring us the DayZ that never was?I will re-review the game again in a few weeks."
1	Good game
-1	definately wouldnt recomend yet.
-1	Well would be good if it would start maybe
1	 on GTX1070 and Intel Xeon E3-1231 running on Epic settings with 60-70fps. Keep it up"
-1	Will change to positive once they add a autorun key and bigger servers since the map is way too big for 60 people...
1	 just need to fix the memory leak."
1	 you can gain more weight."
-1	 which is a shame. Shoulda went with UE3 or an alternative. Huge disappointment."
1	 a fresh take on an otherwise stale genre.9/10 just based off the curent mechanics given to us in EA."
1	 pistols and plenty of food within the smaller towns. My only gripe is that high end gear is too easy to find in the areas guarded by robots.  Hopefully the game doesn't die like many other survival games before it."
-1	 game is unplayable once a cheater gets a hold of you"
1	Poop and Pee on the ground whenever you desire it. Best Game ever 10/10
1	 that bear -_-"
1	 THIS is how you do early acces game.Vozdra."
1	 facing away from me.PANIC SPRAY. He dies.He donates his submachine gun and tons of ammo to my cause.I beat the game. Log out to play later.Can't wait 'till someone wastes me from behind with a half-loaded pistol and takes a dump on my corpse."
-1	 When you're done I'll start playing again :)"
1	 Gold. You must remember this is ""Early Access"""
1	Amazing game!Nice one!
-1	 I just didn't have any fun."
1	 when they update th game."
-1	costs 20 euros a month for a server. Maybe once it's released its better but don't buy it for now."

1	 been waiting on this one for a while and as long as the devs keep updates rolling it'll end up a great game."
1	 highly anticipated and has followed through with my expectations."
-1	 but not unplayable kind of bad."
1	pretty good game
1	One of the best games i ever played
1	Deserves a double tap.
1	prepare to poop. again.
-1	theres chinese people hacking this game rn :( its a good game but to much hackers. In need of a better anti-cheat engine.
1	great game but needs alot of fix/updates
-1	Early Access? CheckSurvival? CheckOpen World? CheckZombies? CheckLooks like we got everything we need for a bland survival game boys.
1	 its only going to go uphill form here."
-1	 player numbers will decline and the game will die except for some hardcore fans who complain that there aren't any new players.  I guess it is the inherent downfall of all these ""survival games"" that they cannibalize their own player base."
1	So far i had a blast ...its need a couple of tweaks here and there but devs are really active they eventually fix and make the game better .note that you need a nice rig for now so beware before buying it
-1	nothing to really do than just walk and run for hours and hours and hard to play with friends. Wish there will be more update to come. Let scum a chance"
1	 buy it and if you don't like it within two hours refund it and rebuy it in a year. I love it though. Amazing start for a small dev team in my opinion."
-1	No.
1	Great potential.It's a proper survival game. Slow-paced. Thoughtful. Any game that makes you consider whether you need a dump before you take on a heavily guarded outpost is always going to be a winner.I actually got a hatchet to the back of the head while having a pish. I wasn't even mad.
-1	booooring ;)
1	No regrets =)
1	 killing him.We chop up our dead friend for meat. I out his head in my backpack. I give my friend his severed head when he responded. 11/10"
1	 so good dev team to keep it going. Just give it a shot and you might be surprised...or wait until they optimize their servers."
1	 it is worth it"
1	 but I heard that they will be adding base building later down the line. But this game is really amazing and it is worth the 20 bucks. Really good hardcore survival game with ok pvp."
-1	 boring as hell even when you run across someone and team up....they might kill you when shooting at a zombie with you standing behind them.....wrap your head around that. The game MIST is more enteraining then this."
-1	 poor execution."
-1	 but for now I've gotta downvote."
1	I suggest the game it's great.
1	can't believe you take a dump with your pants onjesus christI LOVE IT
1	 does it better than Dayz I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone you will not be disapointed."
1	Dying of multiple diseases has never been more fun
1	 or clogged with trolls and abandoned bases on all the servers that make multi-player and co-op games unplayable."
-1	Meh walking simulator for 90% of the gameplay.
1	 it has sold over 750K copies since release. impressive right. I would say its worth a buy"
1	I really enjoy the game even though I hate games were you can lose your items in a heart beat. It is really fun for even playing alone because of the zombies. I just hate the spawns like when you spawn miles away from a town.
-1	`really hard not for people who just chill and ply
1	This game will be pretty good next year.
-1	 and game using EasyAnticheat  - this game is 100% unplayable cuz of hackers."
1	 right now. I very much expect a price raise (60 dollars or so) It is that durned good! Come join in on the fun!"
1	This game needs to add more zombies fix up some lag bugs while in combat and maybe more items and wepons in the game. Also add dirt bikes and quads
1	First survival game I've played in all honesty but fun and easy enough to pick up in time. Looking forward to more content as the developers progress with it and great support for the first two weeks or so
1	 most likely you'll run this game in a few months to find out its got a complete story you can play through."
1	Took a poop in the forest and a apple appear where my poop was. 10/10
1	 good game."
-1	 i almost feel like its the same developers in disguise..."
1	skills and balanced weight triangle  Map detail Balanced loot tablesBalanced progressionShooting Movement Bad game mechanics / ishuse  Be aware that some of these could be patch when you are reading this Mildly steep learning curve  could be fixed with tutorial Broken camoflage skil e.g. seeing tent doors at airfield opening and closeing one by one with no visible player (I was close)I cant think of any thing more i geuss thats good"
-1	so I played this game for an hour and in that hour I died 6 times to hackers killing the entire server instantly.
1	 and I am certain that is most definately coming. It's like what Dayz should've been. Goodluck to the dev's and I look forward to spending many hours in game."
1	 what do you guys expect from a  SURVIVAL GAME .  The gaming community should keep an open mind since this game just came out and should stop comparing it to all the other games on the market.  Through our support I'm sure this game could reach its full potential and become one of the best Open World Survival games on the market.  10/10"
1	 would buy new pc just for this game.6. Rip DayZ"
-1	 dev team doesnt work too hard (considering the ammount of locked content and game performance).Wouldn't recommend buying unless you have RTX 2080ti and an i9 to run it smoothly.CRAP!"
-1	 apply patches quite quickly (thanks for HOR+ ultrawide fix)Will check the game here and there after a few updates and give a recommendation if/ once it hits a state where it is an enjoyable game worth the price."
1	 except... the mechs are OP so don't go near them."
1	I have been Scummed.
-1	The game is already riddled with hackers. I recommend waiting until release before buying or at least waiting until they fix the anti-cheat.
1	Amazing open world shooter with zombies and mechs.
1	Great game :)Great DevsWaiting to see how the game unfolds.Netcode needs some work / Military gear needs to have alot less drops.Beautiful rain / scenery.
-1	game spose to be a open world survival game to me its just a full on pvp shooter game
1	 something about the atmosphere and design keep you hooked. So bring a friend or make friends in game.Push to Talk- its a thing. Ive begged for my life a number of times........Fun Factor- Increases with people. Decreases with death. You wont be going back for your body with much success.Things I wish for- Sleeping aka sleeping bags or cots for logging out and faster recovery of HP. Also allow for improved                              treatment by other players."
1	 my life in ruins. Where am I? What have I become? Nothingness.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwk-P2H8tOw"
1	The game that scratched my Arma 2 DayZ itch. Worth way more than 20$
-1	As Great as this game is the servers are awfull asoon as it max out there is to much lag and teleporting making the worse combat of anygame ive ever played
1	 but very good game"
1	Is good
1	 it's such a well thought out and in-depth game. You can see that there's an awful lot of scope to build very detail modelling of behaviours and other systems into the game. Looking forward to a massive increase in the ""crafting tree"". And can see myself playing this for a considerable amount of time!Well done devs keep up the good work!"
1	 this has done it off the bat."
1	 and nutrition more than my own."
1	 it'll be a backup game. I truly look foward to seeing what comes next. Developers are active and showing interest in the product even after a massive payday."
1	 my review shall be revised to fit in all the final game stuff as well."
-1	 we'll see what devs will do."
1	 got explosive diarrhea. 10/10"
1	 and there will be much added soon. This game has potential!"
1	 but it would be nice for us who don't have the ability to play online with friends all the time. Keep up the good work devs!!"
1	...I like it!!
1	Dont judge this game after just 1-2 hoursi had to play about 4 hours before i decidedand it is really funthe devs also seem to be working hard on iteveryone who says this game isnt finished and is another dayzITS EARLY ACCESS!!!!what did you expect and on top of that its been out for about a weekyes this game could end up being another dayz but we will have to wait and see what the devs do
1	Let's me drop logs on my dead enemies 10/10
-1	 you are lucky to relocate your corpse to claim your stuffBasically if you want to play a carbon copy of every other zombie survival game and convince youself that its different because of the title screen this is the title for you."
1	 you're going to sh!t."
1	 i recommend this!"
1	 devs have built a solid base for a survival game. Now comes time to tighten everything up and to start to add content."
-1	trash
1	very fun. dont listen to all the negatives....they are prob fortnite players
1	when he gets up he flies up in the air and breaks his leg upon landing. God I love this game 10/10.PS I pooped on his head when he was afk."
1	 DayZ how it should have been."
1	 I like scum. Wish they hurried and addded vehicles already."
1	 7.8 turds rolling down my shelter roof out of 10."
1	 from bad optimization to the lack of vehicles to travel the ENORMOUS map(they plan to add these AFAIK). But the base game is very fun especially with a group of friends.I honestly don't think for 20 USD you can get much better.7/10 (but an easy 9 if they fix the server lag and optimization)"
1	a game with huge potential. the pvp is fun and i hope that future updates will bring more weapons & other weapon attachments.10/10
-1	Game is good but desperately needs more map densityAlso fix this terrible memory leak that makes your game run poorly after a while playing!
1	 16 Gigs ram but i still dont get 60 fps Hight settings - 47 FPSEpic settings - 49 FPSmediuim - 32 FPSlow - 31 FPSDoes anyone have a tip? ive tried all the BS ''FPS BOOST TURTORIAL'''s but i still don't get good frames..."
1	 but damn if this game isn't what everyone wanted DayZ to be."
1	 this game is Great! is one big MIX bethewnArk/PUBG and more!  9/10"
-1	 but I love a game that has smooth character control more. It honestly made me want to play Miscreated. If this game had character control similiar to miscreated it would be a solid 10/10."
1	 and the crafting has a nice depth to it."
-1	"It's Like DayZ (Standalone) & Miscreated had a baby and called it ""Scum"" before it had the chance to go to school and bullied for how deformed and mangled it looked."
1	This gajm is really gut
-1	as it stands its a great game with alot of promise.......server with full pop everyone lags and teleports....medium pop not as bad unless u have russians on american servers.....low pop ez no teleporting games ok........WAIT UNTIL THEY FIX THE SERVERS [YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED]
1	 you join in by paying with fame points. Other than that it's just you surviving alone or making camps with friends and enjoying your time in the world.Personally SCUM is what DayZ and Miscreated could have been if the devs actually put in effort to release the game. I stopped supporting Early Access for a few years because of the scam that was Miscreated but SCUM has brought me back in. Personally I think SCUM has a lot of potential and deserves the attention it's getting now. Ignore the mixed reviews and it give it a chance or come back in a few months time would be my recommendation."
1	The best early access game i have ever encountered!Feels like a finished game already.Highly recommended for any survival games fan.
1	 you wont be disappointed."
1	 the hyper-realistic aspect is all one could really be looking for in a survival game."
1	gr8 game
-1	 the bugs and teleporting is too much of a draw back."
1	Its very much like Dayz but much better with a single player option which is great. The game runs well on my W7 pc and this game has death match modes aswell as SP and MP survival and its at a good price. Nice job Devs !!
1	RIP DAY Z.
1	SCUM is a good game and a nice twist on this genre. I have read a few comments about the game being bad and saying the loot impossible to find. In my experience loot is reasonably easy to come by. The only negatives I've come across are a few occasional bugs where you cant open doors or you will spawn in a slightly different place to where you logged off. Aside from that the man seems solid and might not have the best gunplay right now but it still feels decent. The game will go up from here and it's already better than dayz
1	looking like being one of the greats you can tell the devs are passionate on delivering a game the world can enjoy. All the negative reviews are from brain dead gamers who dont realise this is an early access release so the game is obviously not finished and other content will be added. For an early access game im very impressed with the gameplay and the graphics i look forward to playing this game for the years to come. Our server is #1785 Europe if anybody would like to help me and my crew to populate it. thanks
1	fun but mechs are insanley hard to get past but 10/10.
-1	 apart from the speed being managed through the middle-wheel detail. There's a good amount of stamina so you don't bore yourself stopping all the time.I managed to find a deer which escaped when I got close. That's to be expected and worked well.Not much more I can say since I wish to refund this game before the 2-hour frame period."
1	 and the zombie jumped all over the wall and killed me. If you  could atlest reduse the Jump a bit so they atlest can't jump over bigger walls/ fences!"
1	Everything Dayz wanted to be. Only scum is already there and dayz isn't even close.
-1	is bad
1	 if you're on the bottom floor you can sometime see/pickup items from the floor above you10/10 Game so far."
1	 DayZ is starting to have a much stronger contester. No doubt that after a year of development it could exceed DayZ as it's potential is powerful."
1	 it felt like I've barely started the game.THIS REVIEW MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE"
1	 and to launch with so little bugs is very impressive in this particular genre. Although it is similar to a few other games it shines as it's own thing! Best $20 on STEAM HANDS DOWN!"
1	Great game with a lot of potential. It's like walking dead meets hunger games.
1	 but as I say it's an EA game."
1	insane
-1	me no lik
-1	people teleport around realism way to overrated in this game.
-1	Wouldn't recommend due to too early to enjoy as not enough things to do
-1	btec dayz
-1	 Low fps plus lack of any real content besides running around and occasionally shooting makes this game too boring to leave a positive review."
1	 but I was willing to throw in the extra 10 for what might become the survival game I've been lookingfor for years."
1	One of the best survival games in every aspect.
1	 running off at the speed of light. 10/10"
1	Hit a horse in the head with a large rock. Beat a zombie to death with a pitchfork for a dope track suit. Bled out after being shot by a giant robot. IGN 8/10
1	 I can comfortably say this team has put together a game that has FAR exceeded my expectations and their quick response to bugs and issues with hackers gives me confidence that this is going to be a good ride for years to come. 5 out of 5 as far as I'm concerned. Just make sure you guys give us helicopters and support for HOTAS and TrackIR in the future."
1	 and has some cool features. the first guy i ran into though. just lagged around me and killed me. literally telporting 2-3 meters to the right or left."
1	Early access game with its own issues .. That said .. DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! The game has carzy simulations about everything .... when you run from a zombi and you have to stop because you  over eat and had on the spot diarea .... 10/10 game haha !  I really love the in depht simulation of this game here with very well done game mechanics ... while its still early it really has a solid foundation to start with .. in other words .. i love this game !
1	 this is a reccomend for you."
1	 I am still support this game as it can play well than other games survival."
1	 and with some time and polish this title will be even more amazing than it already is. I feel this is already better than DayZ and its just come out. Only time will tell."
1	The poop has more physics than DayZ and PUBG 10/10
1	Better than Dayz
-1	 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1	 or feel you have to ask ""what do you do in this?"" or ""how do you win?"" this might not be for you and I'd advice waiting until more features are available before considering a purchase."
1	Definitely one of the better early access survival out there
1	 pick it up."
-1	Game doesnt make fun
1	 a great experience playing the game so far and I hope the Devs continue to work on it and perfect.Devs are doing a great job thanks for the awesome game."
1	imagine DayZ with loot...
1	ChingChongKwayla.
-1	Love the feature where the game runs after you close it and you end up logging 45 hours and cant return it... 13/11 would eat beans again
1	 not its current state"
1	..... This will be a great game eventually....Please don't let us down Dev's........"
1	I bought the game in  advanced because it has some serious potential
1	 and it's great. It's better than i expected :d (Still needs improvement though...)"
1	Best Survival Game so far
1	 if you hate it get a refund."
1	 or dehydrate as soon as you log in. You are able to travel and not worry to much as there is a good amount of resources to use around you."
1	 but you need a good pc to paly it!"
1	Please add controller support!!!
1	Game looks nice but you canot play whit GTX750 25 fps ..
1	 deer runs away with the spear in its head>mfw left with no spear12/10"
1	i like the game. tobad im only going guarded places cuz thats the only good spot. towns need a little more loot tbh
-1	Too much lag
1	my dream game with single player peace.. Rip dayz..
1	 but because you care.Thank you."
1	 but I don't expect this to be a finished product. From what they brought to the table already this is amazing. Already a more polished and fluid experience compared to any other game in its Genre. I can't wait to see what else gets released and how events unfold."
1	 even stock pile a few sets in containers by your shelter you think you've hidden like a pro. Too e z"
1	"
1	7/10 now9/10 in twelve months time
-1	No item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was found
1	 worth your money and support."
1	 and the culling had a baby this would be it! XD poeple are upset the servers are crashing and giving the game a bad review when all you need to do is exit steam restart and update. thats why the servers are crashing LOL."
1	 but It will be a really good game once it grows."
1	 i love it"
-1	game cant even launch ....
1	Awsome game
1	My Dayz replacement ? Its looking like it...
1	GOTY 2018
-1	 save it; because the average player will come away frustrated or board out of their minds."
1	Good change of pace from other survivals
1	dayz but you can poop and fight metal gears
1	 Do you want to get in now or want to jump in once the pool is full w/ scum?"
-1	Walking Simulator
1	game is a really good with a huge potentional but net code is garbage
1	 but the random encounters you experience with your squad/friends is going to make this game worthwhile."
1	I have been waiting ages for the DayZ Killer to arrive! MUAHAHA 10/10 for an early access game!
1	It's not the game that made me give this a positive review. It's not the fun aspect of looting and surviving. It's not the good graphics and excellent mapsize and map quality.It's the devs. The devs are helpful and love the player base
-1	 definitely skip it if you don't like solo play with abominable lag every time you're not the only person on screen."
-1	dont recomend for low end pc users it runs horribly 10-20 fps on lowest graphics needs to be better optimized
1	This game reminds me old times I had with Arma 2 DayZ mod. 10/10
1	 but right now... it ends up being a bit boring."
-1	DayZ 2. Meh.
1	 I got nothing but love for you.  Thanks for the game."
-1	Just not for me
1	 and PvP/PvE than DayZ"
1	Brilliant. Just brilliant!
1	 improving on a daily basis."
-1	 medicine does not work...i do not think you would stop to vomit and get killed if you are chased by a herd of zombies... the list continues..."
-1	 not even food that you need to survive... Not giving it another hour."
1	 coming to this realization we grouped up and i headed us back to our main groups meeting point where the rest of our team was our group now 23 strong we took over the airport and setup a new home inside one of the hangers.After many days at our hanger compound collecting loot from the airfield and it's underground base we found multiple grenades rocket launchers and set out to kill one of these mechs through trial an error we worked out how to do it an started clearing the airfield of mechs word got out that we were not to be f**ked with an that the airfield was now a safe haven for all.We lived gloriously for the rest of our lives  10/10 would do it all again.GAME IS F**KING AWESOME BUY ITIt's what Day Z should of been it's what Miscreated tries to be it's what H1Z1 couldn't fathom to be it is what the War Z aka Infestation Z dreams of it's the new top dog of survival game's."
1	 and a patch was released that fixed the server issues and optimized game"
1	 hop in and have fun."
-1	 which is nearly essential to a literal S U R V I V A L game. How is running around and dying over and over survival."
1	 this game is spectacular. It looks beautiful on ANY graphics preset and runs well at recommended specs. This is a game you can really get immersed in."
1	000 dollars with pretty much high end specs yet i get 30 fps outside and 40 inside yet I have over recomended specs for your pc and it runs like that so hopefully they make performence improvments but yeah it's weird i don't like running games at 30 fps with turned down settings"
1	This is a great game!
1	Requires Harverd Graduation to under stand the game
1	 very impressive given its early access. Plenty of playability in its current state and definitely looking forward to seeing how this one grows/improves with time."
1	Basically Dayz ..  but better.  12.5/10
1	 when you play single player you dont get any story why you just spawn in the middle of the forest and zombies are way over powered in my opinion. Also it would be cool if there was like AI colonies in single player where you can make friends and create your own town and get attacked or attack other colonies. Overall if the developers keeep updating the game and putting their hardest effort the game can get huge."
-1	IT WAS SO EMPTY
1	 I recommend you to look up some beginner-guides on youtube."
1	I love this game.. :)
1	 killing is either too easy or it's ""o hai im hack0rz ur ded""-MOAR animals please! (wiiiith invincible Witcher-style kitties if it's not too much trouble pls :)"
1	 but right from the beggining you are able to get the materials to craft throwing spears which can one hit zombies.For the price this game is being sold... its very very much worth it!"
-1	 but you'd then find 22 ammo and an AK magazine."
1	i just love walking and looting.
-1	The game as an idea is very good. However having spent nearly an hour trying to get started due to a lack of walkthrough tutorials on how the basics work and the constant glitches and crashes I had enough. Only to be told by steam I could not claim a refund as I had gone over the 2 Hours gameplay they deem is sufficient to be able to see if its a game you like. It is a game I would probably enjoy but it has way to many glitches and should be pulled by either steam or the developer until they have it sorted! Very disappointed in both companies with the lack of support.
-1	at  the moment i would not recommend this game as I spent 2.7 hours getting gear to die to a player that i shot 20 bullets into but apearently he killed me with an axe because of the lag.
1	 however it helps the development of the game. Thanks :)"
1	 but its all worth it when u start getting into shoot outs. my only problem i have with the game is server issues and a severe memory leak issue that has yet to be resolved developers have been working around the clock and have been putting out patches almost eveyday since launch so i can live with it for now.so far this game is extremely worth it for the $20 price tag and it is one of the best survival games i have played to date!"
1	6 patches in 8 days. This game is gonna become very good. It's already fun but they are gonna add like a ton of more content.
1	 good game concept."
1	SCUM has a great foundation. The devs are extremely responsive and quick to add updates/fixes. If you are a fan of exploration and survival games I believe SCUM is a great choice.
-1	 run!  and run and run and run and run"
1	Better than DayZ already.
1	 just bad lag for now."
-1	 literally."
-1	So after around 6 Hours of streaming the new game Scum I went for a refund on it. The game is lacking so much as a survival game and well its nothing more than a running simulator. I give it a 4/10 they still have a lot of work to do to make that worthy of playing. You can see my full stream here -> https://www.twitch.tv/videos/303454254
1	 I would have recommended this game if it were $49.99 and I can also confidently say that based on this games content on it's first day of public release? I can't even imagine what these dev's have planned for the future and I would highly recommend getting this game as soon as you can because it's only $19.99 and over time will increase in price based on the content it releases and the more content there is to play.I would get it now at it's cheapest price. But if it came down to it I would have paid $59.99...Good job dev's!"
-1	 drink stuff and eat makes the game feel like a chugging bore.  Couldn't get into the game as much as I would have liked to and I found the overall gameplay to be monotonous and boring.Don't like what I had to say?  Then I welcome you to email me your thoughts about the game at DON'TPLAYHTHISGAME@GMAIL.COM"
-1	 taking down 5 fully geard guys with one pistol... GG this game needs major help....oh did i mention there is no way to report hackers?if you take away anything from this review please wait till they implement ANY sort of anticheat and/or a report system"
1	 it is worth the money for now. If you are looking a fully functioning game and would rather wait for the official release you will be paying more money down the road. I bought it knowing that I will be playing it on and off because of the early access aspect."
-1	 only for me to rubberband around a wall and all of the shots having missed.In its current state I can not recomend this game due to how broken the PVP feels and how often that becomes an issue."
1	 the mechanics are stunning and the game in itself is a wonder to behold"
-1	3yrstooearly
1	 took crowbar.and then I pooped on him.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150298528010/10"
1	 lol."
-1	garbage
1	 this is not it.  This feels like it can be THE survival game a lot of us have been looking for."
1	 you'll find yourself with a great gaming experince."
1	 then i ate a watermelon and died 10/10 will play again. I also pooped on my friend!"
-1	 performance. In short: It runs like dog turd. I have turned all settings to minimum at 50% render resolution and its still difficult to break 40fps with my GTX 1080. After a few minutes this drops to 15fps.I will gladly change my review to recommended once the performance issues are fixed.I really want to play more but can't with this performance.I recommend waiting a week or two and hopefully they'll fix these issues."
1	 although it may be better if sprinting was still on shift with the shift-scroll to adjust speeds as needed. The only weapon I was able to find in over an hour was a spade. I couldn't even find a tree limb to use as a club or for crafting. Overall I have to say I like the inovative features in this and I hope they use EA to continue to polish and work on this."
1	 like wtf.Anyway. Yeh get this game :)"
-1	Would be great game if it worked :)
-1	 but for now I am refunding."
1	Died to sodium 3 times in 4 hours top notch game
1	the new and improved DayZ :)
-1	 everything is too spaced out and you always find poor quality loot to not even make it worthwhile.So far this game isn't worth it as other mods / games do a better job of what this game is doing."
1	Typical EA response. The game is pretty sick. There are defnitely some things that need to be reworked or implemented.  But overall this is very addicting.
-1	Overwhelmingly average in all respects.
1	 it's still a pretty good game. I can't wait to see where it is in 6-months from now because what's currently here shows a ton of potential."
-1	MEH
-1	I do not recomend the game in its current state it has a hacker problem
1	 even in these early stages!"
1	Scum > DayZGive it 1 year and it will be a really good survival Game.
-1	boring after ten minutes... running simulator.....
1	Absolutely love this game already. great content for early access and ive found very few issues which in time I know will be fixed. Definitely reccommend playing this.
1	 once vechicles are intoduced i feel like the game will be a lot better since you wont need to spend half of the playtime running around. Get the game now before the price gets jacked up because the game has a lot of potential.  :3"
1	ESC--- Commit Suicide Best feature instead of trying to kill yourself.10/10
1	 and yes i would recommend this game to everyone i know.----PS CRREAM TOLD ME TO PUT THE GAME AS POSITIVE"
1	 scum is lifeThis Game Is Great! Better W/ Friends!Can't wait for features to come to the game. Driving would be super niceThere is a lot of running around. So if you don't like that. Do not get this game. But For Me 9/10 Till It gets full release. Add Me If Ya Wanna Play!"
1	 looking forward to the updates!  Will update review after more play time."
1	fun
-1	 Horrible server performance when in combat (teleporting players)TLDR; A rubberbanding walk simulator"
1	 very good"
1	very nice
1	What DayZ should have been. Still buggy but yeah it's early access.
1	 and prairies I've seen in a video game. The twist of mechs guarding the best loot is fabulous. For only $20 it is a steal!"
1	Watch it rising to the top along PUBG and Fortnite.
1	 and its goooooone.... + Still better than RL - RIP Fps  - Needs a Toilet Paper in the game - My grandmother runs better than this game"
1	I'm really enjoying this game. You expect a few bugs and issues at the start as its early access.
-1	 unoptimised and has cheaters. Wait on this one and see if it improves."
-1	fun but gets frustrating very fast the crafting system is not good needs lots of work.  you collect everything you need to male an item and then for some reason it will not make said item if there is another reason for this it would be nice if it told you why.
-1	The worst game i've ever played.
-1	Early Access for sure! The game it self is ok in some ways but the servers are horrible. The map is huge so with the low caps of players makes it impossible to have fun. It's like running around and around and around and around. Not impressed at all.
1	 pleanty of things to do and not too glitchy for a early access. Although there are some unnecessary complex mechanics that don't need to exist like a lot of the metabolism information."
1	Very intersting game and very good optimised !!!Thumbs up for you Also checkout my yt chanel and my twich acc when i livestream almost evrydayYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9IYYH_mxX2TLLZ2AkDfzYQ/featured?disable_polymer=true My youtube chanel where i will be posting 1 to 3 videos evry week-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/1ramzezz1 I stream once or twice a week so follow me-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	Really cool game. I truely hope they're able to sort out the netcode between players. I see the $20 bucks as an investment & am recommending on that basis.
1	 hunting system is working really well too. And the Mechs (robot) are getting fix soon in patches. For 20$ jump in and enjoy before price rise up. ***"
1	The Best Survival PVE/PVP game at this time !!!! To be in ur library no problem.THx to have made this game...... :o)
1	 but I genuinely believe even in its current state that it's a better game than DayZ is even after five years in development."
-1	wait a while I would say to myself a day or two ago.if I knew what I Know right about. now."
1	I had been looting for a good amount of time and had pretty good gear. Then I met two germans who seemed friendly at first. One of them asked me how to open a conserve and then the other guy shot me in the face. Now my sole purpose is to avenge my death. 10/10 would die to a unfriendly german again.
1	 the discord has a bunch of fireteam channels to group up with other players and help get a quick start. the metabolism system is a great mechanic; for those without any idea on proper nutritional dieting for your own health this is a great way to learn as you play. THIS IS EVERYTHING DAYZ COULD HAVE BEEN AND MORE. LOVE IT!!!!!!"
1	 oWo Croatia"
1	the only survival game that i was brave enough to try... and i don't feel sorry about it. now addicted to it. great to play with friends but also alone.
1	Still a better game than H1Z1 and DayZ combined !
-1	Wow.  I hope it gets better.  Would have rather given $20 to a homeless person if I knew it was going to be this bad and frustrating.
1	 but thats just me."
-1	It's.. so.. boring...
1	Awesome Game! :)
1	 which will most likely be added in the near future.-they just added a working anti-cheat :DTHE BAD (temporal things)-the optimization is really bad. Even the guys with overkill rigs get low FPS so if you dont have a gaming PC it is going to be very unplayable. I know this situation will improve over time.They are real hard working devs and in the past few devs my performance has increased <3 and it is only going to get better."
-1	This game reminds me too much of Day Z...A lot of running...Little to no loot...Feeling hungry? Too bad.Feeling dehydrated? Too bad.Need to heal? Too bad.Found a gun but no ammo? Too bad.Change name from Scum to No Item Found.
-1	 the desync makes it unplayable for me."
1	 look no further."
1	A fun survival game with more depth than I expected. Great to play with friends. It will be perfect once the new content is released.
1	 long live the king (SCUM) !!!"
-1	 high loot areas already filled up with campers that already has military gear and lots of guns and they will kill you before you get into building.So yeah in my opinion this game shouldnt be out yet in current state i asked for refund they didnt accepted it bc i have 11 hours they say i should have lower than 2 hours of game time to ask for a refund so keep that in mind if you want refund..."
1	 really fun but can be frustrating some times.I rate this game: 7.5/10Give it a try!"
1	Amazing game 10/10 right now considering it's in early access. One thing wrong with it is there is a not steep enough learning curve but as long as this game keeps on with it's current road map it will become one of the best or even THE best hardcore PvP survival game out there. Amazing work guys!
-1	garabge game opens on second moniter wont let you change moniter
1	 a stunning map and the usual player interactions you expect in this sort of game.8/10 looking forward to what's to come."
1	but recently when i join a server i keep getting kicked for my easyanticheat. idk what is going on but i hope they fix it soon..."
1	 BEAUTIFULLY well made!"
1	 you can always refund the game if you only put 2-3 hours into it and don't like it."
1	 it was a pleasant thing to find it was both unexpected and yet very realistic for the situation - yeah I dont want to spoil those moments for anyone.Well tried not to go too long but give some insight - hope this was helpful to at least a few.-del"
-1	 but it's just not fun at the moment."
1	Best start to a survival game so far! 10/10 would buy again just to help the development of this game
1	 maybe atleast watch the trailer before you play ..."
-1	This early access game is way too rough.  The game crashed every single time with out of video memory error.  Perhaps it only works with high end setups.  My 1050Ti 4GB can't run it without crashing.
1	 where that potential heads is up to the Devs."
1	Has a potential to be a great game.
-1	boring AF
-1	BRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFT *plop* SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
1	Survival Game with a lot of potencial!
1	dayz was a gam. scumk is a gam. snumk is beeter. it pased the frog test. thum up
-1	 game seems pretty good besides the sponge from people absorbing 30+ hatchet hits. I'll edit this review in a month if things change."
1	Not even an hour in but already having a blast! Some server issues here and there but that's to be expected of a game that's just released in early access. This game is promising to be great!
-1	 and dying. So fun.........."
1	For the first time in a long time a survival game released how it was ment to. Can't wait to see what this game brings.
1	Going to be the best survival game to date just needs time to blossom!
1	Best survival game I have played so far. Finally devs that know what they're doing!
1	You may not like the game in the first 2.5 hours. But you will love it the more you play it. Tipp: Play sneaky and don't risk anything.
1	This game should give lessons to the AAA developers. Game is amazingly beautiful. 1000% better than dayZ. The fame points system and event modes are awesome. The only thing I would complain about is that there are no South African Servers wich forces me to play with 200 ping.
1	 but it's got it's charm :)"
-1	Game is great fun but latest patch breakes the fov fix[/script/engine.localplayer]AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainYFOVLooks like im viewing through a magnifying glass now.
-1	 its a tech demo."
1	 everyone praisaes the overall beauty of the environments (wich I second too) but the skymap is awful at night."
1	I was enjoying a beautiful sunset. Then a goat came around and mowed me down. Died because of blood loss10/10 never seen something like this
-1	 they causes you to die most of the times from random things."
1	dont have many asian server . food easy to find but weapon and ammo so very rare to find. The game got lot of potential . XD
-1	Another DayZ. Kill on sight galore.
1	 heavy survival mgmt so its a fun option if you dont like multiplayer or just want to learn the game mechanix.Im not sure why people dont like this."
-1	The lag during a gunfight is unreal when the guy is in your sights and all of a sudden hes 5 feet to the right is not a playable game. Once fixed il look into the game more.
1	this game is very engaging and it going to be veery good when it is fiished
1	 rust and miscreated it's like a mashup of all games combined"
1	its nice
1	love this game. obviously not finished but its the beta. can't wait to see what they do with the game. i reccomend a buy to support and play cuz its pretty fun as is
-1	hello im so mad right now please remove the idiot robots they are so annoying remove them please.
1	so far i've played 20 hours on this game and i gotta tell ya it's hella fine
-1	 hard hitting lag spikes. And the overall gaveplay is just dingy...#refunded"
1	 the game world is nice as well as the survival mechanics. A welcome addition is the Hunting mechanic when you are searching for food.Needs Fishing which i believe the Devs are working on. has recieved numerous hotfixes and patches since its release.Server optimisation is needed and again i believe the developers have this as a priority.If the devs do not drop the ball  this promising game it could become the survival game that Dayz inspired to be."
1	 since the game is just out I would hope so.  Let's see if that stays the case."
-1	fail to fine server
1	Love the game! Promising future
-1	44 fps@1080p nvidia 970 all low..... uhm
1	 let's hope the devs take this wonderful foundation and build us an even more amazing house to play around in."
-1	 let the developers work for their money by actually making the game playable."
1	Guuccci
-1	 there's no way I could recommend that anyone buy a walking simulator that has all of the free roam certification of ArmA and none of the charm (or loot availability) of PubG. Wait for further updates."
1	 SCUM is already the best survival game ever."
-1	 it can improve greatly or fail miserably."
1	 However bear with the game and what you have is an absolute pleasure and a laugh to play.Only 25 Hours in but far superior to PUB-G and DayZ neither of which i enjoyed.I cant wait to see how the game developes as it matures."
1	really enjoying it so far
1	 very exited for this game"
1	 get a clue.  Can't wait to see whats added to the game in the future."
1	 i'm running it and i don't even meet the Minimum Requirementsm"
1	 but every update forwhatever reason never wants to download properly.. 40mb updates want to take 40hrs to download before finally coming down to 20 mins with a 30 min install. seems glitchy in that aspect as this is my only steam game this happens too. weird.."
-1	I would recommend you get it after early access because it is a great idea/concept but it needs some time to fix everything and develop a whole lot more. Also the traveling to SOOOO much time they need to add cars.
-1	 I got my $20 worth and am happy with the purchase. I can only hope that one day the game will play without too many issues. We'll see."
1	 outstanding game.  Cant wait to see what comes next."
-1	 there was a lot of hype. But my review is: meh."
1	 the dev's are doing a really good job at communicating and attempting to address concerns. 10 of 10 will poop in unfortunate times again."
-1	Very dissappointed. this game LACKS material. do not waste your money untill they make another update and add game content. i would return this and get my moneyt back if i could. https://store.steampowered.com/app/513710/SCUM/#
1	 but devs seem to be on top of things and the game seems very promising."
1	Arma 3 Exile meets Hunger Games meets German Porn. Dope.
1	 would be fed own corpse again."
-1	I cannot recommend this game as we cannot host our own servers on our own machines.
1	KAFANA JE MOJA SUDBINAAAAONA ME JE SEBI UZELAAAAKAFANA JE MOJA ISTINAAAAA
1	 something i hope will come later.Game score:Early access ready 9/10Game 8/10 Loot 8/10Fixing of bugs/updates 9/10Price 10/10"
-1	 none of them worked."
1	best 20 spent in a long time.Get it."
1	 grab it up!"
-1	Game has potential however situation with the robots locking on and one tapping you no matter what gear you're wearing just becomes old and repetitive.Will update review when new patches are released.
-1	RIP Game... these hackers everywhere <3
1	 whould be a lot better if you just removed 3:d person!"
-1	 it is not suitable for release at this point in my opinion."
-1	 update and fix your engine."
1	just started playing and i love this game. 8/10 so far. also just started a server and im looking for admins. Americas Most Wanted    172.107.179.169:28202
-1	STILL CAN NOT GET ON THIS GAME DUE TO SECURITY ISSUES FFS ......15 quid down the pan I WILL NOT RECOMEND .......
1	 DayZ has been dead for a long time now and this game cannot be said to kill something which is already long dead.TL;DR: So far so good."
-1	 it's an EA game (EARLY ACCESS) meaning there is a ton of work to be done to the game. Currently the game is great fun but I'm not recommending it on the basis of one thing ""HACKERS"" what I mean by that isn't real hackers as 99% of the morons don't have a clue what a Class Object even is let alone know how to really hack. Unfortunately the game has been out for less than a week and the hackers are in storm. I spent less than 1hr on the game and BAM instakilled."
1	 guess it's too late now. 7 days into early access and it's already more polished than a game stuck in EA for about 5 years..."
1	Awesome atmosphere and the perfect mix of PUBG and DayZ with a Forest-style crafting system!
-1	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THERE IS NOTHING TO DO AT ALL NO ANIMALS NO PEOPLE ONLY 2 PUPPETS IN THE 3 HRS I PLAYED. NO PROGRESSION. LITERALLY A BODY SIMULATOR WHICH IS ALSO BAD BECAUSE AFTER 15 MIN I AM STARVING AGAIN. ALSO NOT ONE TIP ON WHAT TO DO IN THE GAME. ALSO THERE IS NO END GAME AS OF NOW. ALSO FOR ABOUT AN HOUR I COULD NOT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THE SERVERS WOULD NOT LOAD
1	 will update soon"
-1	Fix memory leak pls
-1	 so that should give you a pretty good idea of how poorly this game is optimized.... 28fps on minimum settings and resolution...."
-1	 then ten seconds later I equiped a new backpack and my original backpack became stuck and unable to re equip and i lost all my good items.  Very dissapointing."
1	 so its worth the money."
-1	refunded. game is bad. stick to the other copies like h1z1 or dayz.
-1	Game is extremely broken. Not worth the $20 right now. Very empty but when you do come upon a person or animal combate is impossible. They will glitch out all over the place. Don't buy
1	 the devs made an excellent work and I expect nothing but greatness from this title. Big thanks to all the devs that made this game possible."
1	 I am excited to see how this game grows. 10/10"
1	Plays really well. Enjoying it very much except for the 2560x1080 resolution which cuts the map down when on full screen. The majority of D1-4 are missing and the bottom half of A1-4 are missing. Playing windowed 1707x1066 becasue of this. On a 34' LG ultra wide. Please help/fix
-1	 unlike this game"
-1	FPS. frame drops are unbearable. every time i fire a gun full auto in the airfield my game freezes entirely and i die due to it. It makes the game unplayable and the PvP aspect lacking alot. framesd need fixing first and formost before ill reconsider playing again.
1	 hope to see future updates."
1	*teleports behind you* NANI?!
-1	 game will die like the rest."
1	1. For a new game thats not done yet it is good it has not crashed on me not one time..2. The graphics is an A++ My PC play on 60fps with lags only sumtimes but not enough to effect the gameplay..3.Hand to Hand combat is really good and there is all kind of stuff to fight with but boxing with your freinds is really fun..4.The crafting on this game is nice to easy to use i cant wait for them to add more stuff to the game to make..5.The PVP on it is also nice and the ppl on this game isnt all bad like most games like this one..6.Its not hard to make a camp and soon there gonna add ways to make your own base..7.The road map for this game looks good makes it to where you cant wait for the next update stuff like car's boats planes NPC'S that fight eachother and u can pick sides that will make single player more fun to play and much more..8.keeping your player alive and moving takes more then just eating and drinking an thats makes the game fun to play..There is a lot more about the game i could talk about but that would take allday but its a good game and it is worth the money and prob. more.. SO IF UR LOOKING FOR A REASION TO GET IT JUST GO BUY IT ALREADY!!!
-1	 missing a lot of features. ( so far )"
1	 devs are super quick to mend any issues in the game."
1	 and im very excited to see where the developers go with this!"
1	 and it's not done yet."
1	This game has the potential to be best survival game to date 10/10 so far.
-1	Hard pass until netcode is fixed at the very least.
1	 everything works as intended and cant wait for more stuff's n thing's in the game!I give this game 8.5/10"
1	 but as an ea game which will constantly change it wouldn't make sense to optimize it"
-1	 but other areas were also terrible."
1	Best game ever!!....this is must buy if you love hardcore gaming
-1	The major flaws SCUM faces at the moment:1) 64 players is not enough for how massive the map is. 2) Spawns. You can't squad up with your mates before the game starts. You have to meet with one another once the game starts.3) Memory leak. The longer the match goes on the more your fps diminishes. You have to log back in every 30min to get good fps again.For $20 SCUM is insanely worth it once these three issues are fixed. The map is beautiful and the game is full of detail. Animations and physics are very good. The connection is impressively solid. I can see all the animations my mates are doing. The game feels in sync with other players and items dropped.
-1	not working cant connect to server
1	Very early review.So far runs pritty well. With this new ubdate they ubdated the server browser and improved loading speeds. If they keep it going its gonna be a good game.
1	 just dont play this game. If you're ready for some hardcore survival. i totally recommend it."
-1	 have to sit and wait for 30 seconds. Game frequently crashes with errors. Theres just nothing to this yet. They should have waited until base building and vehicles were done. Or the game even worked for that matter.At least ONE aspect of this should have been complete before releasing. Alpha alpha alpha..Not even.UPDATE: Just killed a guy with 924 rounds in his AK. He came back invisble and killed us through a wall. Have a screenshot of the weapon with the ammo. Great game!!!!......"
1	So far this game is awesome.  There are some minor qwerks like having to rebuild wooden spears and axes in offline play mode.  But it really doesn't matter...this game is 100% above my expectations. i can't wait to see how the final products looks.  Good Job!!!!
-1	 looks nice but its nothing that hasnt already been done"
1	 the cost goes up. So if you are into difficult games with an overwhelming sense of gratification then SCUM is great option. If you are looking for a new PUBG or Fortnite - Pass this up."
1	 just dont play this game. If you're ready for some hardcore survival. i totally recommend it."
1	So far this early access release is solid . Some strange bugs but until they fail to fix things in decent time frames my review is positive.
-1	 nor is there any real goal but to just loot and endlessly explore the map and just shoot people."
1	 the cost goes up. So if you are into difficult games with an overwhelming sense of gratification then SCUM is great option. If you are looking for a new PUBG or Fortnite - Pass this up."
1	 ha! 10/10"
1	 then cut off his head and made it into a hat. 10/10"
1	I can not see any servers when i refresh but so far its a good game
1	 and was killed while pooing. 10/10"
1	 respawn on sqad go back to pick up my stuff get shot in face by squad becouse i didnt say it`s me running there.  10/10  fun times :)"
1	Clean and Crisp survival/PVP game. Dayz meets ARK.
1	 the game will never be what you have built it up or imagined it to be. it's a toxic way of thinking. especially when the game is in it's Infancy as an Early Access title. it's a f'n game for chrissakes. have fun with it. and leave it at that."
1	Scum literally just came out and people are already giving crap reviews....  Give it a chance there are so many things that the devs could do to make the game better and guess what?  The Devs will make it better...  Remember they want this game to succeed as much(maybe even more) than we do.  Ive only played Scum for 47 minutes so far and I can see the potential.
1	i hate the little camera that finds you. other than that great survival game.
1	This game is so sick! proper real DEVs going hard at a game! u can feel the support! this game just getting bettter every day!
1	 active devs alsoAnd so far im having fun cant wait for more items and things to be added!"
1	The game definitely has potential with more content updates and if the devs dont let the game die it has the chances of being a great game. It is in early acces at the moment so when thinking of buying it dont go in with huge expectations and tinking it'll have lots of content. It can feel very bare bones at times on your own so I recommend finding someone to play with. All in all though I have enjoyed the game so far and im excited to see where the game will go with time.
-1	 but it's another case of releasing TOO early..."
1	camping air field simulator 11/10 would camp again
-1	 but it is just horrible at this state. Refund if you can..."
1	 AND PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CRAFT BANDAGES . THANKS FOR READING"
1	 hard learning curve. Its like a Harder DayZ. My PC Just can't handle it."
1	Lots of fun with very deep survival mecanics.

-1	 and even bugging so you maybe end losing you character after using time playing.    It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.  I did have a weight on 71kg .  after the bug. i weight a little over 130kg and i got a total new face (skin texture)The game have Big potential . I wont ask for refund. I still belive in the game.  But some Changed and fixed need to be made before i will use my time on it."
-1	 so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.Stay far away from this game until these issues have been adressed."
1	 Im just here to battle the bad reviews an hour into launch."
1	 the game needs some fixing but nothing major as far as Im concerned.Im playing with:i7700K OC to 4.8ghzGTX 980ti16gb of RAMI have everything set to the highest and I very rarely get lag. It pretty much runs smoothly at all times."
1	Has all it needs to be a Tripple A title. Mainly needs some work on the servers at the moment. But great potential when they add more stuff. 7/10 at release date. Not bad tho. Active devs. Keep it up.
