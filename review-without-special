label	review
1	Loving this game so far! Hopefully man more hours to come.
-1	Hate DayZ? SAME.
1	This Game is Sooo GOOD. It the 1st of its kind that ive played and im loving it.. The Game stole my whole day and night. time flew. its going to be the best of its kind.....
1	 the developer just need to ramp up their game now they have a lot of fans.Don't leave us hanging like DayZ standalone."
1	 but still a great game overall"
1	Love the game. The Devs are amazing.
1	Pretty fun game. Good launch. Yes there aren't an incredible amount of features in the game but then again it's early access. If the devs keep this up it'll be the DayZ we all wanted. But better.
-1	I love going to high loot areas to try and get geared and get killed by lazerbeaming indestructible robots. it is very very FuN!   :(
1	 opened door and instantly get shot by the mech.10/10"
1	Very basic server settings !Hey Devs Just wondering how long till us server owners will have more than 5 settings to change. We could use 1.day/night time ajustments cause nights are to long (people are complaining) 2. Weather on / off option3. Ability to make some slots reserved for admins and mods and others open to public on same server. 4. More customized loot percentage option to adjust ( because scopes and food is really low on spawning.5. The ability to use our own custom screen for server loading ( Almost all server host offer this) Gportal has said that yous have to open the options for them to offer to us owners. Other than that the game is amazing having a blast. Thanks
1	 and know what your expectations should be and you will enjoy your $20."
1	 glitches and performance issues are present and that's expected when buying a game during it's development stage. People whining about it should shut up and ducks EA's and Ubisoft's deeek."
1	"""PRINTEDCHEATS.CO.UK""   he is teleporting around the map and killing people someone please ban this dude"
-1	 high end pc are required"
1	 Experince is your best weapon!"
1	gud
-1	 but at the same time I've fought zombies only to end the fight with the building around me disappearing and then re-spawning.It's a buggy mess. Products in this state shouldn't be allowed for purchase."
1	 just like any EA game.- UI feels outdated.Honestly that's all I can think of. I've spent 17.4 hours in the game at the time of this review and it's been out for two days. I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take the game!"
1	TL:DR- Great game. Community is both the most friendly and most toxic I have ever seen. Cheating is still a problem but not an overwhelming. Just remember its still in alpha and still has a plethera of bugs. You are paying to participate in the alpha and this game has a lot of potential; So much so I bet it will be more than $19.99 when it hits 1.0. Totally worth it imo. Can get stale without friends.
-1	the fact that you cant go get your loot after you die makes this game so dumb im almost done playing it its so annoying to have to restart because of a robot shooting you through a wall and killing you in 1 shot when you have full military gear
1	A lot of people are complainng about this game but they don't understand that it's EARLY ACCESS. For an early access game this is a fantastic game! Very detailed and fun to play.  I haven't played this game with friends yet but i'm sure when I do it will be a blast. There's a small bug here and there but that part of it in this stage of the game. This is way better than I expected it to be.
1	 and devs are super on top of things!"
1	I fought to the death with a Russian throwing us lettuces. 10/10
1	 but all you have to do is run backwards while they are chasing you and attack immediately after they take a swing; that's your opening! Rinse and repeat. The best feature is it has a single player mode. I've been just exploring without having to become paranoid about someone following me and killing me. Take in the breeze and sights!"
1	 but come on it just came out give it some time. Its what I wanted for a long time."
-1	 other than that just another early access promising too much."
-1	it not funny
-1	at this stage with no base building and no vehicles and no npcs to fight its just get stuff you dont need to shoot people with no goal in mind theres like 5 guns and 2 can have sights 3 are iron sights only so as of now they put the game out that becomes stale quik because of lack of content esp for the amount of time they have had to hype it up so for me scum is boring oh and the bear helmet looks like a mascot head not like the one in the video .....oh yeah and no disease or sickness amd a very big unexplained learning curve for nutrition that doesnt make any difference when it comes to the only goal which is shoot anyone. Get it together scum
1	ADD EXTRA THINGS IN GAME AND MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND BULLETS AND FOOD
1	Super fun game. But its still kinda buggy since its still early access but atleast the devs are doing updates often.
-1	 altho..... once the patch came out my game keeps crashing every 10 minutes or so. At this point I would wait a while before buying the game."
1	i really do enjoy this game its so much fun with freinds its better than dayz
1	 must grow more with people support it have great future lets hope dont end like day z..."
1	 only played single player so far and it gets pretty fun when you get decent weapons and are laying out lines of dead walkers."
1	good
-1	game bad
1	Ok game. Going to play it again next year.
1	its the best in its genre.also give croteam money.
-1	Ran around and killed an angry russian man 2/10
1	It ight
-1	Bad optimization and extremely boring and lackluster. Good concept and pretty decent graphics especially the blood. Combat is quite bad. I hit a guy with a shovel and stabbed him with a knife about 30 times and he one hits me with a stick to the face and he laughed so pretty 10/10 combat very fair.
1	After only playing for a few hours i can say this game is very fun and has a lot of potentia. The only downside is that im getting FPS spikes and low fps in some areas but this game is new so this should hopefully be fixed soon.
-1	 wait for the patch note that fixes this i'm on a 1080ti & 6700k btw..."
1	buy now it good game yesssssssssssssssssssss
1	 and I think i could have some real fun playing with friends. I think the future is bright for SCUM and I can't wait to see whats in store.***ATTENTION 21:9 USERS THE GAME IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED FOR 21:9 BUT THEY SAY THEY WILL SOON FIX THAT***"
-1	Fights are basicly ice skiing around with heavy de-sync also after dying your hunger remains so next life you remain starving. I love the depth of the systems but this game is not early access ready.
-1	 im not going to do that in a game.REFUND/10"
1	 as it is currently I recommend to buy. The only problem is that the servers have been overloaded today but recently they threw out a patch and I dont have any problems now.Ignore the negative reviews they are there mostly because of server issues"
1	Scum is a great game. The game works well and feels great for being as early in development as it is. People need to remember that it's early access and literally just came out. There will be issues. There will be bugs. And on top of all that it's only $20.
-1	 its a great idea."
1	 I love this game! Excited to see the future updates."
1	 once the desync issues are sorted this will be a 10/10 game."
1	so far ive played about 10-20 minutes and its ok from playing single-player and its pretty good but most of the times ive tryed to join a server it says failed to join thats my only gripe play it try it like it or not you can always return it
1	 open to all! looking foward for this awesome game"
1	 the heart is there.I can see myself enjoying this game alot in the future."
1	Online teleport simulatorWilling to teleport again!
-1	 but running around the woods to find a new hoodie isn't what i'm looking for"
1	 and you use it you aren't going to magically increase in blood at an exponentially fast rate. Its suppost to be realistic and immersive and in scum your blood regens 1000% faster than in real life yet lesser players still complain.This game wouldn't have mixed reviews if people understood what ""early access"" entails and did 2 minutes of research before spending 20$ on a game."
1	 great potential. There are bugs and problems being an EA but nothing crippling and the dev's seem very focused and are listening to community."
1	Awesome game!
-1	 except instead of a marathon runner youre a 45 yr old out of shape fat person who gets tired every 100 yards of jogging.  And want even more fun? play it online where you spend 4 hrs collecting loot and running across the map to get shot 1 time by another random player and then you get to start it all over again running from the other corner of the map."
-1	 and scarce amounts of information online from what I can tell. Frustrating experience overall but I'm optimistic that the developers can continue fixing this game."
-1	 needs more action and less crafting."
1	Dayz but good.
-1	 but once you get it you're going to lose it to performance related issues and it's incredibly frustrating to lose it because of server/network issues after you spent 2 hrs + running around."
-1	The laggiest early access game I've ever played
1	Very nice and fun survival game. Netcode needs fixing but otherwise game runs pretty well.
1	 but still a lot of fun."
1	 there's nothing we can do much in the game instead of learning new other stuff Need more optimization + Game FeaturesMaybe Add Some Vehicle + Or Maybe Base ? ( so we can store our items)"
-1	 But 90% of the time this game manages to screw up somehow."
1	LOVE THE GAME!! I would recomend the team to make more stuff to build. maybe a bigger shelter or even like your own house. I have got 3 of my friends to buy the game!
1	 and then some.Do not enter this game expecting a feature complete Rust or EFT killer complete with the nuances that make those games independently great. Try SCUM if you're a salt dog Day Z vet who wants to scratch the itch while also battling your characters insatiable need to pee before every gunfight."
1	 liking it a lot."
1	This game is the next pubg and forenight. Nice size map great first and third person views  Landscape looks great
1	  no joke. It is. Please.10 Yes on this review and I kill myself on stream."
1	 if your not into survival sims and expecting BR or heavily PVP focused game then your not going to enjoy. It's a shame a lot of the streamers who got early access weren't the type of streamers that play these types of games regularly as set some false expectations in my personal opinion anyway"
-1	thank you"
1	Wow absolutely one of the best games on steam. Love it.
1	 weapons and vehicles... but it's totally worth $20!"
1	 especially in Early Access. Make sure you know what you're getting."
1	just started but this is ***** / *****
1	.
1	- Looted for 3 hours. - 2 people approached me and told me they are frienldy. - They told me i can take a dump and they will protect me. - I trusted them. - As soon as i started to take a dump they killed me and stole all my items.   10/10 would trust again.
1	Early days of the game but I think give it time and this could be up there with some of the best if the devs listen to the community.
-1	 but there's no way for me to set it up that way right now.  I just can't understand how (again yes it's early access but still) you could release an FPS game and not allow hold vs toggle options in settings.If it ever changes so we can use hold for ADS I'll probably update this review."
1	Best No items found simulator
1	 died and raged."
-1	 but these are things that should have been fixed before beta release"
1	Really good and fun game
1	Map is too large and encounters are very rare. Even playing full pop servers you'll rarely run into anyone. There's no modes of transportation either which really makes traveling super bording considering the fact it takes an hour to run from one side of the map to the other.1) No Vehicles2) No base/build system3) Crafting is annoying4) Game lags when loading new chunks5) There's no admin system so hosting your own server will be fun considering you can't kick or ban anyone (from your own server)
-1	 rest of the game is trash."
-1	 crafting and the complicated metabolism stuff seem like fun but I guess that is a skill most big streamers have hype as to be honest it is all pretty crappy. The complicated parts are just stupidly complicated for no reason. There's no loot anyway. It's badly optimized. Also the graphics may be sharp but there is no atmosphere etc. If you want a good OWS then go for Miscreated or The Forest or something."
1	 i say this game will be a big hit!"
1	10/10 dayZ + rust. watch out for them mechs mechaS
1	This is the game DayZ was supposed to be all those years ago.Loving it!
1	already the best survival game
-1	 we laughed at each other as we tried to hit eachother while lagging so hard we flashed around like teleporting wakamoles. joke"
1	my friend ate sea salt bc she was hungry and her sodium levels reached 700%
1	 it's in early access for a reason."
1	 50 to 60 fps with 1080 at max settings. No server issues so far. Dont see all the issues everyone else is having."
1	 just trying to even the reviews against people who are complaining about ghetty things that don't have anything to do with the game itself"
1	Finally a game where I can poop on the people I kill. 10/10. Teabagging will never feel the same again.
1	 I havent experienced a lot of the content yet so I may edit :) definitely recommend as I am excited to see what the devs bring in future updates"
1	First of all can we see our last dead location plus the items on the ground?The game is great but killing only 1 zombie is so hard. Please focus on PVE.. Its an amazing game. We need coop for singleplayer for sure! Also can we have more loot ? Can we have random coop with people in single player. This will be amazing. Also can we have autorun so that we dont need to Press W for a lot of time? Can we have some settlements to do quests and maybe even have a npc companion. This game is the ultimate game and need to be TRIPLE A !  Please improve this game like hell. I will support it! This game does not need any RPG elements it already has ! It just needs more NPC's and settlements etc. Think about having a story or something! Think about having bases and gather gear their etc. Please please please please focus on Single Player! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this game is amazing ! Make it coop let it have bases quests and stuff. Make bandits and etc! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE If this game is like that and its like 1000 dollars i would pay 3000 just because its legendary!There is no singleplayer survive game like this! Please make it coop with random people some people dont have friends to play with:):)  Can we have markers when we see a loot close by! Also can we have a guide or something please:)Thanks for the developers for creating a such a good game ! They just gave us a legendary game! Thanks a lot for the good work! With all my heart i hope single player gets more depth and nice touches! I am praying!
1	 but needs more content"
1	 you are going to get yourself drowned if you try to swim fully geared. Heavy rain also tends to slow your movement if you go on without a raincoat and get soaked.And for me i just enjoy it when i can urinate and poop on the dead bodies of my enemies9/10 and will be 10/10 after the FPS issues have been fixed! :)Cheers~!"
-1	 save your money."
1	 and I believe it will raise it even higher. I am in this for the long haul. And I am happy to be. :)"
1	 all that details in survival part of the game give an extra touch. for ea once logged in server i had no glitches in the game..and that a plus from me"
-1	 then die and start over"
-1	 but only if you're new to this type of game"
1	Open world realistic survial! if you like this style game put this one on your wish list!
-1	 never died to zombies or robots. Met some young friends peed and pooped a couple of times. Lag fest when you're near other players. In the state this game is in I refunded. 3/10"
-1	poo
1	Has great future if the devs keep it up!! 7/10
-1	Runs Horribly.Willing to give a good review if the performance gets better.
-1	its okay...
1	 I think this game has promise if they fix the issues its currently riddeled with.For 20 bucks i'd say its worth it."
-1	 but do not exceed the two hour refund limit while playtesting."
1	 but infiltrating military bases and PvP (when not laggy) are *SUPER* fun"
-1	 players on officials servers are trreating it like a BR more than a Survival game.And now we got ""moderators"" deleting post and silencing players both on Steam and Discord(banning them) for voicing problems.its just kinda BAD ALL AROUND"
-1	 i'm not recommending playing this game."
1	 and more to the game.Pros:Frequent updatesIncredible graphicsDevelopers listenUnique storylineComplex skill customizationCons:No vehicles (yet)"
-1	not intrested
-1	 you can kill zombies but what's the fun in that i can do that in any other game and have fun doing it. honestly if you are going to make an abitious game like this and you want to showcase what the game offers don't throw out a halfbaked idea that leaves your player base with nothing to do. yes realise it is early access but that is no excuse for charging people to play it with no real meat to offer. If i had to compare this game to something i would compare it to agar.io get points become powerful until you die then start over. i.e not fun"
1	shot 5 shells at a puppet had to kill it with spears instead 11/10
1	 and the long distance water graphical glitches (bright flashes and flickering).  Up close the water reflections look utterly mesmerizing but farther away than 15 meters they dissapear and are replaced by empty flashing.  This is really the only significant problem for me with the game right now.  Once this is fixed the visuals in this game will be flawless and stunning.  FInal Thoughts: Breath of fresh air.  Have not been this excited about a game in quite a while.  Takes the open world survival multiplayerish genre to a whole other level.  Gameplay feels polished.  Once the graphical glitches are fixed (possibly an amd thing?) and performance issues are fixed this will be one of the best games on steam.  Absolutely stunning visuals. Support these developers so they can fix stuff and add content."
-1	 it is not yet alpha. We will se what it becomes."
1	 SCUM will become the best open world survival game."
1	this game needs a few things first base building i suggest like rust its easy and fun second more crafting like  camo with leafs and more and different weapons overall i love it but please take the advice of your players
1	Promising
-1	 or find some that you trust and that isn't full."
1	What an amazing game. Can't wait for better FPS!!!!!!
1	 a promising start. I recommend it to people who are fans of survival fps but would hold back until the game's a little fleshed out (for people who don't like long stretches of walking simulator)."
-1	 would not reccomend."
1	grapchis etc."
1	 for now save your money and get some MCDonalds."
-1	 why you need to get points too?) because it denies many possible Roleplay situation because people just wanna get the points for killing. I REALLY hope the devs are gonna listen to the community and make this game great. Will check out again in a few weeks and edit this if I don't forget it."
1	 just annoying"
-1	Why is this game such a trash?
1	Add to cart
1	 did I mention how beautiful the game looks?Devs please sort out ultra wide and allow us lockable loot crates to store our stuff."
-1	 very far from a game. No idea behind the gameplay yet. Just another DayZ rip-off with some additional character parameters."
-1	 if it ever comes out of early access I'll gladly pay full price but until then there are just too many other optons on Steam."
1	Good
1	 I think it will succeed for a good amount of time as long as the developers do what THEY want with a small hint of player knowledge."
1	Connection lost!
1	 the  biggest being HACKERS. and SERVER DESYNC and MEMORY LEAK. Theres so much in store and im excited for the future of it as long as these problems get fixed within a realistic time frame.Once the anticheat gets put in place and they can stabilize the servers this game will reign supreme."
1	Very Good Game Like Rust+pubg thats the prosCons is No asia or SEA SErver yet.I Recommend it.
1	Fun and surprisingly stable
-1	Basically DayZ with more bells and whistles.Running SimulatorWait for some updates.
-1	 now let's actually see some hard work to actually prove that it can be reached."
1	 Intel Core i7-6700k CPU @ 4.00 ghz with 16gb Ram and it runs quite nicely on medium and still looks great enough. High was pushing my frames.It's slower paced and action could be few and far between but I don't mind. You need the slow moments to appreciate the action and gather gear. I was near starvation until I ate that guy.Only con : Servers could use a bit more polish. Restarting every 10-15 minutes but it's the first day so we'll see."
1	 hippie pants and a beanie.- Day/Night and Weather Cycle.- Abundant levels of flora and fauna.- For an early access game quite a lot of crafting to be done.- Find a school backpack and become GOD.- Vault over fences and through windows.- That feeling you get when you know you have found your next favourite game :D- I can poop and pee and vomit.- You can have 'dry' poops or squirty diarroea poops.POOP/10              BEST GAME EVER"
-1	 if not then wait or upgrade."
1	Needs more hardcore elements.At the moment its a too arcadey...But its an ok game i guess
1	 but that doesn't take a lot to do."
1	its an early access game. itll have its quirks. overall this game has plenty of potential and its worth dealing with a few bugs on launch day. i would 100% reccommend getting this game
1	Fun fact: this game was named after the french
1	 but the devs are great and fixed launch issues within 2 hours. Game mechanics and what not are amazing it is what dayz wanted to be but better."
1	Fun.
1	Been following the development of SCUM for over a year and I'm not biased but I also do/did have some very high expectations. Can truly say at launch this is the most polished early access game I have ever played and almost all I play is early access games. The devs have came through on every promise they've made so far and the game looks and runs beautifully for me. 60 FPS on Epic settings on a 1060. For $20 you won't get a better game anywhere. Haven't personally ran into any bugs yet in 15 hours of gameplay and no hackers whatsoever thus far and all the features work fluidly. One warning though is SCUM has an incredibly intricate and realistic metabolism system that can be very overwhelming if you aren't into that kind of thing. Everything you put into your body matters and everything you do has an affect on yourself so be warned this isn't a walk in the park survival game but I digress.Buy SCUM and you will never regret it.
1	 has potential."
-1	While the game is not terrible its just not very good. I was trying to find some good things to say about the game in this review and could not name any. There are plenty of cons though is why I say stay far away from this game for right now.
-1	 but it adds nothing but an anoyance to the gameplay.if you wanna buy a game and are trying to figure out between DAYZ and this... buy this... if you have DAYZ.. dont buy this"
-1	Game is very unoptimised when to the point of it being imposible to play with all the fps drops when you approach a place with many buildings.
1	Killed a guy and then ate him! Raw!!!! This game will be one of the greats.
1	 solid and promising early access game."
1	 do something!"
1	Not to bad of a game once you get use to the game mechanics. Made my guy poop and a choco bar came out. So of course I ate it lol.
-1	 but I'm not struggline that bad and am a total newb at these types of games.First guy I met in the game killed me with a spear from behing. The next I met was a couple people in a city and they were all really friendly and helpful.This game is TOTALLY WORTH the 20 bucks it costs right now."
1	How do I dab in this game?
1	 and teleporting/laggy servers. for $20 its a must buy. You will get your moneys worth."
1	Off to a really good start. Lot of fun.
-1	 not worth the money."
1	pretty good early access
-1	Refunded
-1	Its day Z... :(
1	 Holds up well graphicly."
1	This game is everything DayZ was supposed to be. 10/10.
-1	if you dont like searching for a gun for over an hour this game is not for you
-1	 has promise though"
-1	 but if you want that go play Dayz."
1	 but I would rather get back to playing it then wasting breath."
1	Great! :D works very nice for an alpha!
1	 you won't regret it."
1	 to those of you who ARE man enough; I'll see you out there but not for long."
1	 there are many planned features and fixes on the way.See you. ^^"
1	i hope this game keeps on updating not like thee other games (dayz!!!)
1	Great Game the only thing I would love to see is them make it so you can use a pc controller like xbox one or any pc controller so its easier to use the game rather  then the keyboard and mouse
1	Amazing game. Devs talk to players and listen to our opinions. Even on Early Access it runs amazingly good (contrary to other games).
1	 but it's still there.That's it. Get this game."
-1	 it's just more of a social game and if you don't have people to play with it's not worth the time and the money."
1	 wait for it to jump in price. Or wait for more content to come."
-1	 I don't need anticheat if I'm playing solo isn't it?I tried to change resolution to fullhd - ""game crushed... DX11..."""
-1	"" but the fact that it's this bad right now leaves me with little hope that it will ever feel like a fully-released game."
-1	it will be die like dayz
1	My friend told me i could throw melee weapons. I spent 3 chasing a deer that just so happened to have my axe stuck in it. 8/10.
-1	 the game is so realistic!) Then you're good to go to the Airport and PvP or simply wait around at your camp until another player shoots you."
-1	 it is not for co-op"
-1	Not closed to finished. Will buy again once the game gets more content fleshed out of it.Will recommend if the game follows through down its later path of development
1	 if you're going solo prepare for the good old KOS that comes with all survival games. I really hope they can add Random events that happen around the map that involes PvE fighting and rewards with good loot."
1	 this baby's a DayZ killer."
1	Cant wait to see what come in the future
1	Dayz is definitely dead now
1	 I really enjoy playing it even in it's current state. highly reccomend for any fans of the hardcore survival genre!!!!!"
1	 this is a good investment."
1	 hoping combat is improved further its not terrible now"
-1	 or even ligma buy this game.. it gave me terminal cancer"
-1	 repeat. no objective or anything. Refunded. Just bought it again f  uck it dude"
1	AWESOME GAME!!!!  Big like for everything :D :D :D
-1	this game trash. the geme is trash. save som money and dont buy it
-1	I was going to refund this game but I got so bored I fell asleep for 3 hours now I can't refund it. 2/5
1	10\10 LOVE this game worth every penny
1	 peace!"
-1	This is not Dayz and never will be. Its a terrible rip off. Game is trash. Find anything else.
1	 good community. Everything DayZ needed to be. When this game hits 1.0 it's probably going to be the best survival game ever!"
1	Games has potential. If you can't deal with early access bugs right now; wait. I've enjoyed it for now and hope the devs can handle the hackers and desync.
1	+This game is good.-Finding teammates is hard when they keep dying.-they need to add a party system.-It shouldnt cost 100 fame points to respawn on an ally.-Needs optimisation.+Fun.+interesting.Get this game if you dont suck at surviving.
1	My experiences:>Spawns in a village>Sees AFK guy with good loot>Kills him>Pees on him>Poos on him>Vommits on him>Dies by his team mate>Cries10/10 would play again
1	How do i get a squadmate
-1	This single handedly the worse gmae I've ever played. Does not feel finished and lacks a lot of key components.
-1	 hackers and broken mechanics.however there is a enjoyable experience burried beneath all this crap.i will give the game a recommendation if they fix all of that"
-1	 the game looks good and it is a cool world."
1	 but overhaul for its early access status its pretty good. Can/t wait to see the futur update."
1	 work at it and stay true to what it is. A survival game.]"
1	 and will be more so if they deliver what they say they willl. Game has potential to be one of the all-time greats."
-1	 hard to figure out what the hell is going on and what we should be doing in-game. No guidance whatsoever. Got some laughs out of how badly it ran on my PC. I felt that streamers were not fully transparent or lacked knowledge on how poorly this will run on a PC that costs under 1k."
1	 annnnnd finally the graphics are outstanding when your walking out in the woods with the settings on max (without motion blur). Id give it a heft 7.5/10 for its current state."
1	I take better care of my ingame character than myself.
1	Needs work still fun
-1	I wouldn't recommend this just yet... Maybe in few months  as the game improves overall..    its hard to play  and don't really know why I'm playing it... the game  doesn't gtive you purpose... you just waste time going around looting items to get killed stupidly
1	 and then ate his leg so that he lives on through me."
1	 even though the trailer kinda suggests its. Reminds me of the first few months of DayZ on ARMA2 but with better features. Really scratches that nostalgia itch."
1	Here is the DayZ without dumbed down that we all have been waiting for!
-1	A slighty better version of DAYZ. Great concept and as of right now thats all it is a concept. No real goal hinder it. Robots and loot site make it three times harder to get loot.
-1	 and you shouldn't either."
1	 nobody saw such a huge group of people buying this game."
1	 so good. Having a lot of fun playing this with a buddy. The crafting/some aspects of character management are a little overwhelming at first but once you get used to the UI it's easy to manage. Lots of looting and have had some good stealth and PVP moments. Already getting the DAY Z style random encounters / PVP. RIP DAY Z. Press [F] to pay respects."
1	Day Z and batleground is dead :) 16.99 price is too cheap this game now worths like 40 eur :)"
-1	Runs like crap on RX 470. Would not recommend if you have less then 1070/vega 56
1	 just fix the desync because pvp is a mess."
1	Peed with two other people in a triangle 11/10 would pee again.... p.s. they killed me later and ate my corpse
1	SCUM is an extremely promising survival game. I'm really impressed with how the devs are handling the game so far.
1	10/10
1	I bought this game when it came out. And been having lots of fun with friends already. Great metabolism system. Really looking forward to when the systems are fully developed. The game is also only 17.49 USD. So there isnt much too loose. A really cool survival game kinda like DayZ. I can easily recommend this game. But keep in mind it is currently early acess! :)
-1	 I was not expecting to pay another $20 just to rent a server with 20 people. Quite disappointing."
1	GAME OF THE YEAR
1	 but IT'S EARLY ACCESS so everyone crying about that stuff needs to stop. They are releasing updates and fixing things! Bottom line it's worth $20. (:"
-1	 i wish i didnt buy it"
1	Better than DayZ by alot 10/10
-1	Day 1 : couldnt play on any OF servers bc they were down (whatever thats cool ill mess around in solo player and play tomorrow.) Day 2: still down for all day so i come back to it at night. Log in to an official server and after 2 mins in game get killed by a hacker 6 times in a row all random spawns all right after spawning..... is there really no anticheat? I can't believe game developers have not learned yet. 2 GOLDEN RULES FOR EARLY ACCESS: 1. Your players will do everything you dont think they will be able to do faster than you dont think they will be able to do it. 2. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HACK YOUR GAME. HAVE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM IN PLACE TO STOP IT AND REPORT IT.I can't test your game if I can't play your game.
-1	Game full of hackers.
-1	 definately do not recommend at all."
1	 all in all I'd give this game a try. TBH I'd pay for this game even if it was more like $25 or even $30 the way it is right now."
-1	 i especially loved the tattoo designs as it simulated that of what prisoners would have. When i came on today to play i was thoroughly disappointed to find out you have removed nazi tattoos as this was my favourite part of the game. It would mean a lot to me and my ancestors if you would please put them back in the game. Thank you."
-1	 boom. He killed me 10 seconds later. Great. Lost everything. Second game- I finally started to get the hang of it and enjoyed it more but then was head shot by a random hacker and lost everything. The game lags so badly that it's had to even (not that I even had a gun) shoot at a player because players and animals lag around. If I was given this game for free I wouldn't even play it at the state it's in. Luckily I was able to get my refund because this game advertises ""Coop"" Multiplayer when in fact it is clearly not."
-1	Not what I expected. Was looking for a game to replace Just Survive. Its not the same. Kind of makes me sad. The hype for this game was through the roof. Maybe after game imprtoves and building is added ill give it a try again but I am rewuesting a refund til then.
1	 thank you.[Week 2]After play this game i think system anti-peek is not ok. Becuase all character is warp.You should remove this system or split servers 2 type 1.FPP 2.TPPI love this game.TITAN"
1	 an i7 and 64 Gigs of ram I was only getting 3 frame. unplayable. It looks like a great game but you need a beast RIG to play it."
1	 and well just amazing game.Great job devs!  cant believe you are still calling this game an early realese."
1	 trip alarm"
1	Optimizations are better than PUBG Early Access and This game is vey advanced !Hardcore Features in this game is stunning and Unique !Superb Graphics and Nice Gameplay !This Game is the Best Game Compared To Other Survival Games and Must Be The Turning Point Of Survival Game Genre !
1	 I'd still buy again 10/10"
1	Nice game.
1	Best Early Access Game
1	Great Pee&Poop Simulator!   10/10
1	 specialy when you'r engaging hostile players and ur friend has explosive diharea. Maybe because he ate to much human flesh but who knows could be the cocumbers."
-1	 it will be a great game some day. But that's an uninstall for me."
-1	 I can't host my own server and renting server cost $1.04 per slot- There is nothing to do in this game beside running for 15 minutes just to see your friends every time you die- You either will see a player that says ""friendly friendly"" or a player that kills you when you turn your back away"
1	 this is not for you."
1	 and the developers are very involved.10/10"
1	 and already beats most of other survival games :D"
1	Awesome game but really needs official SEA server :)
1	 when ever i try to kook in my invantory i get the taunt menu. i also do not like to HAVE to use brake fluid to start a fire. if you try to place a pistal and a bayonet next to each other it does not work. i recomend a helicopter for one of the vehicles in the future. and thanks for a great game!"
-1	 you getting into the worst experience of your life."
1	 except on day two of release there is already hackers speed running around one shotting you through the ground. that is the developers biggest hurdle now."
1	 and is plenty of fun already."
1	great game
1	 Ive got some 20+ hours and there's many more to come.P.S I saw another review stating that he hardly ever finds anyone.. Our squad has had several firefights against other players over the past few days."
1	 calls out to various kind of gamers.Now I know it's still in early access but the memory leak is SEVERE!!Start the game at 144fps and after 10 minutes you're down to 40/50!Better restart your game before getting into any fight scenarios!!Overall it has potential!!"
1	 just casual spikes here and there"
1	 making mechs slower/turn slower would have been a better nerf in my opinion.all in all i think $20 is a fair price for this survival EA game as it's great if you like running around looting with the occasional player interaction and the option to play some event gamemodes (although respawns need improving)soz grammar nazis I cbf checking this."
-1	Brought Game... played... i mean ran around doing nothing for 1.5 hours... Went and got Refund... not worth buying at this stage
1	 WTFFF?"
1	I am new to pc gaming (lifelong console gamer) and have only played for a little while on single player. I really enjoy the survival and crafting elements. Due to having an old computer this game is hard to run and lags quite a bit so until that gets fixed with a new computer and game patches I will have to wait to play multiplayer.
1	 etc. however the player base just seems kinda laggy. I get it. game just came out. but still its a bit strange to see such ""lag"" i guess i could say in other players.There are some other things wrong with the game but a lot of rights. For a game that just came out I really do think it's headed in the right path. I just hope that the devs can really take into consideration the food issue and maybe a friend system. Other than that I really do love the game and what it has to offer."
1	 just get it. side note: the concurrent player count is growing like crazy."
-1	No bueno.
-1	ITS CRAP
-1	 and skill."
1	Very nice early acces game. Off course its not polished and NO its not the next gen CoD. Its a survival game with pvp elements. I cant judge if you will like the game but I do.8/10
1	gud
1	fun so far. needs to be optimized badly. it runs pretty rough
1	 and hardworking. Definately a promising game. Given its current price at only 20$ USD I would say you're missing out if you dont give it a try."
1	You should definitely get this game. It's already good and it will continute to get better because the dev team is very responsive and listens to the community. They have already released 2 patches almost right after its release and there is another patch on the way.
1	 and gunfights with smoke and explosions on 1920x1080. Encountered no serious bugs so far"
1	80+ hours and still not bored yet!!  I hope people can just see past these REEE comments and have fun with what is here because this game for an initial showcase of what it is has really impressed me. Week 1 and I don't think there dev team have even slept yet the patches / fixes keep pouring in. there all over the steam forums taking on board what the community is saying / reporting and there acting on it almost hourly its crazy. I have not seen one negative remark from them either really good team and a legendary product. Seriously get this game stay open minded its an alpha get past the initial learning curve and get in there and see what you are made of. Well worth the the price tag support these devs this game has so much to offer and so far its delivering every day.
-1	good game still needs a lot of work still good to play solo or in team would be even better if you could build a base or at lest fortify houses so for now i give it 2 out of 5 stars
-1	 wait till it actually works."
1	Better than DayZ.
1	 PUBG.Storyline - Doesnt exist really . Your scum in a massive prison and you have to survive thats it.Depth - Not huge it is trying to be to many games. I think it wants to be PUBG for adults.Crafting - minimal basically what you carry and a dodgy little campsiteAt $20 its worth getting and it still has some alpha issues like focus points disappearing in single player.Be aware it has an insane in depth health system that you need a degree or phd to understand in short cokked is best many ingrediants also the best."
1	please make playable on mac
-1	 but it will most likely be too little too late."
-1	This game is trash - Save yourself $20.
-1	 yet. Enough releasing unfinished games."
1	SCUM is like dayz...no wait Battlegrounds.....no more like metal gear solid 5.......maybe like arma exiles......no just no its not like anything everything is like SCUM even tho its early access its still the best one downloadable ATMSO MUCH POTENTIAL AND STILL GREAT. GET IT!!!!!     20$????? cant beat it. get the supporter pack too the mystery item helps!!!
1	Good game just needs some optimizing
1	 repeat. Game is getting patches everyday so it seems promising."
1	Good Game.
1	"Great EA game.  It is in Alpha phase but it is already light years ahead of other games out there that claim to be in ""Beta.""  They still have a long way to go but the Dev team is killing it with the updates and stuff right now."
-1	 and im still let down."
1	 well worth the $20."
1	"
1	 calibrate scope. Adjust for wind.... barometric PRESSURE? Really? Yes. lol Come and see!"
1	buy it 100% worth it
1	I see great potential
1	 its a lot of fun."
1	 rust is a small sanbox map where people build bases and raid others this is not like that. i would say its worth the $20 escpially as the updates keep coming out"
1	 and I am very excited to see where it will take us in the future."
1	Zombies.......CHECKCrafting........CHECKPVP/PVE.......CHECKLarge Open World.......CHECKIf you are looking for a DayZ/Just Survive/Exile Mod game I think this is the one.
1	 and the combat is poor. for around every 4-5 zombie hits you might get a punch in. overall im looking forward to seeing updates and continuing play."
1	"waited so long for this so i'm ok with any issues1st day join a discord scum group.20 of us on fresh server.setup base after all being noobs and finally getting a fire goingTag teaming zombies and running around waiving their dead dead body partsMan shows up dressed as a Bear he skinned (MR.BADDASS)I pooped out a banana from my ""prison pocket"" (this perk is in the paid DLC plus other things)A team mate peed on a deerJump into event mode 5 minute fun in PVP land ( Had to lower GFX settings for FPS)Beautiful to look at even on a ancient R290 Gfx card8.5 / 10 worth $20 (+$8 for the DLC)Thank you devs"
1	ayeeeeeeeee
1	 game has potential."
1	 there is a ton to do and explore. The dev's have a clear vision for the game and it looks like its gonna be one fun ride to the end."
1	 you can count on good developer community feedback and timely updates."
1	 they just really have to work on optimization :("
1	 i like the sound in this game it is so real.Please put in this game that i can be girl.!!"
-1	play for an hour best thing i find is a pitchfork
1	 already theres hackers and no way to report DayZ 2.0."
1	Better than Dayz
1	 then buy this game and buckle up. If you dont like Dayz you probably wont like this."
-1	Game is worse than league
1	Got good potential.
1	 but I expect this with early-access and the response from the devs far surpasses anything I've seen for such a popular game.These devs deserve some recognition for putting this game together and I hope it becomes one of the most popular survival games around."
-1	  everyone wil go right after you as soon you are spotted like its a counterstrike game.DONT BUY THIS GAME! UR LIFE IS WURTH WAY MORE"
1	 this game will simply be incredible. for $20 its an absolute steal !!"
1	 but the game has potential"
1	good
1	 except for haxors."
1	(y)
1	 literally!! 11/10"
1	 considering the fact that you have to find the right foods and cook it to maintain a good body and health."
-1	 just keeps crashing."
-1	Best running simulator on steam 10/10
1	 I QUIT THE GAME MY HEADSET WORKS AGAIN."
-1	exclude cheater
1	 and it shouldn't for you either. I think this game is pretty dope for what it is in its current form. Especially for only 20 bucks. Buy this game and support the devs. They got some cool stuff coming."
-1	 base building and readily available food/water"
-1	 dont waste $20."
1	Solid Game
1	 the game was just released and has plenty of time to add and modify what the community sees fit."
1	 for an early access game i give it an B-. Reason i gave B- because theres not many guidelines just yet for the game"
1	 much better than other titles in this stage of development and the graphics are very appealing. Lots of fun with friends. I recommend this to anyone! Support the developers and they will make this game like all survivals should be. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1	 finding them can be a challenge as you all spawn on different parts of the map. If you spawn a long way from your friend you will play a fair time solo as you will need to survive before you get to each other. The game is cool and I can recomend it."
1	Looking pretty good
-1	Where is game?
1	KUPI I NIST NE PITAJ...SUPPORTER PAKET nea zajebancije...jebenica igrica
1	 run around and die a bunch with no end gamewait till something endgame comes"
1	Nearly got killed my a giant robot.Told him his mom was a toaster.He runs awayI get loot11/10 Toasters For this review no toasters were damaged
1	 I enjoy the game.***selectively pulled from their discord***Welcome to the WHYSP.ORG Discord - for all of your gaming addons and plugin needs!GAMES WE SUPPORT:- CS:GO- Overwatch- PUBG- Fortnite- ARMA III- BDO- Brawlhalla- League of Legends (8.17 - online)- SCUM (NEW!)- World of Warcraft (NEW!)- teleport to GM Island (working)This page was last updated on 1 September 2018"
-1	 I run through entire D4 to C4 and came across 1 zombie (around 2km)Not recommended for the moment. 5/10"
1	 this game is well worth it!!!  If you like DayZ you will love this game!!"
-1	Barely any content wait for more updates to buy this game if you dont you will be pretty bored for the 1 and half hours you play before you refund it
-1	I refunded due to hackers.
1	 the effort that has gone into to released content is shaping up to be a great precursor for the direction and quality of the overall game and I think that is one BIG detail people have mostly overlooked.I wholeheartedly recommend backing this game in early access."
1	Great game Very fun and immersive
1	 it's compelling and worth the money even in early access."
1	It's the new Dayz but way better and Already running much better. With in a week of the game being out they already patched gaming breaking bugs. I suggest getting it while its 20$
-1	Ok so I got to play the game for few hours and now It's not letting me play it anymore? Did I get banned for some reason? If I did I want my $ back as this is BS. I did nothing wrong
-1	TRASHHHHHHHHH
1	 none of which will reward you anything of value as you already have endgame loot.Servers are to small 64 players on a map as big as this one is not really fulfilling. (took me 1 hour of gameplay to find another player with a full server.5/10 as of now."
1	Always wanted to play DayZ never got to it... Then heard of a better DayZ style game and its true! Rip DayZ
-1	 maybe hold on to your money until they work more kinks out."
1	 but I'd feel pretty silly taking the adivce of a raging dumbass who either has too little of an education or too short of an attention span to read a game description."
1	great game fun to gear up stealth about with mates or solo yolo. not much content as yet but great so far .
1	 however I have not had this issue when both parties are participating in combat. I also feel as though the mechs should recieve a slight nerf. The spotting range is quite further than one would first believe and they do insane amounts of damage including with the police vest on. The stealth skill seems to do nothing for this. Besides all this the game is still a lot of fun and much better than the counter parts such as Day Z. This game is easily worth the $20 if not more."
1	 coming out with updates every one to two days. I imagine that a lot of the promised content will be coming to scum within the next 3-6 months and will provide for a much more fulfilling experience."
-1	Terrible
1	50 FPS WITH A 970 OPTIMIZED WORSE THEN PUBG
1	>Woke up in the middle of a forest>Sharpen sticks to make a spear>Time to go kill some zambies>Run into 2 people geared to the teeth>I throw my spears>They shoot out my kneecaps>They s*** and p*** all over my bleeding agonizing body and leave me to die>I crawl home clean up and started playing scum and the same thing happened in Scum.  Crazy right?11/10 what a coincidence
1	The game is like half off my screen and i can't fix it lol
1	Great game with even greater potential. Has bugs and issues you would expect an early access game to have. However its clear the devs are working hard to make the game the best it can be.
-1	Tried to play the game for 40 mins and ran on lowest settings and couldnt even get a stable 30fps. Wouldn't even download if it were free. the videos and pictures that the producer of SCUM provide to viewers are unrealistic for the recomended hardware to even be able to run this EA game at playable framerates.
1	I think this game has great potential and honestly its beautiful. I just hope people remember that it is Early Access with 16 ppl making this game. This has given a great survival immersive game. Paid for standard version at first and have played now in only two days 25 hours and was happy to upgrade to the suporter dlc to help give that extra $$$
-1	 then I dont think it is worth the 20 bucks."
-1	 quite boring. just seems like a complex dayz"
1	[7/10]finally... you can take a dump in the game.
1	 but beyond that the game is fun and the danger is everywhere!"
-1	robot stealth simulator
1	i love it
1	 SCUM is basically undefeatable."
-1	thanks for the game because now i have to uninstall. hopfully thats more fun"
1	Drank dirty water and sh** my pants.10/10
-1	 everyhting is to far apart. wait for a bunch of updates before you buy this"
1	 unless they patch in a rocket launcher at some point.Buy this game."
-1	 in YEARS to come. There is no way this game is feature-complete within even two years though."
-1	 the most fun i've had in this laggy piece of garbage is crapping in a zombies mouth looking forward to the uninstall should be a blast"
1	It's funny how most of the bad reviews are written by people who spent more time writing the review than actually playing the game.
-1	same as dayz.......in 2018 we get this XD
1	 can ya'll go over and give Bohemia Interactive a hand with DayZ?"
-1	 hoping an upgrade will change my mindno point giving my opinion yet"
1	Love it!
1	Game is in Early access which fine but to be fair i hated day z but this game i actually enjoy alot and has alot of potential if the devs dont give up which i hope not i just bought the deluxe pack and currently loving this game
1	"
-1	The mech guys dont even shoot me.
-1	 as for now i have no way to recommend it"
1	 miscreated...ect. looks amazing! has great realisim. worth every penny"
-1	SCUM more like SCAM!
1	Drank a bottle of booze then passed out while swimming. Spent the next 5 minutes watching my charactor drown slowly.10/10 would drown again
-1	 But Been more than 2 hrs I wanted to give a real try. Right know Waste of time!!!"
1	 but the devs are well aware of this and are most likely working on it right now.If you want to follow the devopement of the game you can check out their website https://scumgame.com/en follow them on twitter https://twitter.com/ScumGame or watch livestreams on twitch. They only post major updates on the website and smaller updates og Twitter. On twitch you can watch how gameplay progresses and improves over time. One day you might be watching a streamer PVP'ing without any networking issues and so on."
1	 Scum is one of the Best EA releases of 2018.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/09/03/scum-rust-finally-has-some-competition/"
1	great game after you change some settings that the commuinty tells you to its runs very well
1	shutters and 40-50 fps in gtx 1050  1300hq......... fix please
-1	Hot Trash
1	 I recommend this game and think it has potential.  I had some funny moments with my friend over voicechat while we navigated this new game.  And everything I've said I imagine they're going to intend on fixing!  At least I hope!"
1	 but when it goes through multiple floors I feel like there should be a way you can get off on a floor and not have gravity push you all the way down. Other than that. Man this game is great and we instantly loved it!"
1	 but the very active Devs have fixed that. Overall a very enjoyable game."
1	Best Survival game.
1	 atleast it feels like that).Can't wait for fixes (and bigger hordes and cool random events)."
1	 brought me back.cant wait to see it develope. worth 20 bucks."
1	 especially that most are due to LAG or Perfomance. Its time to Upgrade your machine bro. Moreover its early access and its all ready more enjoyable than Dayz Misscreated and H1Z1.The future additions to this game look bright. and its well priced. worth every penny."
-1	Game is not fun at all it's gonna die in like a month its a rip off dayz just no please don't buy who am i kidding I can't tell you what to do with your money p.s don't buy XoXo
-1	Hot garbage even for beta.
-1	 no content. Another walking simulator."
1	 love the looks the feel of combat is immersive AF. love this game already"
1	 looking forward to whats to come."
1	 there are some severe memory leak issues that needs to be addressed in a timely manner and i have no doubts that they will be. After following this game for the better part of two years i can honestly and happily say that it has lived up to its hype and I look forward for what the future holds ofr Scum."
1	So far so good :)
1	 because that's about all you're gonna get here!"
1	 it's poorly playable and are only for those who doesn't care to face many bugs and a raw game. For those who demands a game with a minimum playable capability = Wait a little further or get it with a discount. For tose who loves realism and are very commited to the idea despite the bugs and rawness = Get it."
1	I like it.  Here are my reasons for thumbs uping this game....this $20 game.  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaNdYpqV66c&feature=youtu.be
1	it needs work but overall its fun
-1	No.
1	 and I'm super excited to see the upcoming updates with the base building and everything.Also my absolute favourite thing is the people leaving inane Bad Reviews for the worst reasons and not listing anything actually wrong and disabling the comments LMAO"
1	 but I haven't had any problems myself regardless of it being EA."
1	 this game has alot to implement. not a BR game"
1	Found some canned food but I didn't have a can opener. About 6 hours later took a poop and for some reason I decided to look at the poop and noticed that i pooped one out. 10/10 will play again.
1	 which is nice.Im looking forward to keep an eye on this game."
1	 could be a 10/10 if the devs fix the dsync and frame drop."
1	Fan of survival? buy this. immediatly. <3
-1	In three days I played a total I think around 5 hours and done nothing more then run around a forrest doing NOTHING.  This game is BORING ig you think I'm lying buy it
-1	 right now as it is. I can't even start it up and had to get my refund."
1	Very intricate metabolism system but if you just eat some food and drink you will be fine. Hardcore survival with a group of Dev's who have already put out 3 patches in 5 days. It's not for everyone and MP servers are laggy right now but we aren't even a week in. Iv'e already killed two Mecha and having a blast hunting puppets and wildlife! 10/10
1	Needs Some optimalization but for EA i think its a pretty good gameFor me it was worth the money
1	 and actually go search you should be fine. i have engaged every person i have encountered except one or two fresh spawns and the gunplay is pretty decent.  needs a little bit of tweaking probably but it is much better than rust imo.  i have also caught a few shots when i wasn't expecting them and turned the fight to my favor.  the shots to kill varies i assume but it usually feels right.  have not emptied a mag just to be looked at and shot.   im very hopefull the devs deliver on all their promises because this will be the survival winner once that's done."
-1	 I wont be able to recommend this game to anyone who has interests in doing anything outside of shoot on sight pvp."
1	 but time would say."
-1	 but that mechanic on it's own isn't enough to keep you interested. There is no end-game. You can only gear up and then hope you find another player."
1	 at this moment you will need good hardware in order to play this enjoyably."
1	 But still very good game!"
1	 now it is the time for SCUM to shine. Of course it has some bugs to fix but it is what early access is for. It's already an amazing game and so f*** much potential.Had a diarrhea attack in front of a mech. 10/10."
1	 best EA so far. Just to counter those mixer reviews kids"
1	 surrounded by zombies and mechs... stared at a wall the entire time... 10/10"
1	 is amazing."
1	Good one
-1	this is just survive with better graphics i  run around for about an hour with a shot gun an a pistol with no ammo starving and bored refud request all ready sent
-1	 I LIKED IT.But by now it's very unplayable. Just see if devs will work nicely and fix the bugs fast ;)"
1	just needs time to get bugs fixed and fps fixed. this is only out today as alpha. people need to chill.
1	 wait couple of months if you expect AAA title in early access for 17$"
1	Yes it has a few problems it's just came out but already in a better place than Dayz. Just think what this will become.
1	i think the game is good but quite hard to run. the only thing that is annoying me with my fps is that when ever i move into new areas i got frame drops because it is loading in more but cant they just make it so it loads in the map before you get in like rust or dayz.
-1	 but the same boredom."
1	 they feel too different. But it's above Dayz and miscreated for sure."
1	1nice
-1	 uninstalled & refunded."
-1	Alison Hudson doesn't approve
-1	DONT GET IT UNTIL SERVER PERFROMANCE IMPROVES!!!!!
-1	At this very moment this game is very raw. But I hope devs will improve the situation. But now it's not worth of buying [08.29.18]
-1	Bad game. Bad knock off of Dayz and h1z1. I'd rather play unturned instead
1	devs are promising
1	It's not perfect yet and it only came out couple hours ago but I am already having a blast!
1	 and enjoying it!"
1	A lot more polished than Day z. This game is actually fun. Awesome visuals too! The devs seem to be doing what they said and keeping up with the community. Totally worth the $20.
1	 the map is very big and takes ages to find anyone.memory leaks after a few hours"
1	Don't listen to the neckbeards. This game is awesome.
1	 this game will be the only ""zombie"" survival game to play imoI will update this review at some point but already its worth suggesting to try it out."
1	I got a vitamin deficiency just like in real life best game ever!
1	Had diarrhea during a guinfight causing me to die... 10/10 gamehttps://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousRacyWalrusResidentSleeper
1	 I didn't attempt to solve any of the problems i have stated. i just want this game to be good for the developers and the community.Thank you"
1	 the game is fantastic!"
-1	::Pro's::Good graphicsFairy OptimizedInteresting/unique concept::Con's::Incredibly boringLooting simulator 101
-1	Won in Christmas giveaway. Not enough substnace. Needs more. Deathmatch is best part of game. Disapointed :/
1	Game is unplayable. pls fix
-1	 but again for now if you've already played DAYZ you aren't missing anything."
1	What more do I need to say other than that you can poop on your enemies. 10x better than DayZ and cheaper definitely should give it a shot if you like the genre.
-1	 Walking simulator 2018."
1	Ive been enjoying this game with hardly any issues other than fps dips
1	 as I Know you will. Screw the ""hurt feelings"" crowd! PC Master Race / anti-SJW!"
1	 the game is well optimized relative to other EA survival games."
-1	 this game is a close second to one of the most terrible games I've played. Too much hype for this garbage"
1	For now all I can say is: It's DayZ but better in every way. This is what I always wanted DayZ to be like!

1	Would poop on top of a Dam again 10/10 :)
-1	 but you cant go outside because the robots will start shooting at you and you will die..."
1	Very good for an early access game.Great details and stable gameplay
1	 impressed."
-1	 press reload and WOW..the ammo is finally in the ammo slot. I'll play this for a while more and if it doesn't get any better..I'm done with it."
1	foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooking awesome game!
1	 deal with it. Great potential so get the game if you want to support the devs(don't forget to bug report it helps alot)."
1	It blows my mind that this has any negative reviews. It is everything we wanted from DayZ and all the things we didn't know we wanted.An absolute steal for 20 dollars.
-1	 this cr@p is for you..."
1	 still in early stages of development but in a better position then some that have been released."
1	 best meat ever10/10 would kill person and eat again"
1	i pooped on somebody so i guess its worthy of a positive review
1	 and the devs have done a great job"
-1	 so if you hate that kind of thing wait until full release.For now all I will say is this game has great potantial to be a fun and adictive game. But for now I advice you too wait and see."
-1	played couple hours sofar nothing but frustration
1	 think about DayZ Early Access it was terrible. So give Scum a Chance and let them 17 Devs some time!"
1	Extremly fun and addictive
-1	...
1	 but I can't wait to get more stuff implemented.Keep on the good work!"
-1	Remove the robots = positive review
1	 still dying before meeting up with friends and then running across the whole map10/10 best spent 20 bucks on steam"
1	 needs a bit more content to really be great"
1	 I got 100 hours of running its enough for me..."
-1	 cuz this is the time you need to find any weapons. Even as a free to play title this game would be to expensive."
-1	This being a new game i guess you have to cut it some slack but if i were someone reading this review i would definitely wait 6 months before buying this game because its simply trash at the moment. it is one of the most boring games i have ever played and is also one of the biggest let downs. super excited when i first saw gameplay for it. now i regret spending the money
1	 this game can be very fun. I do reccomend it for an easy $20.00"
1	 but even with the few of us we have  a blast. Trying to sneak past mechs into a military base for that good loot is exilirating. I hope that the developers continue what they have been doing and take this game to new heights. Hopefully soon they will include a bicycle or perhaps tameable horse to ride to get around the map easier. Other than that it's a very enjoyable and highly realistic survival/apocalypse simulator."
-1	 cant seem to keep it up at all. Too much to worry about instead of actually enjoying the game. Perhaps they could include building forts / camps?? gets tiring running around after you find all the military loot. Not much to do after that."
-1	 they'll run you down like a dog)  you might as well just die and start over."
1	Great game!
1	Money Well Spent for me"
1	so good i'd buy it for a friend.
-1	LOWER THE DAMN MIN REQ!I Cant Play with 24 avg - 35fps 1% time onlyAND I have been waiting for this game for so longOthers game that i cant run on my old laptopi Can deal with it because i wasnt so hype about the gameGood thing you have the price at $19.99 because if it would cost like $60.00 no one would careAnd please make a damn ASIAN Server so that i and everyone else dont have to suffer lagAnd i would recommend adding a sandbox mode so that people can enjoy beating zombies with their boxing gloveAnd get rid of hackers i know you're gonna do it anyway but on my first server theres a hackerIts sad that i cant play the game ive been waiting for so please to what i saidSo all of your players could enjoy your gameAnd i dont want to spend any money on a High end GPUIf you fix all of this problems the game will be more balancedand i know that i just spend 2 hours in the game its because i have gave up to play SCUM because all the reason up thereThis is your chance to make a great gameIm sorry if im to RUDE but i am desperate to play the game properly.
-1	HACK FEST.
1	Scum has great potential. It is an early access game so keep that in mind.
1	 but nothing to really do after you find all the best gear. You just wander around and avoid being killed after that. No real goal."
1	 Theres things being ironed out by the devs but its a great survival experience. Multiplayer is polluted with hackers right now so try the single player mode if thats your thing if not then wait until things get sorted but for now just trying to keep myself alive is fun enough."
1	10/10 would recommend!Here in voice chat as I'm running. COME BACK DUDE LEMME F YOU.F = Add player to squad!LMAO
1	What tf is DayZ?
-1	 extremely disappointing"
1	What DayZ Should of been .... Great Game tbh just a shame about the hackers. but they are working to fix it... Glitches just make the game more fun :D
-1	 someone who LOVES Dayz. getting into this game until it's FULLY optimized"
1	Very good early acces game desync and stuff yes but you cant really expect too much from an early acces title but i still recommend it
-1	 will try again in a few months to see if its changed."
1	 i have had a lot of fun with this game so far."
1	yep its not easy in any way. i love it. if you rage quit in pubg this is not for you.
-1	!DISCLAIMER SCUM FANBOYS TRIGGER WARNING!Basically this game is DayZ Standalone at its prime but will die eventually if the Developers will not give the consumers what they want the most e.g. BASE BUILDING/FORTIFICATION and VEHICLES. Right now there is no end game which just resolves in getting absolutely geard and PVPing other players BUT....... WE HAVE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN look at how DayZ Standalone has turned out to be and it scares me to see another game like this that has MASSIVE POTENTIAL. Like come on this is 2018 we shouldnt be getting something like this which is a repeat. I just hope the developers have learned from DayZ Standalone's Mistake
1	Tbh this game is really great and I enjoy playing it. It has a few ups and downs such as bugs but it is still an Alpha game. I believe this game has a lot of potential (more than Dayz ever had). A few things I'd like to see fixed are: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-Servers in the Server List should show the IP so it's easier to connect & play with friends-Fix the BCU (It's a little to much)-Make the crafting UI a little more flush and easier to use-Buff the Hunger (I would eat a whole meal and be stuffed on the BCU then about 5 minutes go by and i'm starving)-Buff the Stamina/Energy slightly -Make it harder to get Military gear-Nerf the Sentries/Mechs slightly (They can currently 2 tap  you unless you bob and weave you may escape)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I may add on to the list but as I stated it's still an Alpha game and I'm looking forward to the Devs adding More things & Patching Bugs.
1	good game bro
1	It's like DayZ Stand-alone but playable.
-1	Melee combat is f*cking sh!t5/10
1	Needs a bit more polishing and optimisation but thier is alot of potential for this game.
-1	 there's no search option. Trying to find the servers through the time option or players tab doesn't work because there's over 3k servers and they all are trying to load at once and it will overtake the other ones and make the one you were looking at go all the way to the bottom. This is the type of game I only play with friends so when we're walking around doing nothing it's not as boring. So not having a good way to join friends is a big no no for me."
1	 etc."
1	Very good game. The one i was waiting for from along time (since the death of dayZ hehe) Hope the dev wont give up and continue the fixes (keep in mind it is an alpha).
1	 can't wait to see whats coming next."
1	 there is no thirst. There is only salt."
1	 it's just missing features that will be added over the forseable future.The game runs like a beauty.Also it helps that it's really fun.Buy it."
-1	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Need more concent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	 for like 1 second.)"
1	very good game and devs update whats needed. looks like they have much already finished and just want too run a clean game before implamanting the other stuff!!! great work
1	Like DayZ but awesome
1	The game is pretty good and its very unique. There's definately alot of work to be done but the devs are doing a great job with the constant updates. +1
-1	Game failed to start
-1	I do not approve the zombie buff. fix it.
1	 the metabolism page is really good and i like how you have to watch what you eat so you can optimize how your character plays. It does take time trying to cross the map to find your group but hopefully they'll add vehicles. Its a great looking game and hopefully there will be some more content added soon."
1	Keep up the amazig work. I'm extremely picky and a huge critic with every game I play. I can honeslty say hands down this is the best open world multiplayer survival game i've encountered. It's ppretty much DayZ on steriods. There is always a nice amoutn of content. KEEP ADDING MORE and this will be more than a million dollar game. Easy.
1	7/10i really enjoy playing this game . There are bugs and other problems with the game however i have faith in the developers to fix them and further improve the game =D
-1	BAD
1	 I was pretty happy to see the state of this game when it launched and all the support the devs have been giving it. It's nice to see a developer who actually listens to community feedback this well. Recommended if you like sadistically torturing other players or if you've always wanted to have explosive diarrhea in a video game."
1	 here's your game."
1	+++++
1	 Scum is amazing. (8/10)"
1	Just 10/10 no comment.
1	 gets a thumbs up from me as support for future development."
1	 Mechanics work well and the game has a solid base to build on going forward."
1	Awesome gameIt is unoptimized and the servers have some issues but its an early access after allThe price is stunning Emperor Palpatine / Do it
-1	badly broken game.
1	 but that is what makes the game fun and not repetitive when you with full on gear!So I hope the game continues growing strong and continues to improving =) PS : All the best for all the guys working on this for the past years! Thank you for an incredible game and such a phenomenal piece of art. And thank you for making a game to by hyped about!"
1	 where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival."
-1	 not worth buying for now. They need focus on optmization ASAP"
1	 it deserve it"
1	 but nothing big enough for me to rage like a spoiled child. This is good enough for a early access release and I really enjoy this game. The metabolism system is amazing and very smart. Eating food needs to digest and break down in order for you to get the full results of what your eating. Finding gear is not that bad. In about 30 minutes MAX you will have decent loot. (If you know what your doing)"
-1	 dayz is better than this and i hate dayz!"
-1	 and pleople start roleplaying. Maybe I can change my mind (but Miscreated is a bad precedent)."
1	 let it mature for a bit and see if it improves."
1	 no servers to start.. welcome to EA!! Day one an its already pooping and peeing on DayZ's 5 year old rotting corpse. If you like survival with a bit of an arcady feel to it do yourself a favour and buy this game.. if you are impatient and want a AAA game fully polished then don't buy it and wait its in EA for a reason"
1	 but thats the survival struggle. haha"
1	Im able to run this game on an nvidea 940m and and i5 dual core with ht (both beeing under minimun requirements). Also the game and the developers seem very promising. I would totally recomend anyone to try it out
1	 if you didn't suck you would have fame points and you can spawn on your squad. Man up fam learn the game."
1	This Game is far better then any other Survival Game on Day One and this is just the beginning.
-1	It's simply not ready.
1	Nice game!
1	 but instead of falling down the path of it's parents it got it's life together and did something amazing. THIS IS WHAT SURVIVAL GAMES SHOULD BE10/10 please keep this a SURVIVAL game."
1	 lots to explore and keeping up on your Food intake is more important than Murdering people. Can't wait to see what other features get put in a month or two down the road."
1	Very fun game its a much better Dayz and is still early in dev this game is amazing for the current state of the game
-1	Not working properly
1	 ever. I think that maybe some storing system like housing could be nice (obviously raidable).10/10 can be 11/10 if the little things get fixed."
-1	The gameplay is legit too realistic.its more of a survival game than anything else. So the game can be boring for a good portion of people.thats why i wouldnt recommend it to mors of people.
1	Buy it. Its just 20$ for now.
1	 so i have no doubts ill be enjoying the full experience soon."
1	blatant fortnite clone
-1	Don't waste your time. Boring as F$#*
1	is very nice game
1	Really great gam ejust wish my shelter and storage containers didnt disapear all the time...
1	Rock solid foundation for a great long style survival game.
1	This game does have potential but its not optimised well. I have a decent pc and even with every thing on low settings I get horrible frames. Im gonna reccomend it because it does look like a very good game though.
1	pls fix FPS Drops
1	 the Dev's seem commited and I really recommend this EA title!!!"
-1	Fix the disconnecting and the optimization and I'll buy it again.
-1	ton of character customization features are locked and when im trying to connect a server it failsDONT BUY THIS GAME(at least not now)"
-1	not what it seems like literally minecraft and pubg put together
1	 it made a goat sound. 10/10"
1	Really cool sandbox game!! highly recommend it!
-1	 this is still a running simulator) to get 1 tapped by a dragunov while running to a town.Without base building/fortifying ability there is no where to put all the loot you get after hours of grinding there is nothing to do and no way to save anything you grind out. To get 1 tapped in the head while running 2 times in almost 10 hours of gameplay in which 90% of it is running and looting Is not a fun experience at all. Combined with the poor optimization and server crashes this game would be worth in my eyes about 5-10$ at its current state.All that being said this game has a LOT of potential and I hope I dont see this ending up like DayZ standalone. I am also aware that this 10 hour gameplay is the first 24 hours after the release of the game.. However it does not justify the bad experience I had with giving it a good review. This is to help anybody who is looking at this to hopefully get a better understanding of the average buyers experience.All in all I'd recommend steering clear from this game until further updates/patches. Keep doing what you're doing devs."
1	 Since they even point to the direction some one is.- dropping your gun. When you have 2 slots full and your hands are full you drop that thing you have. Now this is mostly your gun. But it would be nice if your done using your hands that you automaticly just pick up your gun again. I lost a few guns/toolboxes this way and saw this happen on streams to.Would I recommend the game in the current state. No. eventough this is one of the best early access releases I have played. I even think its better then Dayz standalone in its current state after 3 years.But I said yes because I am supprised about how good it is allready and if they fix the FPS/Servers alone it will be fun enough."
-1	It's just boring and poorly optimized.
1	 as they prooved their skills and interesting point of view on survivals."
1	 and frustration at times."
1	Addictive.https://youtu.be/ePYGYbPnNKE
1	Very fun and polished for an early access game will Definitely sink hours into this game.
1	The dayz killer. It was worth the money and the wait.
1	Great Game
-1	wow. This game is trash.
1	YOU CAN PEE ON DEAD BODY.     10/10
-1	 fires and so on will vanish when you close the game! This is pretty much forcing people into renting if they don't want to keep the game running 24/7 to stop from starting all over again! This is prety much game breaking to me and a real nasty secret tax on the player! I can see a refund in my future if I don't find a solution fast and the devs will ban you from the forum if you highlight this!"
1	better than dayz? maybe they sure made a really complicated system work pretty damn well. GET ON THE EVENTS GUYS! try it out for 20 bucks its the best survival game you can buy that has not been in EA for 5 years ;)
1	best survaving game ever
1	 but you guys seem to be on top of trying to fix it..."
-1	 there is absoultely nothing to do good luck even finding anyone when youre actually looted oh and dont even think of storing your items anywhere  because theyll just disappear which goes back to the point im making its a huge waste of time"
-1	 and wish it gets bigger and bigger so it can change to be the greatest survival game ever. thanks for making such an amazing game!"
1	 and otherwise a good game to start off with."
1	Feels like the original DAYZ mod with lots of neat additionals.Character creator that actual effects your stats.Indepth Statics you can track to make sure your Prisoner is in top form.Crafting SystemMap looks great. High End Loot isnt overdone and there is actual risk to getting it (not just other players).Would recommend this game to all who like DAYZ or other Survival type games.Heres to opening that the Devs keep up with their current roadmap!
1	 i have 3 rifles and each 50 round of ammo and cant use any of them."
-1	 but it was just too boring. Had more fun in a few minutes in The Forest than in 4 hours here"
1	 or why can't they stop defacating everywhere."
1	has a lot of potential! cant wait to see what they do. the dayz killer! if dayz wasnt already dead
-1	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO....
-1	way too many bugsbad performanceshould not be in early accessconclusion: crap game
-1	I'm familiar to the early access games. This one is really smooth for an early access game. Fps is low but you don't feel it because game is soooooooooo slow paced. I liked the detailing they included. But it feels like running simulator. Also i don't think it'll be fun to play multiplayer because it's so complex.
1	really fun game
1	So far its an amazing game!
-1	 maybe you should wait with the purchase.."
1	 and it would seem very attentive/devoted devs. Keep it up!"
-1	 I don't recommend."
1	Spawned inGot some foodZombie came after me RanOut ran the zombieTook a quick poopGot a weapon and got killed by a high secured place with good loot10/10 would poop again
1	i dont know how it is to play alone but playing whit friend or bro its fun ! :) and big map !"
-1	Not very fun.
-1	 you kill players and die in horible ways but you won't show a bum in an animation while squeezing one off or a peen and balls when you take a whizz. Hey everyone loves the hillarity of it but you got to commit. lazy.Wait a few years for the game to develop into a game worth buying because as of now its got nothing to keep me playing. xoxo gossip girl."
1	The best game i cant play right now because i broke my hand.  I might try anyway. I still have the use of my pointer finger. Terrible timing that because ive been anticipating its release for a while. But back to the game. Its crafting is well thoughtout and consistantly useful. The food and body composition system is ynique nd really cool. I like the breakdown of whats in your stomach and the realtime needing to pee and poop ingame. It plays comparably to dayz but is less buggy and feels more complete in its current build in my opinion. the map features a lot of unique and distinct locations like weird tunnels and a vineyard i found one time. I look forward to playing again in 5-6 weeks and reccommend you buy it in the meantime.
1	Definitely worth the money.
-1	 causing massive lag."
-1	No....
1	 this game could very easily become the best survival game of all time."
1	 it has such detailed survival mechanics unseen anywhere else and I can easily recommend getting it"
1	Is don is good
1	Great game needs lotssssssss of optimizing...
1	Amazing game so far in its early state. Great job by the devs. I can't wait for the day where people understand the point of early access. To continue to see complaints of an unfinished game is both juvenile and ignorrant.
1	gg
-1	 occasionally freezes and even when running at its ""best"" just looks off? Like constant minor screen tearing."
-1	 tedious crafting. Bad game."
1	 the exploring and hyper realism of this game is unrivaled. If you're a fan of these types of game you can't pass up Scum."
-1	 the game might be worth playing. As it stands the game is simply boring. Perhaps a revisit in six months to a year may prove fruitfull but for now i recommend waiting."
-1	"""No items found!""""No items found!""""No items found!""Followed by UNCEASING heartbeats that last forever. Ridiculous."
1	 and was able to find stuff and you can always hunt animals and/or scavenge crops for supplies."
1	Absolutely amazing
-1	 avoid."
1	 I would consider this game worth 20 dollars!"
1	 by foot takes way too long."
1	 you need to poop too."
1	 I hope the devs keep it up."
1	A pretty standard Day Z clone with some new features.  You actually have to use your brain guys.
-1	 alot more time.P.S i actually like the crafting system aswell as having to maintain your heartrate and calorie intake."
-1	 no."
-1	 robots are not your only threats and loot is a little more findable the game will be great. I don't recommend it for now."
1	 please let this game succeed."
-1	I don't want to complain about optimization of this game because it is still an alpha game however servers are keep disappearing to some players and servers are tremendously unstable. you guys should've considered about server issues before launch this game. Game's concepts are fun and enjoyable. Please just fix the server issue.
-1	 its not far enough to enjoy or consider good. has potential maybe but I can see it fading."
1	 I prefer EFT currently."
1	Best survival game you can play .
1	 graphics and killing other players or teaming up for a better round. But always keep an eye open for betrayal.Having a blast."
1	 see you on there!"
1	 clipping and major improvments as the game continues to be developed. If you like open world survival this is the best one going. and its 20 bucks"
1	 I want to see how this game evolves and I'm looking forward more content."
1	 many promising Early Access games that turned into never-ending-early-access-games or went in a wrong diraction in developement and from something promising ended up as never-reached-own-potential product. So I just hope that SCUM will have a good developement rate and noticable content updates that encourage you to dig deeper instead of just read change-log and not even trying it out.For now - game is great and worth the price. Time will tell if it gonna be the game that completly change the survival games genre or just a game worth mention after couple year - there was this game with interesting metabolism system but nothing more."
1	I had a friend last night encounter a glitch to where he had hypothermia and heatstroke at the same time making him puke every five seconds while trying to raid a boot camp with two other friends of mine. I will it was the best 3 hours of I've ever played in any game for a really long time.
-1	just bought game 24hrs ago but the snowflakes were listened to and pandered to in a safe space 8 and 14 digit tatoos removed due to the crying of snowflakes how sad are deveelopers that remove crap for snowflakes
1	Damn good game. Very hard and still missing a LOT of content but the base is there. Loving it.
1	 can't wait to see where they take this"
1	*****
1	 it's a bargain if you enjoy this genre. Highly recommend people try it out."
-1	The Game needs more time its to unfinished
-1	 even with all the features they want to implement I dont see this going anywhere."
1	 it is fun to play but not playable because of lag and Stuttering ."
1	If you bought Dayz and enjoyed it then i think you will enjoy this."
1	fun game consant fps drops made it unplayable thoe
1	 but otherwise it's worth every penny. Beauiful game and active devs."
1	 I got the diarrhea."
1	 people need to cut the devs some slack and give them time to fix the server issues and crack on with adding in all the missing features. If they keep up at the pace they have been going it will end up being a really decent game."
1	just to fix some lagging and a little bit of loot randomizing."
-1	 no goals or objectives. nothing special in this game its a waste of money"
1	Buy this game. Pretty much hooked!
1	chur
-1	Lagspike:the game
-1	too many hackers!!!
1	 we are counting on you that you can make this a best survival ever! Continue with the pace you're already going and teach the devs which made survival games and then left them how to be a good developer. You have something special over her i belive in you! wish you all the best.P.S. i love all the Croatian references in the game! Pelinkovac!"
1	and vomit on command-realistic survival systems based upon real science-This game is created by people who will actually finish it-enough content in this game already to provide hours of entertainment-I have never encountered a hacker yet"
1	What can I say except this game is so much fun. I absolutely love the level of detail that has went into the management of your character. I have been playing with a bunch of friends and I have never laughed so hard in my life purely due to certain mechanics in this game. Although the game currently is short of content I am genuinely excited by the roadmap put in place by Gamepires and I am fully looking forward to see how this game evolves through the early access period. Of you like playing games with mates this is definitely worth a pick up.
-1	Fix the mechs and maybe we'll talk.
-1	 even if u start in singleplayer mode allmost everything is empty. They have to implement vehicles maybe that will save the day and way more zombies..."
-1	 massive waste of $19.99 USD. Barely even played it but too long for any refund. Crazy that an early access unfinished game can permanetly ban someone yet take our money. My fingers are crossed that they realise the FK up and sort it out...."
1	but i cant find that option"
1	next level... Perfection... Just remember if you gonna play this game you have to think your character like a real persondont overeatdont run like hella lot dont's soAct like a real !
1	 Im sure it will evolve into something great over time.  Hasnt been any hackers since they implemented anti cheat a few days ago.  It is similar to rust without the basebuilding."
-1	 when it runs. Don't even attempt to download unless you have a high end gaming computer that far exceeds the ""minimum"" requirements. You'll just get frustrated with crashes and frame loss"
1	 not to mention everything planned for v1.0 and beyond."
1	 it's great so far!"
1	my character saw a giant robot that threatened to kill him and then urinated in pants when I ran and hid. seems pretty good.
1	This game is great and you should give it a try! who wouldn't want to squeez the lemon in the forest and take solid dumps! 10/10 IGN But seriously though try it. Obviously it has a few bugs and missing content but it's in alpha so what can you expect. In my opinion RIP Dayz.
-1	 but other than that this game is the go to survival game if you enjoy DayZ/Rust"
1	 it'll be insane."
1	 had to uninstall. Fun."
-1	Mechs should be nerfed or even removed its like impossible to even loot some military spots since they 1 tap you through walls
-1	 just crash"
1	 it all works well and runs smooth. honestly i had a lot of fun just in the first 30 mins of the game and if a game can get me excited in the first hour its going to be good . IMO"
1	 also the fact it just hit early accessAlso not everyone alive in a server needs to die remember that.Its 20$ currently I say honestly give it a shot."
1	Lol ignore the bad reviews. this game is dayz x10000 (coming from someone with 1.8khrs in dayz)
1	 and stop reading reviews!"
-1	 but being able to see your party members' names through walls isn't."
1	I ate a whole watermelon in one bite 10/10
1	 will update this review once I've played it longer."
-1	if you like running through the forest for 2 hours just to get killed by a wallhacking robot... this game is for you!
1	more gore please....
1	 or get almost perma locked on. Game has TONS of potential. I will continue to play as long as i can get the sound to work. pc specs: i5 3.2ghz quad core.16 gb ramgtx 1060 6 gb120gb ssdruns game on almost all high setting with 60+ fps. But did crash because of a GPU error. It 2 framed and never recovered. Restarted and lost sound. tried multiple times and still have no sound at all."
1	 if dayz was like this game on Day1... but took 4 years to be 10% of SCUM"
-1	Delayed for servers and servers down. Less troll and more work next time
1	rust and other survival games."
1	This new update finally turns DayZ into the pre alpha early access game it was always meant to b- *connection timed out*
1	Downloading Scum was a better experience then Ive had with Dayz
1	This game is awesome.
1	RIP PUBGshit and DayZ.
1	Great game
1	I pooped in sink and wiped my hole with my bare hand. I guess DayZ missed on that. 10/10.
-1	 First person has bad head bobbing and no way to turn it off. If I were you I would WAIT on this EA title."
1	 even the crap in the game has it's own movement and jiggle physics!GOTY 2018 and any year onwards."
1	Flawless.
1	 I hope they fix optimization next!"
1	 promising future for this game!"
-1	Server crashes every 5 minutes. Impossible to play.
1	HYPE HYPE HYPE!
1	Sh!t on people 10/10
1	Great game apart from the delay by almost an hour. Staying up late for this one carrrrn!
1	 this game is hardddd...one that you're going to have to invest alot of time into to be able to get in the higher ranks.(Next update at 5 hours)"
1	I am revering my review after dev updating the game. it feels good it got wrong on the start but getting better for each day but hackers is a problem u can hack with cheat engine rlt lol. But frome that the game is good i reccomend everyone who read this buy it but not the deluxe edition. you only get 2 ingame items and one mystery item when you poop and the rest u find in the game folder which is just images for u to print out what a scam of 8euro
1	 it is not a bad thing but they need side missions where really good loots is so people can stop camping and actually move over the map.I will buy a copy for my bro and couple of friends as a gift and so should you :D"
1	Very impressed with the EA release. For 20$ this is worth it.
-1	 or the players. You just run around aimlessly collecting loot you cant actually carry around with you.I would hold off on buying this game till one or two content/gameplay updates are released."
1	 truly THE survival game to play atm."
1	Solid for an EA. Devs are quick to respond and address any issues. It's only been up on steam for a few days people so relax.
-1	 the devs don't care."
-1	Scientific management of your metabolism is probably the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a video game. That this game could move forward after inserting racist content is surprising to me as well. Watching my game character take a dump and relieve their bladder....not only disturbing but exactly what I dont need in the games I play. I reccomend you pass.
1	10/10 i got murdered by a so called friendly nigerian and indian team damn im never trusting those species again
-1	no objective
-1	Bit Gay
1	gr8 game sir! good job
-1	 its nearly impossible to shoot someone when they are running just fix it otherwise the player base will just drop"
1	oke this game is fun i give you that. when you know the basics yea. only there is one downside of this game that you need a great computer but thats my fault. i am looking forward for a new computer to play this game !! btw i am playing on a 950m laptop haha. but just buy the game they are going to inprove it !
1	 i wont be surprised if they are working on some ""in house"" anti cheat option as im writing this."
1	 which is already my money's worth. $20 for 2 hours of entertainment is more than I usually get. This one is promising and I don't believe it's another DayZ clone cash grab. Please don't break my heart devs. <3"
1	Gamepires & Croteam just took ownership of the entire survival genre.
1	 and it was worth the wait."
1	I'm really hoping this is the one. Please be the one...
1	+1 positive review
1	 this game doesnt seem quite complete and has quite the learning curve but it is a healthy level of challenging. I just wish it was easier to find people to team up with. Also be sure that you enlighten yourself to the dangers so you dont get slaughtered by some giant robot like i did :/"
1	 went back to picking and eating grapes because I was hungry again."
-1	 i couldnt bare to play it another minute. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1	Limited content but very fun and the survival is so IMMERSIVE!!!!!!twitch.tv/Chilled_lime     Plz follow ;P
-1	 maybe it will be a great game sometime later down the line."
-1	 but after a short time you will understand its just a mix of some Arma mods (bad ugly mix) on Unreal Engine."
-1	 but so was DayZ."
-1	 not to mention the lootfest that this game is.And after gathering all the loot you can and getting geared up to the max there is not much else left to do other than searching for other players on the massive empty map and trying to shoot them while they rubberband across your screen."
1	When fortification hits this will be the bomb!!
1	Dayz but better
1	It's a good price but a little high for the lack of gameplay. Never used the guns cuz I never found people and i played on a server with 30+ players. I still enjoy the game and will play through early access. I'm looking forward to see how this plays out. I do still prefer DayZ tho and would play that before this every day if it wasn't for the lack of players. Still worth a thumb up for the low price and I've only played three hours so far. I will change my review after more hours if my opinion changes.
1	 SCUM does not give that feel. I actually enjoy going through the towns looking for items because it feels like I am actually trying to survive. From the in-depth BCU stats to the vitamin/food type information it really feels like you are trying to stay alive.The zombies are top notch. They can pose a threat if they catch you unaware but most of the time it is easy to take them out or navigate around them.The graphics are out of this world. HOWEVER....... I can usually only run it for about 30 min before it crashes my GPU. I have a GTX 1060 6GB so I am not sure why I am having this issue. I have turned all the graphics down so if anyone has any other ideas I would love to hear them.I cannot wait for more and more patches and content to come out. This game has serious potential and absolutely worth $20+"
-1	'scum could not load your proffile'
1	Best survival game so faar. But can u please add that the items in the Box won't disappear in the single player.
1	 or more realistic than it needs to be. Remember that first and foremost this is a game! We need to keep having fun to keep playing it!"
1	I enjoy this game alot and i am totally ready to see what more they have to bring for us.
-1	Lag and low frame rate.Still cant play it at the moment as the frame rate is so terrible I cant do anything. So much lag I cant play at all and PvP is just so buggy. Even single player is a no go as soon as you fight Puppets its so slow. The crafting is over complicated in most areas. Even opening a can is silly.The metabolism tab is just not needed. Its hard enough staying alive building and crafting. You need to be able to play the game. Id say eating is too much at the moment. I eat 2 candy bars 2 tin of spagetti and a banana and I was still hungry. Thats just stupid. It looks great. Just needs to be less complicated in most areas. I cannot recommend this game as it stands its good to help out on early access but its not really playable for me. Plus not being able to build a shelter till your a higher rank is supid we are talking about a crappy wooden shack.
1	 then content."
-1	Looted 8 hoursGot killed by an invisible guyALT + F410/10
1	 however this game is extremely well balanced for its state. For $20 you cant really complain."
1	So far so good
1	 houses for clothes and food with very rare chances for weapons. A lot of effort went into the game to get it where it is and from the developers YouTube channels they seem pretty adament about keeping this game alive and running. I am satisfied with my purchase."
1	 is food. berries and small bits dont do enough to keep me in it. In my 2 hours of game play Ive starved 3 times. Pretty sad. So far the game is fun but I would wait a bit if youre hesitant."
-1	 it crashes constantly and it is not worth buy. Give it a year then maybe."
-1	 and an 8700k and my fps starts at 100 and drops to 40-50 within an hour of playtime. No matter my settings turning to low only slows down the process and puts stress on my cpu."
-1	scum is a VERY bad game. People teleport 200 meters at a time and u can't shoot anyone. PVP is mission impossible and zeds frick u up and u can't hit them back. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
1	I like this game a lot so far
1	 that bear -_-"
1	The game is great. True zombie survival. Very advanced gameplay and lots of action. This game will go far if the project is not abandoned like Day-Z. Server rental is quick and easy. Grab a few friends and get ready to have some hardcore survival fun!
1	SCUM has achieved at launch what DAYZ couldn't.
-1	 doesn't justify a whole team behind this game where they can release it as paid pre alpha but not enough content. Stay away for now unless you got no other games to play."
1	 Devs are working hard on perfecting the game which has great future in Survival genre."
-1	 so I wouldn't be surprised if it did."
1	 but the content is all that bad."
1	 this could turn into the DayZ we all wanted in 2013. Good Game. Good Devs. Good Price."
-1	   03.9.2018."
-1	There is like no loot.over 600h in arma 2 overpoch.this is not dont in ling time!
1	 without success.SCUM did the trick for me.10/10 - would bleed to death alone again."
1	Game so veri good #nMControllingScumLands
1	Love this game. IF you enjoy survival games I'd highly reccomend.
1	Day 1 release already has more content then dayz
1	 but besides the game breaking bugs(which are gonna be fixed) this game needs more weu servers cause its really hard connecting to the american servers and join the few northern europian servers that are empty and high pinged!"
-1	 unplayable on lowest settings possible."
-1	 how pointless off a game and takes years to meet up with friends...."
1	 awesome game man !!! :D"
-1	Another early access survival game with really high pc specs needed to run above 30FPS
1	 doing this helped decrease stuttering and smoothed it out. I'm getting 48-60 fps with Res at 70 on Med / High graphic settings"
1	7 Euros it is awesome experience. Let's hope developers will finish it with all the features as they promised."
1	 a little but it showed me how powerful the mechs really are but the risk reward is worth it. This game had a way better launch than dayz and it seems like its gonna be great with allthe crafting you can do. I can see it now in the future with base building rp servers and cars armored up with roof panels. This game gives me the enjoyment of back when i was playing dayz mod origins. And i will continue supporting this game."
-1	 certainly not this."
1	After 10 hours playing this game i can say i like this game reasons:-Graphics 9/10-Survival 9/10-Multiplayer 7/10-action 7/10
1	I love looting towns with my friend and stumbling across chopped up bodies. 10/10 Cannibalism Simulator.also get rekt by the mech
-1	PRO-GOOD SURVIVAL GAME-GOOD CRAFTING AND LOOTING -GRAPHICS-GUN PLAYCONS-ROBOTS JUST REMOVE THEM PLZ-MAP TO BIG FOR 64 PLAYERS NOT ENOUGH ACTION PRETTY DEAD AND BORING-LAGWOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT CURRENT STATE BUT OPINION MAY CHANGE NOTE THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF RELEASE
-1	 zombies are alright but I just overall am super bored.I've been waiting for this game for well over a year and its a let down so far."
-1	Garbo netcode and there's barely anything to do
1	 and a little over-bearing for what I think the game should be6/10 While in betaWorth the price and hopefully gets alot of support."
1	 on the home page i was missing 2 options. not good start"
1	Good game so far :)
1	 dont buy it for a while yet."
-1	-This game is only single player friendly-The map is so large youll never see anyone beside a high pulse and low staminia-Did i mention and puls is totaly stupids?-Game looks great-Gun play seems nice
1	 the better off we'll all be in the long run."
1	 shot me down I had 30% HP left.10. Stop reading and buy this damn game <3"
1	great game :) love the atmosphere! for an early acces its amazing! 1911
-1	 but id really recommend buying something else.. youll be bored or annoyed in no time 4/10"
1	 needs a bit of tuning but overall 8/10."
1	One of the best early access games to hit steam. Devs pushing updates on the regular. If you read this far just buy the game already! :)
1	 and would definatly recommend getting it!!"
-1	very buggy
1	My new favorite survival game
1	 tone them down just a notch.i do enjoy that you have to be smart in bases or get shot to shreds!"
1	 but i'm sure it will be in the future."
-1	"""No items found!""""No items found!""""No items found!""""I'm hungry!""""No items found!""""No items found!""""No items found!""Survival games aren't for me. So i don't recommand if you want to get into action quickly."
1	Currently the best survival game i hope it does get better with the little bugs.(1 MORE THING DONT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS YOU CANT CALL A GAME  TRASH BY PLAYING ONLY 1 HOUR  AND ITS  EARLY ACCESS WHAT DO YOU EXPECT EVERY SURVIVAL GAME HAS BUGS AT FIRST).
-1	 cant even have a fight about it.  Boring."
1	 Rainbow 6 etc. without a problem but this game is just killing my laptop even on the lowest settings. Players are teleporting and there are frame rate issues. Other than performance issues and lag it is a pretty cool concept and has a DayZ feel to it which I like. Buy it if you wanna see it evolve or want to try it out. You shouldn't have a problem if you have a high end pc. This game has some mechanics that makes it different from other survival games and it has potential. It is also really cheap when compared to an unfinished game like DayZ. I personally bought the supporter edition cause I believe in this game."
1	I have to say that the limted time ive had to play this was a blast. Now saying that fix ur severs i cant log on to any severs at all can only play single player. Ive lost all my stuff twice by falling through the map. The desync is horrible and needs so much work. I know this a early access game but with just these 3 things ive been complaining about this game is broke beyond broke. I cant even get my money back at this point and i havent been able to get my moneys worth because all i can play is single player and that sucks
1	 I'd say this Open World Survival EA launch is just over the top better."
-1	it crashes a lot runnins simulater
-1	 had to move the item into a slot in the top just to cut it into rags."
1	Amazing game :)
1	 take a leak and a dump . Keep eye on your health as you roam around. Squad up with your friends for a name above their head at closer distances."
1	The best survival game out there with the best developers.
-1	when i want to create a character i can't press the create button please help !!!
-1	This game is meh for me right now. Walk for a few minutes....get loot....kill....perhaps die..... and again walk and loot and kill... meh
1	Used a shuriken to open my can of chow mein. 10/10
-1	It is like DayZ had a baby......and then took a dump on it
1	 huge potential. Definitely recommend!"
1	Add cars and buildings and this gonna be a good game
1	feels like it starts where DayZ left off...the game needs work but is worth the price
-1	Just terrible.
-1	-Lacking content-FPS is poor-Weather system is poor-Looting is too time consuming -Not enough good loot spawns-Robots ruin the game-Stamina runs out far too quickly-Energy runs out far too quickly
1	 would recommend for people that like a more hardcore experience."
1	 but overall loving the gameplay and gun fights."
1	I play Scum because Im Scum
1	 I suggest you go look up gameplay and see for yourself how you feel because you might be pleasantly suprised.-EDIT: I played on a multiplayer server... yeah I don't see all the whining. I had minor amounts of lag but nothing to terrible."
-1	 for instance they did amazing with the 3rd person (even if it is a total copy from a arma mod). i like the game and what there doing with it i just cant reccomend it atm."
1	pooping on zombies then eating them why not
1	 and the bugs were fixed."
1	 3rd try i found a pick axe and kicked azz on the zombies right away. Or go to the airport it has everything but i did get killed trying to use guns instead of PICKAXE !"
1	 i mean really? even if its 2 hp i still have to bandage before i can even heal -.- way to complex and overly realistic"
1	 dawg- Randy Jackson"
-1	very bare bones runs great not alot to do super clunky UI lot of open land scape with poorly constructed POIs crappiest servers ive seen since pubg literally nothing to do in its current state has a long long way to go hopefully these devs dont abandon it and it becomes something cause its got monster potential but thats all it has is potential at this cureent moment
-1	 next time I find a pair of scissors in a damn microwave I'm going to set off a nuke in that house."
-1	 worse than escape from tarkov! And that's hard to beat.I would really hope they fix stupid issues such as these before any vehicles are rolling around causing more laggy issues."
-1	 just...... Wait...."
-1	 this game is for you."
1	 I really enjoy the vibe (its already better than Dayz.) 6.5/10"
1	Yee not bad aye
1	 me and my friends have been having a great time playing together and we are very excited to buy it as an early access and see where how much potential this game has."
-1	this game is garbage just a money grab would rather play h1z1 thats how bad this game is
1	 there are bugs but that is to be expected with a brand new EA Game. I'm loving it so far!"
-1	 etc.   im sure it will be much better in a year or so"
1	Haha all the negative reviews from people with >2 Hours on the game. EA = Dont play if you can't handle the heat brah
1	 as first is was abit overwhelming but when you get yourself set up its amazing. Has a few issues which is expected as its early access with lag and when it kicks you off but when its happened to me its loaded back up in a minute or two."
1	needs alot of opimization done and performence issuses but over all good game and lots of server lag
-1	The game is just boring ! maybe it's good maybe bad idk it's just not my cup of tea! i got in looted for a long time then got killed then respawned with no loot looted again then got killed idk what's the point of the game there is absolutly no goal! I guess im refunding
1	 the overrall gameplay is great."
1	So far so good. If you liked Day Z I would seriously recommend picking this up. Only issue I have had so far is some optimization issues. Occasionally I will drop down to 40Fps from 60. This is on Medium Settings with a 1060 and Ryzen 3 1200. Will update review when I have more time with game.
1	Beware the big scary robots their mean
-1	 I get 1 fps if i walk into a town and I hold when punching unrealistic scum worst game"
1	It's chill. Fixed my server. Just did a poo on it.
-1	5/10Scum is quite litteraly scum.  You have to run for 30 minutes to get back to your body if you die most times and the lag is unmanagable.  Every fire fight is a joke because people are skipping across the screen.  I wish I would have returned this before reaching 2 hours of play time.
-1	 play a better game called 7 days to die. getting a refund."
1	Ignore all these scumbags complaining about a fun and functional day one early access game.
1	 and a lot to work with. The depth of the game is actually surprising . There are shurikens."
-1	no search bar for servers?!!?!?!? CANCER
1	 Crafting feels good great game so far.."
1	RIP DAYZgame has already had 2 updates in 2 days!!need to fix memory leak lags spikes are so bad
1	Really enjoying the game only thing i think is not really cool is that the giant robots will blast you on sight but they are friends with the zombies doesnt really make sense
-1	Why would you not put a search bar for the servers? Wasted 30 minutes trying to find the server my buddies are on and i still cant find it. Pretty ridiculous oversight if you ask me.
-1	 then suddenly while being in the middle of the Airfield i got all my gear wiped away while still being chased by muppets. As long as stuff like that happens i cannot recommend this game. Still has alot of potential."
-1	game is just about sitting in a corner in a base and camp. even if you have been in a base for 20min there is a guy in a room with closed doors and is waiting for you. who has the time to do nothing but staring at a door for 20min? players that like this game. concept of the game would be great tho. but it's just not fun at all.
-1	The melee system is garbage. Its a laggy mess. You literaly could just stand there punching the person in the face and game wont register the hits.
1	Love the game even though it needs improvements. Would reccomend to a friend. Can't wait for the updates!! Buy it now!!
-1	crap
1	Game is awesome but need more guns! For example MG's M4's and women character.
1	 running quite well for an alpha game and graphics are quite good."
1	i can see that this game is the door to all future survival games ...its a new way to survive!! as long as the devs keep updates and contents and as long as the base building is a priority to develope i think the game will reach the famous ARK:survival evolved or maybe do more than it .. keep up devs :)
1	 with nice graphics and sounds!Buy it and have fun!"
1	 not like others out there."
-1	Crap factory.
-1	 so if you loot real good a lagging russian player can easily kill you with a freaking crowbar no matters if you rain your bullets on him it not registers bc of lags and bugs of this game and that ruins fun of the game."
1	 i will give 10/10"
1	If your disappointed with DayZ? Get this game ASAP wayyyyyy better!
-1	To many cheaters / too many hacks
-1	 that was cool for about 10 minutes before they were bored and wanted to pubg or something else. I think the game would be better with half or more of the map removed."
1	more than worth its price
-1	 and thats pretty f-ing bad."
1	You can eat people. 10/10
1	 but i do not mind them just lower some settings and game still looks amazing. Sometimes i stop doing what i should do on this game and i just look at the details"
1	 best early access game in a long time. Think DayZ + H1Z1 + real life."
1	 we can finally lay her to rest.                         Rest. In. Peace.                                DayZ    December 13 2013-August 29 2018"
1	 then you will like this game."
1	Developers
1	I've become a health nutrition professional. Thanks SCUM
1	 Sorry Rust... you lost.  Scum rules.  Dev's keep up the great work and add some wheels to the server's soon please. :)"
1	 stable and immersive. There are a lot of things that need to be improved but so far it's going in the right way and it's worth the current price tag."
1	 10/10"
1	 and these guys come across as meaning business."""
1	 looking forward to base building"
-1	what a crap of  a game!! there are dozens of games similar and better!! what a waste of time!!
-1	Ok so there is a few major problems with this game that i feel like everyone should be aware of. there is a major memory leak you can only play for an hour or 2 without your frames going to 10 and you needing to reopen the game. along with the looting system wich is also broken you can only find weapons and ammo that are usefull in military bases. that are overun with players since there is only like 15 of them and 64 players in a server so there is never any loot in the bases and if there is good luck getting past the mechs that can snipe you down even if they see so much as a toenail off your body. so as of right now i would deffinetly not reccomend this game to anyone. buy a game like miscreated were atleast the looting works and the map is overun with loot in any type of house.
1	 unlike other EA titles."
1	 but its overall a great game with a great dev team. 9/10"
1	 you can get acceptable FPS ( in my case acceptable is 75 fps ) on lower end PC ( like mine ). The game has a enough content to enjoy for many hours. The price tag is perfect.8.7/10 for me."
1	 but i'm sure it will reach 8 and 9 as time goes by."
1	Could use some more bones.
1	 glitches and everything else that has to do with EA games.I'm enjoying my time playing and I think you should pick this up and try it out yourself..Buy this and come kill me in game like everyone else does :\"
1	 keep growing this little gem."
1	ALL NAGITIVE REVIEWS COME FROM DAYZ PLAYERS WORRIED THIS IS GONNA KILL DAYZGREAT GAME GREAT PRICELOTS TO DORIP DAYZ
-1	 i had a fight with a guy axe vs baseball bat we fought for 10 mins then laughed about the desync cause we couldnt hit eachother....hope the best for this game but as SO MANY EARLY ACCESS GAMES ITS NEVER READY FOR RELEASE !!!......"
1	 what can you expect. Buy this game now."
1	 stop whining about it until we see what this game and the devs are really capable of.  I'm pretty impressed by what I'm seeing so far."
1	Diarrhea is awesome 10/10
1	 had plenty of fun on the first day of early access"
-1	 game is actual dog sh**"
-1	 though."
-1	;;;''';';oikyugjuhhmgvhmvg
-1	dayz remake lol
-1	I'd wait a bit
1	SCUM looks really beautiful and runs very good even though it's an early access game. I hope the dev team make SCUM a game that DayZ couldn't be and add the content they promised they would add. Check it out when it's still 20 bucks because it's really worth it.
1	"iv had no issues with this game no low fps no issues finding loot if you just look at what you are doing and give the single player a go before jumping in to online you will be fine it matters what ""skills"" you give yourself at the start take your time to try new set out and see what works for you."
1	Nice.
1	jebacka igra
1	Good game and dev
1	 scenery looks great.   Character models are ok but limited so im guessing there will either be a lot of paid for DLC to get away from generic which is already seen in the first release.  Maps are large and right now with max 66 people in a server there is little action until you reach the main towns or robot controlled areas.. the zombies are easily by passed or killed if your bored and the robots are really dumb machines.Its EA and looks like it will need a lot of fleshing out on the game mechanics side.  Controls tend to be standard although the initial bind on sprinting for some reason wa done on the mouse scroll wheel...go figure... but you can change it... havent run into any major issues or bugs ...oh and stay away from goats .. if you hear it bleat...run they are more deadly than any robot in the game..."
-1	cheaters cheaters cheaters
-1	 but it's just a generic survival game right now. No fun."
1	it will be even better"
-1	hmm where to start well the game ran like garbage figured ok its on epic turned it down to low graohics and still every time i turn the slightest bit everything freezes and nothing changes and this is in a single player match i got to get customer support and get taken to something that supposed to have a customer support website specifically for this game but when i click it i dont see the word support or anything close that could be support in it i mean honestly did yall do anything with this before you throw it out making people pay for this crap
1	"walked for about 5 minutes and found some clothes.... walked for about another 10 minutes and found a fence... walked along the fence and then heard ""Target Aquired"" in a deep robotic voice and then was instantly shot and killed.... 12/10 still better than dayz."
-1	 this game should not be 1 Million times more confusing. 5/10 I do not reccomend this game until information and gameplay is much easier to grapple with. It really couldnt hurt having some official efforts being put into explaining just what to do."
1	 and seem really dedicated to it."
1	Love it! You need time for this game and idealy a friend. Ultra realistic and much better version of DayZ in my opiinion. Great game
1	This is by far the best survival game I have had the pleasure of playing. This game is extremely well thought out and the depth of the character traits are just amazing. This is truly the perfect imersive role playing game.
1	 and buy it."
-1	 but again if that's your game this would be a good fit and worth a try."
1	 but can they be killed. or disabled? idk great game 9.8/10 recommend. doing amazing so far!!"
-1	broken server list wouldnt show up dont buy until fixed
-1	 game needs an actual anti cheat and soon. I highly reccomend against getting this until the anti cheat is implemented."
1	good game combat is a bit dodgy hope they fix it
-1	was cool for the first couple hours same ol same survival game. yall got along way to go good luck.id recommend it if your into early access survivals.
1	Had explosive diarrhea 10 feet from a bear....                          ...... it didnt end well.
1	 health system and crafting. Great for groups!"
-1	Utter garbage game.
1	there're bugs and glitches cuz the game is still in Early Acess."
1	 everything is built solid. Like a not garbage version of dayz."
-1	 in its current state."
-1	it took me over an hour to get close to meeting my friend in game just to die from a random guy. To then just re-spawn all the way across the map form him again. Its not a survival game its a running simulater game.
1	 the world looks beautiful even on low settings and in 10 hours I haven't run into any major bugs yet. Definitley worth the price!"
1	 and would reccomend this game to all who love survival and looting."
-1	 and beef up the events."
1	Its like being a homeless guy in chicago.
1	 devs spoke of this.  Netcode.  This is the biggest one that I imagine will be the most difficult to solve.  Once this is fixed it will make the current PVP actually interesting."
-1	 if you purchase this game be prepared to run around in forests with nothing while getting attacked by zombies and other robots. Strongly would NOT recommend. EXTREMELY BORING."
-1	just more early access garbage
-1	my gtx 460 from 7 years which i paid $400 dollars for cant run the game! unbeleiveable. typical early access devs not optimazing their game
1	 realistic prison simulator 10/10"
1	 and very few games can say this.for this alone i reccomend the game.BUT ALSO-20$ is pretty fair price- game runs reasonably well for EA on i5/gtx970/8gb ram (average 30+fps with graphics set on highest settings)-Game seems to have many mechanics to discover and tweak out on-looks pretty dope"
1	 or tasks to complete to help get started."
1	 way more stuff to do and more hardcore. Has been out for 2 days and it runs better than DayZ. I love the game"
1	Better verison of dayZ. (for now)
1	 the world itself looks amazing. The fact that we got both zombies and assault Mech is also very cool. The Mech can be a bit buggy when they detect you through walls but they will probably fix this. I frankly don't think of much downsides even if the game is only early access. The future of this game looks quite bright."
1	 then its a no brainer!"
1	games is gold for an ea game it is better than i was expecting an the devs are rolling out patches an crushing bugz as they go
1	 cause I quite enjoy it once you've passed the boring parts of the game."
1	 see you on the island."
-1	 but that's like saying you're the smartest kid with down syndrome."
1	 and note the date of reviews prior and following my review.  9/3/18"
1	 specially if you play with friends."
1	 SCUM could go a long way and truely be something special or be cast aside to an ever growing backlog of survival shooters. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1	Great for only 1 week in EA
1	 wait until it gets better."
1	 if that's not your type of game then look elsewhere."
1	 especially for such early access.  Dev's are very quick to fix issues as well as update and release new content.  Can't ask for more from an early access survival game!"
1	Like dayz but better executed
-1	 then OK."
-1	Has potential. Would not recommend right now.
-1	 this is bulshit.DO NOT BUY."
1	ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE! GET IT WHILE ITS EARLY AND EXPERIENCE IT FROM THE START TO FINISH!!!!!!
-1	 but at this time there is literaly nothing to do but loot the same stuff and pvp... and the only thing about that is people with crap connection stutter so it makes close combat ridiculous ... maybe it will get better soon"
-1	 oh yea...and BORING!!!"
1	 this should be THE BEST SURVIVAL GAME to ever be released."
1	 but the devs were quick to fix these issues and I have had nothing but great gameplay since. The events are truly awesome and a cool way to get better at pvp and test the end game guns without fearing losing items. From an old rust player this game truly delivers and will only get better with time!"
-1	"Annoying walking simulator. it's just running from town to town just to find that the whole thing has been looted. All while being constantly annoyed by the ""dynamic"" metabolic system."
-1	 Fix the net code."
-1	 see and use their body parts and whatever materials they had on them. I'm just writing this comment for anyone like myself who simply doesn't enjoy this degree of violence in my game."
1	awesome game very realistic!!!
1	 but hope performance is the largest focus of the dev team for all of the beta/full release.  Stability will always trump features with the game beings as fleshed out as it is now."
1	Need more optimisation for low end pcs
-1	Not playable. Do not buy.
-1	"Walking Simmulator ""It was great I walked for like a hour than got shot down by a Security Guard"" .10/10"
1	 the game has a solid foundation."
1	 to buy stuff from other players or from a vending machine or somewhere.5."
1	The survival game we have all been waiting for! Lots of hours in already and loving every bit of it. If you guys need any help with feedback or testing message me.
1	A great potential usually implies a great potential for this or that.
1	 its alredy better than most survival games and it can get better!"
1	 try to forget about my last review."
-1	 way to unplayable. Will look again into it after a year. Gona get a refund"
1	 10/10 definetly would crash friendship again"
1	 i really don't understand who not recommend this game"
1	 i dont get why people are expecting more and giving it bad reviews."
1	I m starting to love this game. It was a rocky start the first hour of gameplay but it's getting better. Graphics are amazing good gameplay. Money well spent!!!
-1	 other than to wait."
1	poggers
1	 it's been out for less than 12 hours and people are complaining. Send help"
1	cheap
-1	Why can't I Thank the bus driver? WTF
1	 maybe I already did!-The movement feels amazing-Inventory feels nicely aranged and fairly easy to learn-Crafting makes sense with the required skills.-Shooting feels alright after getting used to it!-Melee feels quite goodConclusion: this game just came out today so there are gonna be many fixes and updates.... at the current state I think this game is about a 6-10. (Just the server fix would make it a 7 xD )"
-1	 so bad. :("
1	GIVE IT TIME
1	 SCUM is gunning for you."
1	fix your connection bugs fast and fix your damage dealer you take to much damage for nothing i lost 40 health for jumping down from a shelther. but besides that its a fun game and i recommed it
1	 sweeping each corner expecting to see them waiting for you. SCUM is amazing. I will never not advocate for people to play it."
-1	Feed your fat avatar-single player edition
-1	 its quite difficult to look around with the pitchblack screen with the probability of getting killed by zombies or robots. ( which happened to me soon after ) I guess the game has a long way to go and might be better of played by casual players like me once its already ready. ( game takes up a HUGE amount of time. ) Note: I refunded my game till they further show improvements within the game."
1	Very fun game. The metabolism system is much simpler than it appears. Definitely reccomend for fans of survival games.
1	 but mega depressing with them cheaters sometimes"
-1	 just asked a refund. Its unplayable."
1	 I recommend you to join Discord community which can help you a lot at the beginning of your Scum journey."
1	Obama standing with his arms folded and smiling
-1	 this is crap. How can a game be good if I can't even experience it?"
1	SCUM FULL OF GLITCHES https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantPlayfulSalmonTBTacoRight
-1	 which is probably their whole plan anyway. Definitely better games out there - this game isnt worth 20 bucks in my opinion."
1	Hardcore but so much fun good game for any survival collection.
1	 but it will be a great game if the developers listen to the community."
-1	 it is a laggy mess with horrible desync. I would wait a few months or so before i buy it again after my refund."
1	 its way under priced."
1	its improving
1	 but it's just great. The mechanicsa are on point and the game has minimal to no visible bugs. I would be very happy to see more performance optimizations though. overall this game was a great buy for just 8.19 USD. I would definately reccomend this to a friend. Also it would be great if you would work on adding vehicles because of the rediculously huge map lol."
1	 thanks for the game."
1	 well detailed game that has a long way to go before I can play without worrying about rage quitting and never returning."
-1	why i don't see any server game??. just single player?
-1	 Has a good feel to it but the crafting system sucks sooooo bad and the entire game is based around the crafting system . Dont waste your money until they change the crafting system."
1	 i give this a 10 out of 10. Hopefully they keep improving and make this the best survival game."
-1	 who actually asked for this game?"
-1	 will maybe try it out later down the development cycle."
-1	 but once they release the game (if that happens) I might change my review."
1	SCUM >DAYZ SA
1	 can't wait to see this game in full release!"
-1	Game first was amazing......Now its walk around loot and wipe simulator... do not play this game...until they stop wiping....KYS scum devs PS hopping onto dayz right now 10/10 gameplay right there...only took them 5 years tho
-1	nope I couldnt recommend this game yet."
-1	 switch to the other and spray the 2nd 30 rounds into him again... Just runs right up to me punches me once insta killing me... There are hackers every in this game... If you die its probaly due to a hacker... What a waste of money."
-1	Waste of money. boring as hell.
1	 I was apprecative that there was singleplayer added."
1	The devs are quick to respond with community concerns and questions. They have also been extremely active with addressing isues and concerns. My only issue was with the no anti cheat and that had been addressed with the recent update. Would recommend this game. It is the survival game we deserve.
-1	Really dissappoting to be honest hunger level kills me more times then players and i have to poop every 4 seconds -10/10000 would not recommend
1	 comeback in one year maybe ! atm they need to fix servers then memory leak cause it's bothering most of the players. better anti-cheat functions too. losts of hackers are growing. still i can say it worth it and I recommend every one to have this game in their library. 7/10 Optimize FPS"
1	 so be advised if you don't want to autistically micromanage how many carbs your character is taking in."
1	 but I likeeeeeee this :D"
-1	Terrible. Nice concept. Atrocious attempt at creating a game. Good try but you obviously paid streamers to hype the game up.
1	 pick it up asap and grab some friends to play with as it definetly is more enjoyable with your pals. :)"
1	 it's better than DayZ"
1	Only played for a bit but love it! cant wait for more updates!
-1	 also boring"
-1	 but theres gonna have to be a lot more features to keep me interested in this game."
1	 or the servers about to restart."
-1	 and have a product you'll actually want to play without getting frustrated at the bugginess of it all"
-1	 cannot find any way to change and I dont want to risk loosing the ability to refund if I cant play the darn thing."
1	Best survival game with so much continued potential.  Anyone who enjoyed dayz will love this game!
1	this game is something i hae been waiting for for a veary long time it has its bugs  its beta its 20 bucks you can tell the devs realy care aboat this game  it just screams diffrent its pubg and dayz in one game you can be in free node like dayz and loot up and stuff and if u get bord you can jump into a free for all its many things in one and for that scum 10/10 from me  push updats and fix severs and people will talk aboat this game years from now
1	 and surving are what I look forward to in the game. Hopefully in a few updates the pvp will be fixed."
1	This is dope
1	SUCKS. CANT QUE UP WITH HOMIES. HORRIBLE CONNECTION. BAD GAMEPLAY
1	 and the list goes on... Great jobs guys! 10/10..This game has great potential! I would recommend it to anyone that were to ask me. I'd say lets give them some more time and see how responsive they are to fix the issues as they start to show up ingame and also bring us more content. Im looking forward to spending countless hours enjoying SCUM!!"
-1	 I would suggest to wait it out until issues are fixed."
-1	 especially optimization so the game is more playable to a wider audiance of gamers. However the game is still early access so i reckon this game could be huge later on this year. I acctually played the game and had to refund..."
-1	 then theres a 0.1% chance of actually finding it."
-1	 but if they can't look past ""the vision"" of their game.... nope... just nope... plenty of other things to play."
-1	No.Tried to play in 2160p and got 25fps on average.Tried to lower all of the graphics settings to the lowest possibile value and got 32fps on average.Tried to lower ingame resolution to 1080p and was greeted with an ingame window in the upper left portion of my UHD monitor because thanks to DX11 Unreal Engine cannot do exclusive fullsceen.Will i reduce my desktop resolution to 1080p in order to play this game with more than console peasant framerates? Absolutely not.Refunded and done for.Hardware used:Core i7 6700k @ 4.5GHzZotac GTX 1080 AMP!16GB DDR4-3200
-1	it wery bad gam
-1	Rent a server??????what a joke
1	 I like it and will spend most of my time on this game for awhile."
1	I took a poop from 1000m 10/10 would play again
1	 but it can be ""fixed"" with a memory cleaner program. (At least in my case it has worked up to some extent).Obviously the best part about the game is the fact that you can literally defecate on people you kill."
1	 pick it up and start surviving. Happy Hunting!"
1	 devs constantly updating"
1	good
-1	 a lot needs to be changed for it to be worth the price."
-1	 very early access lot of work needs to be done."
1	 and I'll never stop playing yours if you keep this up."
1	 food/drink and sickness. Also the event mode and map are excellent."
1	i love this game but im dying cuz i cnat cut my fkin clothes into rags for some reason so im loosing hp.... plzzz help
1	 a the sound of the drops on the leaves during a thunderstorm. (the tracks of our shoes in the mud too (just a decal to add with a fade out)))"
-1	 that's funnier than this game."
1	Loving this game. Playing it with a squad of mates and it's a real good laugh. Some small niggly annoyances but that's to be expected from an early access game. Looking forwards to more updates and maybe some form of transport.  :)
-1	yet another early access game that will never be finished.
-1	 I will spend much more time playing this game and I look forward to the future that the devs might bring to it BUT I believe that the game will be worth playing in a few months and not just now.I look forward to changing my review in a few months!"
1	 i love it"
-1	I just wish i had only played 2 hours..........
-1	It will take some time to make this game even playable xD
1	my only gripe - lack of FOV slider
1	 and what we deserved.Can only go up from here."
1	Best survival game ever
1	 let's see if i'll keep it this way in some weeks/mounths."
1	Great game
1	this game is nice and all but the pvp is just awful popravite to ljudi vam prestaju igra
1	 but I can still run the game with low to mid settings and I can't complain. I'm actually amazed my laptop could run this game even if it's still on early access. :DI hope the game developers deliver a great final product and still add features for this game. I also hope I could still run the game when 1.0 comes. :)"
1	good game for that price.
1	 just trying to stay alive. Cant wait to see how the progress on dev is."
-1	 refund request sent out."
1	After 3 attempt I made my way to airfield. Killed two guy with my handgun and made some tricks. I started to loot. I made myself as badass as soldiers and I died from falling. F*** you Newton
1	I say: DA!
1	 PICK THIS UP"
1	 lots of fun playing in a group has alot of potential I would recommend this game gonna get many hours on it"
1	 and Croteam have my utmost respect and confidence."
1	 and potential."
1	fun and indepth survival game
-1	 this is the game for you. SCUM = looting/ running simulator 3/10 removed from my PC"
1	The timer needs a cap as god knows how long it goes up to and ive had to re-start several servers now so that is shocking especcially when i get killed as a fresh spawn like shouldnt their be a penalty for that? overall the survival aspect is good but the respawn timer isnt needed!
1	The Mechs haunt my dreams
1	. but not because it does anything different only because it has a decent player base atm to kill. otherwise its pretty standard."
1	 but it seems it could be so much better with a squad or a duo. I am going to recommend this game since the low price is worth a buy even at this early stage. 7/10"
1	 the row doesn't keep the selection. It's impossible to search. You need to fix that."
1	 go ahead and go have a blast because SCUM does a lot of things right. Do not let the mixed reviews throw you off. Enjoy!"
-1	Optimize for the love of God. Even with FPS fixes and custom launch paramaters the game plays terribly. Not worth money at this point.
1	uuuuuuuuuuuuuuf its so goood
1	More ambitious then most games of it's genre especially at this point in the games development. Seems to have a good potential to be a great game.
1	 you can also kill your enemies and make them munch on your scat.Overall 5/5 very optimistic about the game's direction."
1	 because there are many."
1	It's better than dayz thats for sure.
-1	 feels like a real slap in the face to their fanbase."
1	 very fun. Devs actively update the game and are active in the Reddit community /rSCUMgame. Steam community sucks assss"
1	 unlike dayz where you feel as if you are fighting with the clunkyness and controls this game feels good to play. i find myself enjoying surviving and fighting the Zeds insted of me just ignoring those aspects and runninng around untill i find someone too kill. I enjoy the game inbeetween PVP confrontations which is key to this kind of game being sucsessful.Once optimized combined with a good RP server i can seem myself sinking alot of hours into this game"
1	very noice game
1	- starts game- plays hours and gets geared up- falls through the map- appears 15 meters in the air- falls to death- spends 30 minutes trying to find the body- it disappeared10/10 would waste hours again
1	 but optimization its so bad"
1	 we being the community.We need base building. and some people will say ""ohh but you can build boxes and you will be able to fortify houses"". No we have a huge map why not fill it up with some cool bases like h1z1 or miscreated? it will give us a goal in the game not just running around endlessly. We also need some mode of transport. right now it takes too long to get to your friend or to get to places.. It just gets so boring..."
1	 it ate so much RAM that this game will put Chrome into shame."
1	f.....ng awesome
1	 very challenging and great for squads!"
1	 cassette loaded games that took longer to load than your average MP match to HD heaven ;-)"
1	 which is the final judgement criteria for this player."
-1	disappointing just like dayz
1	Good init
1	over the steaks; so now you've got 50 steaks with any of them divided into three portions and 50 pieces of fat multiplied for 10 portions each.Don't waste food: only hunt deers when you are playing in group and every one of you is really really hungry.If you are alone just focus on an isolated zombe and cook some delicious human steaks."
-1	 sort of. It will intermittently freeze during combat though and you will be dead when it sorts itself out.TL;DR: Don't buy unless you have 16gb+ RAM"
-1	game for me is just a copy of dayz plays the same the crafting system is bad ... lags like hell in places may get better but for me its jus a worse Dayz
1	Awesome game but much runing.I hope vehicles comes fast in this game.
1	 die. Repeat."
1	fun game actually
-1	 map is very large it takes a while to move from a section to another lots of frame drops(Evga Gforce Gtx 1080Ti SC2) Also would like to mention the controlls are not correct"
1	 it is early acess. And i have had a few issues. When i go to big Places. I have low frame rate even though my pc meets requirements. So idk if other people have this issue. But im gonna say its definetly worth buying."
-1	Game crashes every single time you try to refresh the server Page
-1	Refunded for the fact that optimisation is bad and it isn't enjoyable on my rig. When more updates come out im sure i will re invest into the game.
1	 gameplay is awesome!"
1	 this game is a deal. 20 bucks for a game in EA that actually works well. Definitely a great game and a refreshing take on the genre."
1	 the devs do care and lsiten they updated the came with a patch in less then 6 hours when they heared about the connection errors . Can't wait for further updates"
1	 shelter options. Great work devs and very responsive to community!"
1	 occasional drops when entering towns but leveled off again."
1	The basic features of this game are solid. Looking forward to addtional content coming out.Haven't had any server connection issues since launch day.
-1	 will check it out in a year."
1	I promised the Dev that if he banned me from the discord I would change my review to positive
1	 if ur not the guy that cant just like the game for what it is you should probably wait a couple weeks for them to push out an update."
1	 It just came out but the limit as to what it can become is the sky"
1	 what other game lets you take a dump on a mattress?"
1	 I can't wait to see what the devs add or expand i hope this game develops into a very in depth but good survial game."
-1	I want to love this game because it has potential to grow and it is not as bad as dayz but the fame point system is not very good and the loot distributionis is not very good plus you have a respawn time with low fame points 4/10
1	Good magic stuff.
1	 and FPS issues than I've seen with many other EA games lately.  9/10"
1	Great game loads of features at early access launch well worth the monies
1	 however a patch has come out that hopefully has fixed this issue but as of writing this review I have yet to try it. I fully believe in the dev team that this will be fixed either in this current patch or in the next few patches as so far they've done nothing but prove they're working on sorting these issues out as a matter of urgency.1-2-3-4-5-6-[7]-8-9-10OverallBrilliant early access title that's cheap and does what it says on the tin with hard working devs that are bringing new ideas to a genre that has been filled with awful let downs.Worth buying if you enjoy a great survival experiance. I could write more but I have ran out of space!1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-[9]-10"
-1	This game so far is very good but there is one thing that makes me not recomend it. and that's the state the PVP is in right now. You can get in a fist fight with somebody and he is teleporting around and you have to bassicaly guess where he is going to be. Fix this then the game will be worth 20$
1	the game is awesome and the servers are getting fixed
-1	24fps on a 1080ti? seems like a good game too.
1	 good game."
1	11/10 <3
1	Loved the game its something diffrent and its a lot of fun realistic features such as needing to take a sh*t diffrent aproaches to character such as character biulds etc everyone can play how they want to and fit their play style great game looking foward for upcoming updates so far its great as of release. (servers are a bit lagy but first day lauch + server overload due to players)
1	 Great game considering its only just been releasedThings needed before the game is perfect:-V-SYNC!-Vehicles-Base Building-Server + Bug Fixes"
1	I spent 45 mins trying to find out how to pee.10/10 realism.
-1	 the problem might be that i have a laptop card ( nvidia 770m ) and the game isnt optimized for laptops as of yet."
1	So far so good. I hope it will not end up like many other EA titles.
-1	 proper base building and maybe some form of missions (as well as general game optimization)."
1	 and you can always refund it if you don't like it."
-1	Constant 30-40 fps with everything on LOW using a GTX 970 OC.. This is indeed a real shame for UE4.
-1	 just get that and it is this in a nutshell.Complete and utter junk.Uninstalled already waste of money!!"
-1	Servers are laggy af
-1	hahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhaa stop defending this dayz fanboys
1	 just watch out.  8/10"
-1	 enemies disappear out of sight when trying to aim at them while they are behind object/ running inside a structure ?in first person."
-1	 but for now it isn't"
1	 however melee is still buggy agains both persons and zombies. Expected for an Early access game"
1	Kill pig. Cook pig. Become pig.
-1	 but today it's not. Pass on this one if you're unsure."
1	 but you might."
1	dont even buy it.for those who like survival game this is a very good investment.visualy its awesome w/o lags.devs are active fixing issues as fast as they can."
-1	 wait for it to be on sale."
1	 the dev team is amazing and are currently pushing patches out left and right. Well worth the money already."
-1	 and the only thing left for me to do was leave this review. If a dev reads this and would like to push through my refund that'd be great."
1	Good
-1	Gameplay is great but zombies are horrible legit u can't even hit back ur speed to attack with ur fists or a weapon is too slow so u can't get away and you lock onto the zombie so u can't move anywhere so the zombie always wins
-1	This games anti cheat is 100% bugged i recieved a ban the only software i was running was memcleaner since my pc is not that great and this game has some memory leak. I am assuming that this caused the anti-cheat to flag my account. of course when you try to appeal you get a copy pasted reply from easy anti-cheat about your false ban GG bought 2x accounts with supporter packs and both of them got banned now. What a joke
-1	 non stop. lol"
-1	the game is absoulte dog sh*te haha there is just nothing to do in it
1	 let's just hope the devs don't get lazy with it being a top 5 seller and neglet to fix the very pressing issues with it in EA."
1	Best EA game that has came out in a long time.
1	 there are many planned features and fixes on the way.See you. ^^"
1	 but they're not spammed across the map and you can avoid them if you're patient and use stealth. The BCU monitor is also really fantastic. I actually made my skinny character fat after hunting the bear and eating all those bear stakes. So now I'm on weight watchers. Shout out to the devs as well. They are EXTREMELY responsive and they react quickly. In the first hour the servers crashed a lot (if you didn't expect that you have NOT been playing games for very long) but maybe an hour or two after release the devs already released an update that fixed the problem for me. I didn't have a single crash in 7 hours of playing. If you like survival games then this is the game for you. Thank you CroTeam for bringing this amazing adventure to us and letting us experience your world."
1	 this game is on the right path for early acces day 1. Keep it up! Dont listen to the Negative reviews. Game is worth playing."
-1	Waste.
1	 this is definitely worth the 20 bucks."
1	 but now I feel 17EU is quite cheap for the experience you get in this game."
-1	Poor optimization
-1	This would have been better if it came out when DayZ was popular.  Now it just feels outdated and it is new.
1	Its fun !!
-1	 No thanks"
-1	 but to release at this stage with the tiny amount of content it has. SHame. I expect this game will be a far better purchase in the following months. Cannot recommend to buy at the moment however."
1	 If your unsure though wait untill its further developed. Its also made by a pretty good developer that puts heart into a game."
-1	 i so want this game to be fun but its not quite there yet"
1	The Dayz killer.  Don't @ me Dayz fan boys.
1	 and if not this will just be your typical survival game."
1	+Multiplayer servers run well with 64 people+Easy to learn crafting system+A LOT of features+Good amount of loot+You can enter any building-Low fps( but steady )
-1	There is a typo in game name
1	Fun game and well done for a Day 1 EA game.  IMO it is already 10x better than DayZ was and this is just Day 1.  Looking forward to seeing the improvements.
1	 is a great way to prevent people from just stacking up on meat when they have attained guns as all nutrients/ foodtypes are tracked. Most people I have run into are friendly since no one knows how to play well. The farthest along ""early access"" game I have ever played. Worth 20$ 3 times over. And there is more to come !!!"
1	Best survival game 2018.... best game 2018... just the best game... ever. cant describe better than thatjoin the server! 172.107.16.231:28102
1	 im confident you won't have to refund as long as you love hardcore survival games."
1	This is a great survival game which is doing very well for early access. So many things extremely well done. Will only get better. Highly Recomend to those considering.
1	mostly Good overall performancelooks goodplays goodperformance is gooda lot of featuresBUTVery anoying short freezes and lagsthat cost me my life multiple timesStill Great Game and i will recommend it since its cheap and its just released and the dev are Fun
1	 the game looks great and is fairly optimized already. I'm happy to give these people 20 dollars and see what they can do to this title in a year. I would personally prefer a heavier lean towards hardcore survival than what already exists but I'm happy to give these people money and time to flesh this game out and make it great."
1	 or be able to add them to a friends list and party without having to run all the way to them just add them and to be able to see their name above there head for 50 meters. Overall great game and will only get better. My main concern is that transport and base updates will take months to roll out  by which time the game will have lost its hype and have less attention than it will deserve."
1	 and I will : )"
1	 and the flying guard robots are annoying in good side :) 9.7/10 survival game"

1	 and with a brighter future ! LOVE IT"
-1	 with a little physics thrown in there."
-1	entirely unplayable in its current state. i'll reinstall and try again in 3 months.
-1	 would not buy YET"
-1	 took me an hour of looting an entire town just to find a stick of butter and a lighter. If they fixed the performance and actually added stuff to do besides kill other players it would be fine"
-1	40 Hits with a Slaughter knife < 4 Hits ShovelBroken game ...
1	 but you still find plenty of gear in other spots."
1	SCUM is an early access survival game that I've been following since december of 2017. It got delayed about 100000 times so when it came out my hype was at about 8/10 I'm still hype for the game and I think that the second they get base building and vehicles into the game It'll be greatFinal vertic: 6/10 can't find anyone to murder also the proximity voice chat is wionky af no matter where you are when people talks it sounds like they're in your ear
1	 buy and play :-)"
1	 which is to be expected. But I am confident this will be a fantastic game in due time.Best of Luck Devs!"
1	 and of course compete with other player to get that loots just like PUBG.They have to fixed the voice chat in game.. sometimes i can;;;t hear clearrly other player when they speak."
1	This Game Has Bright Future!!!It Will Become A Masterpiece!
1	 ive had some great fun with firends and solo so far and i sincerely wish them the best of luck with all future plans/updates for SCUM and i will be ambitiously awaiting to see what they have in store. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1	 with zombies.only 2 issues aside from bugs i've seen that make it suuuper boring.1. need a faster way to get around the map soon as running from place to place is boring.2. the map is amazingly big but creates the issue of never seeing players soooo looting is made useless for the most part."
1	 i totaly recomment this game to anybody that is a fan of survival games this is the dogs doolies... :)"
1	 which will be exciting to witness and enjoy.Get in early now and git gud."
1	10/10 Best skat action outside of Germany. Would defo poop on friends face again.
1	very realistic and fun to play. Gets a little boring at some point but i enjoy this game anyways. Multiplayer recommended. Singlplayer isnt that fun to play. Cant wait to see this game in full release.
1	 I usually find myself walking through the forest eating mushrooms and watching the sun filter through the trees. Oh and my friend shot my other friend in the face with a shotgun. That was Alsace-Lorraine pretty awesome."
1	 but im here for $20"
-1	And how do you request a refund again?
1	Running Simulator 2.0 Stamina Edition
1	This has got to be the best game out there so far its a WAY better game then DayZ it takes the idea and makes it better you can find loot anywhere and the game is full of hours.
1	 like any early access game.... get it while it's only 19.99!!!!"
1	 tireless and is supporting the community and it's ideas - almost every other developer out there could take something from this approach. Over the moon with my purchase!"
1	had almost 80 hours in one and a half week... a bit boring if you can't figure out what to do but just suicide and start from scratch again... that's what i do for now and i'm not getting tired of it!
-1	dumbest game ever stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-1	 guns that can one shoot you ! Don't freez on me every time someone else shoots at me. This is unplayable at it's current state i recomend waiting for a better version before buying this.P.S:This was my dream game .... such a shame."
-1	 I cannot recommend"
1	Early Access game.. Still has time to improve
-1	gtx 105016 gb ddr4i5 6500ssd~ 30fps on lowest settings possible :(
1	 but with this price I won't refund it as I like to see this kind of progress in the video game industry and would back it up with this price anyway."
1	10/10 would take a wee on my friend while he's looting again.
-1	I'll come back when it's better. bye for now
-1	I know the game is in early access but when a game is in early access that means it's atleast PLAYABLE
1	Spent 15 hours getting amazing loot just to fall of a ladder and lose it all. 10/10 would autism again
1	ZOMbies glitching through walls like dayz smh . other than that pretty good for early release
1	Great game!!!
1	 10/10https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500392000"
-1	FIX THE LAG IN THE SERVERS!!!!
-1	another running sim
1	 if there was somewhere where I could safely keep all my loot (or sell it) or some form of base building (but I'm not sure how that would work in this game)"
-1	 the zombies dont do much and thay are kinda pointless and the susrvival aspect is nowhere to be seen. (Apart from playing a run-eat-sh*t simulator....)"
-1	Poor optimization. Memory Leaks. E1: Removed complaint about ultrawide support as it was added.
1	The little i played this game i found it very enjoyable. Its like an improved version of dayZ with a lot fun content. (10/10 getting a chocolate energy bar out of your prison wallet)Yes it does need some improvement however remember its still on early acces. I was hyped when i got it and im still hyped after playing for a little bit and i will still be hyped when i play again tomorrow.P.S. I will be even more hyped when they release female characters!
1	 dayz :D"
-1	solo gameplay is nearly (i play a lot of games like this) impossible try to get on a server and it will crash 30 seconds later framerate skips constantly i get that its earlly acess but it needs some work to be close to playable
1	 and the potential for a great game is definitely there.7/10 at the time of writing with a lot of room to grow."
-1	Scum
-1	 just not feeling it right now."
1	 Ran away and bled to death in a bathtub I'll stick to fashion"
1	Fortnite players hate it
1	 and am remaining positive that they will fix the performece problems."
-1	Possible titles for this game:- Running in the wood simulator 2018- Starving simulator 2018- No items found- Winner of the worst UI awards
1	The game have potential. Waiting for future update. Pls dont abandon the game developer like the other does to their game.
-1	 DONT BOTHER."
1	 10/10 worth every penny. Support the Devs . YA HEARD."
1	 than this game might just be the one for you."
1	Very good game / alone and whit friends :D!
-1	 here it is in it's somewhat shining glory but personally I'm out. Refund on my part."
1	 hitting all of them>Out of stamina>Got battered to death while being called the n-word11/10Moral of the story: Don't play this game by yourself"
-1	 play whit friends against enviroment (pve). after  asking a mod he said there wont be a ""singeplayer co-op"" and that the onlyway to play co-op is through renting a serfer.    the store page doens say co-op bit it DOESNT say rent a serfer for it."
-1	 was having fun until the server problem ruined it."
1	 simply because it isnt finished yet. Check if it's actually a quality review.. most negative ones are not."
1	 be patience is a EARLY ACCESS."
1	 having many glitches like server issues as mentioned before and not being able to cancle actions. There are probably many bugs that I just haven't discovered yet. It still seems very promising and I would recommend giving this a try. Let's hope the issues gets fixed quickly :)"
-1	just the clunkiest piece of garbage to come out of UNREAL ENGINE
1	 so I am not sure there is any server persistance."
1	I dont know how to take a whizz but its still a lot of fun
-1	 or how much fiber is in your diet... you're just happy to find something to fill your stomach. In my opinion it'd be best to wait until this game is out of early access to see if it can distinguish itself apart from every other survival game out there."
1	Great game
1	whats dayz?
1	 and the game runs smooth in my limitations. Really good optimization for all gamers. Would recommend."
-1	 but honestly. Until they add more stuff I can't recommend this one."
1	Good Game some server problems but its no problem for me because its early acess and can be fixed in the futur ;)
1	Solid game! Character movement and combat animation feels good!
1	 needs some reworking on video memory side  but in whole runs nice on gtx 1050 ti .. game is fun to play especially with friends."
-1	Another case of the trailers and videos are better than the game.Not currently worth it in my opinion.  My advice is to wait for several updates before buying in.
1	Game has potential.
-1	a very confusing game :)
-1	 time will tell if the execution is there but overall pretty fun and nerve wracking at times.Plus you can poop and pee."
1	 small accomplishments feel great. With some fine tuning to the craftic system and the games optimization (sprinkle in additional items and maybe other maps) the game will be that much better once all is said and done. 8/10 would gladly poop in the woods with a chance of being killed by a bear or zombie again."
1	 read forums or try to figue it out by trial an error. Otherwise STFU and go beatoff to some anime. God damn there are too many kids out there with access to a computer and a credit card. This is why I held off on DayZ and already its lightyears more entertaining on day 1 and a steal at $20. Keep up the good work and look forward to future updates."
-1	TERRIBLE dont buy
-1	 it's just poor craftmanship."
-1	 cheaters and hackers already own this game..... so sad. Can not reccomend at this time."
-1	 not forgetting the memory leaks. stay completely away from the lleft side of the map. fun to watch awful to play."
-1	It's like DayZ but you can poop.
-1	"Gave in on the social justice warrior and removed a tattoo in the game becuase it was ""offensive"". You're a prisoner killing zombies and getting one shot by robots. Pathetic you gave in."
1	 the Melee combat fluidity and the metabolism system in regards to medication and vitamins actually affecting you! Overall the game is addicting and is for both PVE players and PVP players! The game has a singleplayer option which I love! Worth all of of the $19.99 I refunded and re-purchased the game with!"
1	 it released like a week ago. We need more action! Thank you!"
-1	Full of hackers
-1	 BUT THESE TYPES OF GAMES ENCOURAGE THE HACKERS TO RUIN ALL YOUR HARD WORK. FULL OF HACKERS SO EARLY ON."
-1	 but these people will ruin your night of gaming. And it's going to be the onsies and twosies that keep popping up with hacks. Don't buy this game. It's a waste of money until they submit a devblog stating that they're actively banning people for hacking and solving the issue."
-1	 a 144 hz MSI monitor with 1ms response time. im only getting 30 FPS MAX with LOW SETTINGS. THEY FKED UP!"
1	I took a dump in the middle of the forest i had nothing to eat and was hungry. After pooping i find on the ground a wrapped chocolat bar. Seems like it went trough so i ate it again.
-1	 right."
1	This..... This just murdered DayZ..... No more waiting for what you were promised in DayZ. It is all right here in Scum.
-1	NO CARSNO BUILDING NO FUN!0/5
-1	 butthurt by the hype and want my money back in time to get gta instead."
1	I love it so far. There are some issues but I'd expect that from an early access game. Keep it up devs.
-1	 not worth 20 bucks."
1	I'm 28 hours deep. I joined a server/discord. Made some friends. Killed some puppets and raided some military bunkers. I having a blast. It runs great on even low end pc's. its going to bea  great game. DEVs are very active. 10/10
1	I bought a server i would like to know how can i pull up the admin options
1	 calling it a running simulator will only make yourself look dumb.Probably the best early access game I've ever played. For me they don't need to change anything just optimize the game and fix some bugs then they're ok."
1	 I'm friendly"""
1	 the single player content of SCUM is already worth its current price."
-1	 not fun in current state"
-1	 To soon to buy."
1	 AND P!SS ON MY FRIEND AGAIN"
1	 and this is a way to kill ur free time !"
1	 is to get rid of those AIMBOTTING robots. Replace them with a strong zombie or maybe a horde of zombies guarding the bunkers/military areas. Plus zombies/robots don't go together"
1	 10/10. It is worth way more than 20 bucks for sure."
1	Amazing so far cant wait until the vehicles come
-1	 I cant even hit escape to go back to previous screen. There is no way to play this game and i have to manually shut off mhy computer to leave game."
1	 but lots of potential"
1	Good game. Fun and had very little issues even though its an Alpha release
1	Looks and plays good so far. Lets see how the devs will handle this game in the future.
1	 it'll be better than any game it'll be competing with."
1	 sometimes doesnt seem to give option to load magazine or eject it from the gun?Played single first 3 hours- then multiplayer for a couple of hours on a server with 32 people- never saw anyone but was to busy trying to find bullets for my pistola.I did get booted from the server (diconnect) but later went back in notice  aall servers ping 999- but i found the one i was on and joined again no problemSo I look forward to it getting better"
-1	 at least you run fast."
1	The game is great..I'm really enjoying it but it surely needs a lot of fixes..Nice job <3
1	 but for an early acess game its pretty good."
1	 don't play and leave a bad review.."
1	10/10 dayz standalone = 0.01% from scumlook forward for new updates
-1	Game is looking fun but it needs to let you invite friends or friends invite you without hassle.
1	From the very little time I have played its been the most fun ive had in a game in a long time. Very intense and im always on the edge on my seat in towns/military outpost.
1	 so those will most likely be fixed. But this game delivers everything Dayz failed at delivering. 8/10"
1	 free running is the best i have seen for any survival game like this. look forward to seeing it fully completed."
-1	Hackers everyehere. Could not even get a single piece of loot in the little bit of time I played. Just kept getting killed after walking around a bit by thin air. Got a refund RIP SCUM
-1	 but I also bet it is Steams most refunded game as well."
-1	Can't search servers or join on friends wtf...
1	Enjoying it so far.
1	 this turd is SOLID."
-1	 but no way do I want to literally walk miles in a video game because the systems are too punishing to allow you to push beyond that. I cannot recommend SCUM to anyone really. Unless your $20 really cant be spent someplace else."
1	 this game shows amazing potential!  The Devs appear to have a drive to keep the updates coming.  The first day of release saw server issues.  The very next day they updated the game and fixed the issues.  I'm very interested with this game and i can't wait to see where it goes!"
-1	this game is sooo trash... thats it its trash.................... ask savage he was with me
1	pooped on my friend 10/10 would buy again
-1	Hackers teleporting around killing everybody in one shotGreat game
-1	Walking Simulator 2018
-1	Running simulator. Boring. Gigantic map and not enough players. Not enough loot unless it's the robot-secured places.
-1	 stable and overall enjoyable game."
1	Early access but this game is already very promising. Having a blast!
1	 rather than pandering to the never satisfied PvP crowd."
-1	 like some sort of map glitch! very frustrating and needs to be fixed"
-1	 but as of now a huge waste of 20$"
1	 if this gets fixed the game is more then worth buying.At this point its basicly everything DayZ standalone promissed to be and more !Wait a few weeks and get it once the server lagg is fixed."
1	 better than DayZ"
1	 knowing that my money is destined to build an excellent and innovative survival experience."
1	 we make away with our hard earned loot! Very exciting!"
1	 specially when you see devs so committed to improving it and face problematics ASAP."
1	 would do that again."
1	Can't stop playing. It's just too good and this is just the beginning of what it can be. Beautiful work. I am very exited for the future content.
1	good game but for sum reason it says i got ban for something i didnt even do. i went to get back on today. it says im band
-1	The PVP aspect of the game is completely broken... Have to try shooting a jumper goodluck. The teleporting when seeing another player is pretty cancer unplayable unless you have a shotgun
1	Yeet!!!
-1	 literally unplayable."
-1	Do not get this game. Its not fun at all. Mostly just running around. Then you get your player fully decked out and someone comes and kills you and takes all your stuff. You have no way of getting it back and have to take hours of wasted gameplay to get anything back. I would reccomend the developers create a system in which you can retain your equipment otherwise the game wont be lasting long. I will be requesting a refund. Don't waste your money folks.
1	if people like maybe have seperate servers depending on the players want for action"
1	 Alpha but very intresting!"
1	 also beautiful. Even with my Ryzen 2400g APU I get 20 30 FPS but can play just fine."
-1	 once they get it running right it will be great."
1	 but it is early access and it is barely out for a few weeks. give it time and im sure this game wont become dayz when it comes out of early access. this game is great and has potential it just needs time."
1	 would reccomended"
1	 the puppets shouldn't be a problem.  I enjoy the game for sure and am looking forward to the future.  very good first impression for me."
-1	fix the game
1	 give it time)-Mechs are buggy and overpowered (being fixed as well)-only good loot is at bunkers/POI's (they are working on this as well lol)so pretty much... there is nothing bad about this game that they won't eventually fix. I reccomend buying it so that they have the support needed to get them fixed ASAP. thanks for reading my opinions :)."
-1	I walked for 2 hours and got killed for a hacker...
1	the only thing i got on the game is that everytime i enter mech areas or towns i get alot of fps drop and stutters that get me killed and alot of memery usages and its almost unplayable. Anywere else i can play the game perfectly. Hopefully they optimize game for low and medium end pcs a bit better. the game is over all perfect my favorite is the bcu like come on what other survival game has it. I think its better then dayz.
1	But the Mechs are way too powerful. Goodluck getting any loot worth it without getting killed in the process and having to start all over.
-1	Needs much improvement.  Cannot at this time recommend the game int he state it's in.
1	Better than DAYZ
1	decent
-1	1/10
1	Please join the Chinese language as soon as possible
1	 afew bugs here and their but overall HUGE potential and devs to back it up."
1	I REALLY NEED TO URINATE
1	already better than dayz
1	The people who made this game have done a good job working on the game and fixing a few bugs i have seen here and there. I do find it difficult to open doors sometime even when the server isnt going to go down
1	The people hating on this game really dont give it the credit it deserves with it being in early access.  It has done a ton of work and receives frequent updates and thats with the devs listening to players and trying to make everyone happy.  The game is not for everyone and definetly has a unique group.  It is kind of like dayz except it works and its got a good bit more to keep up with and I think will be very different in the end as well.  Overall its a great game with great developers and if u see people complain just remember that not everyone loves this sort of hyper-realistic type of game that these amazing developers have done a great job on.
1	Yeah i was just in a building fully geared with about 6 hours of looting. All of the doors are closed and I get sniped by someone far out because the building didnt render in. Why even release the game if people can shoot you in buildings. Ive died twice to other players in ways that i cant even defend myself. Im okay with the mechs and the zombie mele combat. But seriously? walls not rendering in? A game shouldnt be released if it has problems like that!
1	 so far very few bugs. It is still an Early Access game so not all features are there yet with missions and some creation options - but its completely a better experience than that ...ahem... ""other"" open-world zombie survival game and its only been out a week or two."
1	I didn't have such an amazing and atmospheric experience in 4 years of DayZ and this game gave it to me in 10 hours of playing. Hella worth the buy in my opinion.
1	 but I can confidentally say it is worth the 20$!"
-1	I logged on and the servers are all laggy and you can barely get above 50 frames. It's not worth it right now but it has potential.
1	Great game. Very hardcore survival game. people that are hating are ignorant of the survival aspect. Bugs and desync but thats expected from an early access game.
1	 as its genuinly fun especially with friends. I see alot of potential so far and am looking forward to seeing what direction developers take this game."
1	Game is best game was everything I expected and is only getting better daily.
1	Worth. Every. Cent.
1	Good game. Well worth the 20. The survival side of it is new gen sh*t...
1	 chill players willing to help out."
1	and being bored but in the end you'll cook up a load of meat and crawl in your friends diarrhea so it's pretty worth it tbh."
-1	 a game to potentially buy at a later date."
1	Somebody came outta no where and tried to stab me for no reason really. Was a bit rude. Killed him with my MP5 then done a poo on him. Would recommend 10/10
1	 you can poopy yourself"
1	 but its a little rough. If you like that kind of gunplay then this game offers pvp that really gives you a reason to try hard. Dying has consequences.  Want to support devs of a survival sim with some potential? Buy the game. Or don't."
-1	boi was this game boring and empty refund it is
1	some potential but not really very fun at this point. also couldnt find any zombies?
-1	terrible game..
1	 16 gigs of ram 1600Mhz."
1	 a few crashes but hope they get fixed"
1	 either."
-1	 If they update this game enough it could find its niche."
-1	ima keep it real with you chief this game unfinished af lmao
1	 don't listen to the salty reviews that don't give legitimate criticism of the game. Try it out for yourself!"
1	Great game.
1	 content etc.Weather and graphics is fatastic.Valuting is really good.Lots of interesting content which I won't spoil - check it out.Still a lot more content to be added as expected with a $25 day one alpha........ but on the whole this is a fantastic start and we're looking forward to what else will be added."
1	 and in dire need of optimaztion for some) but I enjoy it. I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for the future."
1	Mr. Rocko approves.
1	 so good.fix items not showing on ground.  too much dependency on tab."
-1	 any of them."
1	 especially that you need to eat every 10 minutes even though you search 45 kitchens and find nothing. You also get sick just from running around and can'tfind medication anywhere. That's just the the basic stuff. Will be good in the future but for now it needs work. I really hope the developers don't ditch this like Dayz got ditched."
1	Great game for now fix the servers and game will be huge I recommend for now ;)
1	 buy this! Reminds me of DayZ MOD"
-1	 atleast then you might get a few hours out of it."
1	This has been better than any other early access game I have played.
1	 some fps issues on a lower end rig but thats to be expected."
-1	 and that's about it. There are little to no players to be found (no PVP) and you cannot make a base to store your loot. Anyone that roams the environment can open your loot chest.Lacking a lot of things and needs a lot of improvement! Hopefully the Devs make progress and keep updating the game :)"
1	"It didn't take 6 months to implement ""Vaulting""!"
-1	 use all cpu and totatlly laggs on single player :( Recommend only for people with 1000$ Pc"
-1	This game captivates you with its cool looking nature and nice graphics but after 3h of game play you realize that there is nothing to do in it at all. same as dayz. I would advise not to buy this game until they introduce the lore and the end game.
-1	 Easy loot and not a challenge at all. Believe the developer paid youtubers to promote his game."
-1	 not much to do in it at the moment"
-1	make sure you have more than 8GB of RAM even though it say's 8GB recommended.
1	cash anything"
1	The dev put the work into it.the game is fun on how to manage and survire need optimize and more crafting contentnerf that freakin sentryoverall 6-7/10 i can poop on my friend tent <3Edit* 9/3/2018
-1	 hope dev team can add various kind of NPC.4. Multiplayer needs anti-cheat.5.Dont forget sea server too.6.For now just stable the game please before adding more stuff like cosmetics.Thank you."
1	 an actual -survival- game!"
-1	its bad
-1	the ergo on macs are just stupid
-1	 the death mechanic very annoying if playing with buddies. Also zombies seem a little OP Im sure it will improve but just dont enjoy it at the moment"
1	 then go play another game."
-1	runs on 20-30 fps NOT OPTIMIZED YET.... key word YET.... i will visit back to this game once they optimize the settings
1	GREAT well rounded hardcore survival game. Looks great and runs fairly well considering it has only been out a few days. The devs seem dedicated also bc there have already been updates. For $20 you seriously cant go wrong!!!
1	 great value for money"
-1	 i cant accept..."
1	"
-1	 but it seems promising and is definetly worth the $20."
1	best survival game ever.. way better than dayz <33
1	 I think the robots are too overpowered. One robot saw me when I was crouched on top of a structure several stories tall. It proceeded to kill me with 2 shots while I was prone on that same structure."
1	Just got killed by a goat!
1	 Gun... Yeah. 10/10."
-1	the concept is great but im not gonna waste my time with a game that is 30 FPS no thanks
-1	Run Run Run then die by zombie scumbag
1	 Cant wait to see what the game has to over in the future :}"
-1	Boring
1	10/10 Would explosive diarrhea again.
1	 just trying to even the reviews against people who are complaining about ghetty things that don't have anything to do with the game itself."
1	 there is only war. Not fun unless you get money for sitting around doing it."
-1	 won't come back to the game in a year or few months to see if it's improved."
1	10x better than dayZ and it has only been out a day.
1	Spent an hour looting to find a pickaxe and beat a french guy to death with it. 10/10
1	So far its really laggy but it will get better.
1	 so its normal.It has a lot of potential if worked well.Lovely mechanisms and realism aspects."
1	Good Game Good developers fast on fixing bugs even though its a beta game its still fun and enjoyable. Good game to play together with friends.
1	 better than Dayz By about 2million miles"
1	Played for 5 hours and I can say I love it. It runs very smooth on GTX 1080 and it looks amazing. I don't expect it to be perfect as it's just EA... for now.
1	Shot a bearWore its skinFound out they do in fact s#!t in the woods10/10
1	 making looting not so boring as you cannot run from house to house without making sure there are no zombies around the corner. BUY IT NOW."
-1	 i would reccomend give it a few months when there is content"
1	 good fps and good loot"
-1	 it's a big yikes from me."
1	 it just needs a lot more stuff."
1	 negative review"
-1	 players warping all over the pace and horrible frames on a decent system."
1	Pee'd on my friends head while standing on the roof. 10/10
1	Amazing work. Keep it up!
1	 people were complaing about no anti-cheat and the next update they added one i think the devs really care about this game and for only 15 pound i can easily suipport if youre on the edge about this game give it a go and you might just like it i know i have very little hours so i will update my review at certain timestamps12 hours:24 hours:48 hours:"
1	This game has to add vehicels and fix spots where u fall to ur death with more crafting and its set. Just sucks not being able to meet with friends and building bases is tedious
1	this game is great everyone on here that gives it a bad review has like 1 hour and got killed by a hacker but if you play with a 5 man group of friends the game is still fun we all got killed by a man named fco.jgza in game and we logged out went to a new server and waited for him to get off then went to airfield and then foundry and got all the loot back in an hour it just depends what server your on the game is great it looks good its fun and realistic just in EA and can use some updates to it like bows or base building other than that i love this game 100%

1	 it's loads of fun."
-1	Experience after the Anti-Cheat update:> Spawned> Found no food / guns / ammo> After ~1 hour I found a gun and some bullets> Found a axe> Killed a deer> So much meat> Found a shooting range> Found a MP5 and a mag> Heard some steps> No one was there but I still heard steps > Found one player> He vanished in front of me> Suddenly I heard more steps> Got killed by at least three invisible players with automatic riflesConclusion:Multiplayer isn't fun because of cheater (I call them noobs because they have no skill so they need to use cheats to have fun)Side-Note: Reminds me of DayZ. It was promissing but it got overflowed with cheater
1	This is a good game. And gonna be better while developed.But food mechanic is to complicated and should be fixed ASAP.
1	 would do again."
1	You worry too much about your Metabolism in this game to the point that you stop caring for it in Real Life. - 10/10
-1	 die... Was hoping for something more in depth but I was really disapointed.Didnt crash tho and ran without slowdown on an i7 8700k and a 1080."
-1	 it's a new walking simulator. Servers are broken #bushdid9/11"
1	 way more things to craft and a better Netcode this is going to be the best Survival Game around. Give it time and enjoy your stay till then!If you want to have quick Action and KOS gameplay this is not going to be for you. But even if so you can easily hop into some Events and earn those juicy fame points there."
-1	can t  UPDATE.........lol"
1	Fun game but very buggy at the moment. The freezing of servers especially.
-1	Wouldnt buy the game right now its way to laggy
1	 it's great idea but it's bugged also when playing in FPP when you have a line of sight. Also remove the camo feature that make people not render when prone. Add FOV slider for first person and make FPP only servers.Fix Dsync.Good game !"
1	 people need to look at what there getting which is a lot for a VERY EARLY ACSESS GAME. Servers issues can be fixed and they are being fixed.  If you have the money and are looking for a survival game I really do suggest SCUM."
1	 will update review one day."
1	Empty Cupboard Opening Simulator 2018.11/10 would search 1000 empty cupboards again.
1	 I'm keeping it to support development but for anyone on the fence give it a few patches and see how it comes out."
1	I've been looking forward to this game for a while and first impressions are really good. Lots of updating needed but what is here at the moment is definitely worth it!
-1	SERVERS ISSUES IN INDIA HAD TO REFUND SHOULD HAVE RELEASEDTHE GAME YET.
-1	the game is early early early access and make nothing better than dayz at beginning !!!! trust me dont buy this game keep waiting maybe 1 year and then when its in sale you can buy it for 10 dollars not more
1	 but the developers actually handled it really well and had patches flying in faster than we could reboot the game. Well done guys.I only have 4 hours on it currently however there will be many many more to come."
1	[F] Search - No items found!finds sugar in the microwave and soda in the oven.
1	 my only wish is they add more stuff to craft which I have no doubt they will since this is only early access."
1	Its been 5 of releace days and its better and have more things to do than a 6 year old game called dayz <3
-1	 it said 15 hours played. LOL"
-1	mr bones says this game not fun enough
1	 however please fix the combat experience.  When all i see is a floating gun when i get in a fight it sucks.  I'll stick around and see how it goes but PLEASE IMPROVE THE COMBAT.  at this point im on the fence but i'd give it a shot if you haven't played already."
1	game is early access any of the negative reviews are stupid because they knew what they where getting into the game is very fun and is worth the 20$ the game has so much to it for the survival aspect and obviously the game isnt perfect the game needs to be worked on it but it has alot of potential.
1	 can you withdraw money back?"
1	I UPVOTE IT CAUSE ITS BETTER THAN DAYZ 2 DAYS AFTER RELEASE AND I CANT EVEN RUN IT ON MY POTATO. FU BOHEMIA
1	I can poop 11/10
1	 they always listen to its community."
1	+
-1	 at least before they add servers without fame system."
-1	 most the people i have talked to in game enjoy but are just killimg time till fallout 76 releases says alot about the game there is already an experation for several people i have met. loads of missed ops here guys if you feel like riding another ark into the ground but this is one i will be abondoning rather soon. shame though it runs butter smooth."
-1	 I can't set it back to English.So yeah that's a thumbs down for now."
1	 way to go!"
1	 but after 10 hours of playing it gets really boring and repetetiv. They have to fix the desync because the pvp isnt worth doing if you only tradekill.."
-1	 i'm getting 50 fps on lowest setting and 30 on max... so there's a 20 fps difference between epic and lowest... the fighting is pathetic since your arms go straight through the ""puppets"" and doesn't deal any damage if this happens. The game got potential but i wouldn't recommend it as of today."
-1	When do you solve the problem with desync ????????????????? Is starts being stupid .. i didn't find a server without lag yet !!! And my net is 300 Mbps !!!!! PLEASE SOME EUROPE SERVER WITHOUT DESYNC !!!!
-1	 give it a go.update to my review. i would like to note that there is a unbelievable amount of hackers. i have spent hours gearing and to be instantly killed by a new player teleporting to my location and 1 shot punching me is unacceptable. because of that i have to unrecommend this game. its amazing and fun but until they fix the hacking its virtually unplayable. they are 9 times out of ten with a chinese name. their needs to be a killcam/report system for obvious players that hack and kill you."
1	 the only action available at this time is forward and backward movement. The dynamics and realism of this game is stunning though in a way that I feel totally emersed in the environment (with the rather cumbersome exception of learning the actions on the fly as a zombie beats me into a pulp). The other trouble lies in the recurring notification that my character is perpetually hungry despite the mushrooms and corn that im consuming. Im really looking forward to getting back into this game as the developers work out the kinks and getting up to more than eating shrooms and corn."
1	 it is in early access so their are a couple of bugs but runs really smoothly!"
1	Great game considering it's only a week old in EA.Huge map so lots of travelling but it's a true survival game in an interesting setting.
1	 and entertaining. I can't wait to see what comes later on down the road with more crafting and surviving abilities."
1	Def a work in progress. a decent survivor game if you like that. though it seems gotta find the right server so its not completely empty which a huge map where you cant find anyone.
1	 even tho it's still in a very fresh Early Access.Looking forward to the next updates!"
1	BEST EARLY ACCESS I HAVE TRIED!!. The game looks fantasic and even that its just a sandbox at the moment there is alot to do and see. Looking forward to see this as it goes.
1	Igra je zakon
1	 Its only going to get better. 7/10"
1	 very good."
-1	Terrible Game H1Z1 Knock off no objective you will never find your friends before you starve to death or get killed by a hacker.
-1	 more hope exists now that this game will become a staple in my library for years to scum."
1	 hopefully some more optimization and enchanced performance from the devs in near future. apart from that seems like scum will become a decent ""survival game"" in good time."
1	Not fully done yet but i have great hope for this game. Def 1 to watch!
-1	Only game ive been crashed upon adjusting simple settings such as audio. 10/10
-1	 wait for later builds to the game becomes more starter friendly or has vehicles and the robots are brain dead you can pass them like there nothing and you can get late gear instantly depending on where you spawn. 3/10."
-1	 I really wouldn't recommend a purchase."
-1	Same ol survival gameplay: Find a gun -> Kill other players -> Die -> Repeat.I hope the game devs will change the game so theres someting to aim for and this may give the game a future but if not i fear that Scum is going to fall flat.At this point i cant recommend.Will change this in the future if the game changes.
1	 and in a better setting.  I would absolutely recommend if a fan of that genre."
-1	 maybe wait a month or 2 (I know this game will be great just needs time).That said if you want to get in early and watch it evolve... a $19.99 pre-order is pretty cheap"
1	 I have had a brilliant experience so far and I'm sure most others will too if they put in the time to learn the mechanics before giving up on the game."
1	 Its a novel concept that most games seem to get wrong but SCUM does ever so right."
-1	 start starving to death no matter how much food i eat and hard crash my system in both games. The rest of my playtime has been spent rebuilding the same character 20 times only to fail joining a server."
1	 get some meds/food/water/gun/ammo... I'm not sure why people are complaining to be honest. Game runs exceptionally well with hardly a stutter. Fantasticly game with fluid vaulting and great inventory/looting!Please keep it up"
1	This game is a better more optimized version of DayZ 10/10Awesome survival mechanics hit detections pretty good.Best feature is the ability to poop/urinate on your dead enemies corpse right before you eat his flesh 10/10
1	Day Z with actual developers lol
1	 although it has lots of bugs and missing features at this time. I trust the developers to hammer out the fixes and get the game out of Early access ASAP."
-1	 fails to deliver. Atleast for me.My Specs:I7 4790kgeforce 980gtx16 gigs of ramand im NOT running it from an SSDThe result are 60-80 fps on default settings with hickups and stuttering as things get rendered in. To get 120+ i had to tone it down to 720p and turn almost everything off/low. That smoothed it out but it didnt help the fact that aiming down sights still felt terrible. The low FOV didnt help that feeling either and ofc the game looked like i forgot my glasses. Trying to identify items on the ground = mission impossible.My Recommendations to the developers:Intigrate a ""hold"" option for aiming down sights. (i would personally also like to see a transition rather then instant pop in.)Intigrate a FOV sliders for ADS and Firstperson in general.Optimize performance LIKE CRAZY.Especially the last part here doesnt sounds particularly flashy on a update news page. But who cares about 3 new backpacks when playing feels aweful.As it stands the game is just unenjoyble for me. The ADS (aim down sights) and Framerate beeing the MAIN reason why.So if you have a beastly computer that can handle it. And you don't mind toggle aim down sights with low FOV. Give it a shot. Otherwise i cannot recommend the game in it's current state."
-1	The name should be copy 'n paste simulator
1	 I rate 10/10."
1	 never play DayZ again. These devs obviously have their heads in the right place. *cough* Bohemia *cough*"
1	 Better than dayZ will ever be at release..."
-1	Sadly the performance is extremly bad. If you don't own a 1080 or higher the game will be a slideshow. Also the game suffers severe memory leaks and your performance will reduce by an aditional 30% after playing about an hour (and even more if you don't relaod).In Addition Servers are crashing all the time.Gameplay itself looks nice. Movement System is really well done and the game seems to have a very complex loot system.Though because of the performance and server issues I can't recommend the game to anyone at the moment.
-1	 I won't play it as it stands but I will be looking forward to the next update/patch & am more than happy to support the concept."
1	looks like a good game that could have alot of potential :)
-1	44 fps@1080p nvidia 970 all low..... uhm
1	great game!
1	 great game.Really looking forward to new content."
-1	The Roboters destroy the whole PVP in this Game. As long as they are in this game i would not recommend it.
1	 hope the devs dont pull a culling on us"
1	 and this is without a shadow a doubt worth every penny.some games strive to be this good on completion and this is only a one week old alpha. so far almost daily patches that have improved the playability of the game with devs that give constant updates.....yes there is the odd lazy children who want satnav a vehicles but i believe they forgot to read past the title...this is a prison survival game and i would like to know where the item they are demanding got into a prison island...keep up the excellent work people... 8/10 so far.....i would give 10 but the fighting with puppets needs a lot of work....ie a puppet has a bigger reach than me while i am holding and swinging a large axe or club.."
1	found bottle of absinthdrinks bottle of absinthpoos himself throws uppasses out for an hour IRL!!!! A WHOLE HOUR!!!!i realise i could just do this myself instead of laughing at the screenlog out10/10
1	get rid of the fame points or spawn on team mates game will be heaps better
-1	 so i will wait it for full release/out from early accessgot refunded"
-1	Don't purchase this game if you're looking for fun. It's a looting sim where you'd have to feed your character more than you meet enemies.
1	R.I.P DayZ.... this game has actually devs that are working to finish this game :) 4.5/5 for an EA. - needs good computer to run it playable. forget 960's  if you dont want potato graphics.
1	 so for MATURE gamers only"
-1	 still same. Ask for refund- nope you played for more than 2 hours. FML......"
1	 but you have no right to judge me""thanks for reading"
1	I love it finaly a good survival theme game! Fast patching! Good game engine nice graphics!  Cant wait too see what will become of this game. DayZ is dead and this game struck the last blow! Gj!
1	Liking the first release of the game. Fun and challenging with really nice gameplay mechanics that together makes the survival aspect really good. Optimization is bad and only time will tell if the devs are up to the job of releasing steady updates - to many have failed at that task in EA
1	 with the promise of more to come. Hope to see that more sooner rather than later."
1	 thumbs up for support so far!"
1	The dayz killa.
1	 just rainy and dark. Game is great though!!"
-1	 hopefully they make a DLC called common sense and have a few ammo laying by weapons. Please don't tell your buddy to get this as there is no party funciton and joining the same server you'll 99.9% be spawned 99 billion miles from them and have to walk all the way to meet up."
-1	 filled with nothing."
-1	SCUM is a scum game.
1	10/10 even in early access
-1	Didn't like it...
1	Can fps drops be fixed as soon as possible please? I run a nice fps until it drops to a freeze every 5 seconds
1	It's early doors but this game has been good fun tonight. Found some weapons and got attacked by a mech. A passing player donated a pitch fork to my cause. It's Animal Crossing meets Titanfall. Everyone's lovely and f**king ROBOTS!
1	 but it is the second day that the game has been out. So many tiny things implemented in the game make this game so fun. It's like they took the best systems from all survival games and put it into this one. The gunplay is decent enough and there is even a combat system for melee in the game. There are so many things and skills that you can learn. The game even has crafting. The only thing I want them to add in is base building or something like that. Having clans or bases  would make this game very fun. Overall I'd give the game a 9.5/10. I recommendplaying on singleplayer for a better and more immersive experience."
1	 Arma 3 Exile or Breaking point just to name a few <3"
1	 it was time for the 1st poo... :oIt was a majestic hard as a log dump! Amazingly it dropped 1 MP5 magazine!!! :DWhat have i been eating?! :o"
1	Great game with lots of potential
1	Atleast one of us is getting proper diet11/10 for this game
1	 the biggest point here - this game is made by Indie developers with backing of Croteam and Devolver Digital - and they achieved more in 1 year than biggest studios like Blizzard in a decade."
1	 until I turned down my render resolution from 100 to 70 and went from 30 FPS on the lowest settings to 65-70 on medium-high settings.Then it sucked 10 minutes later"
-1	 it's cropped."
1	 then this is a must buy!"
-1	"Keep it nice and simple.You go onto the game and your first thought is ""Mad"".After an hour of running around ""Boring"".Give it a month or two."
-1	$20 Day-Z mod where customize whether your character is fat or muscular and you start with an orange prison uniform.
1	 cant delete my saved setting or game save to try fix the issue because im using Geforce now and saves are in the cloud and not on local drive."
1	 either solo or with friends it is a refreshing take on the survival genre.  Holland"
1	AWESOME..... Cant wait for what they add next !!  SICK GAME
1	 and gun play. These all need worked on before i think they should add anything else to the game. If the get these fix I honestly thing it could be an amazing game. I recommend buying this game in the next month or so. They are fixing things fast but some people may get super upset at lagging and dying. Can't wait to see where the game goes in the future."
1	 zombie apoc. game. Would recommend."
-1	 makes it 50FOV which makes people sick"
1	 I really enjoy this game."
1	 very hard top find friend's server's"
-1	The innovative features look cool but contribute very little to the game. After a very short time you will run out of things to do. It got boring real quick but hopefully the devs keep working on it. Also the robots suck and should be replaced with something more fitting to the game.
1	 because the RAM usage is really high and with a GTX970 I can only play the game on medium/low settings if I want 60+ fps. On Higher settings the fps dips all the way down to 20fps. They game still looks good on low settings though so it is not a big deal.Overall I think the game has a lot of potential and is currently already very playable. If you are into survival games then this game is defenitely worth a try."
1	PUBG + DayZ = SCUM
1	jysla kjekt
-1	 bugs and issues that in my opinion ruin the game for now"
-1	 sitting around a box of loot while cooking meat on a campfire."
1	Dope game!
1	 but i'm sure it'll get there"
1	 and I can't wait to see where they go with further features and improvements."
1	It could be better. I think it will get better. Devs are putting in the time and effort to make responsive and positive changes to make the game better. But right now... if I was sitting on the sidelines. I'd wait.
1	 it's already on par with or better than the originators who are still ""alpha"". (Slam)   This is the game we have been waiting for!"
-1	 spending $20 on this trash or wasting 20 minutes of my time on this trash."
1	super awesome game ive had lots of fun in here please continue to work hard to perfection the DEVS are active as ever thank you
1	Survival check yestakes a bit to learn wat to eat for minerals and vitaminspee and poop plus vomit bonusbreak bones yes my health is running out kak scaryfinding out you actualy needed to gym more at virgin for all the runningin the end actualy very nice wen playing with friendswww.sologaming.co.za
1	 this one is hard to beat.  As of this review I have 12 hours of SCUM gameplay and I have enjoyed every minute.  If you are a fan of hardcore open world survival games this is worth a try for only $20.  When playing an alpha game you have to look past the bugs and issues and decide if the core game is something worth sticking around for and of all the alpha games I have purchased (A LOT) this one is at the top of my list of worth it.   I look forward to what scum will become in the future.For an Alpha game i give this a 7.5/10."
1	 you couldn't congratulate them more."
-1	 fix it until then PVP is incredibly frustrating if you encounter a big group of people who constatly spawn on each other."
-1	Is this the most boring game I have ever played? IDK. For only $20 you can find out if it is the most boring you have ever played.
1	 has 10/10 potential."
1	Wowzerz took a fat steamy sh*t in front of a player getting gangbanged by a horde of chompers
1	This game is great so far.  Obviously it is early access and everything hangs on the devs but even if I quit playing today I would feel that I got my money worth out of it.  I really hope to see it grow.
1	 game play great! If the devs keep up on it and add content like I hope. It can be epic."
-1	 but has potential."
1	14 hours in and having a great time
1	then kills me.10/10 would play again"
1	nibbas buy or back to dayz
-1	Unplayably laggy trash combat. Hungry before food ever comes up. Overcomplicated on things that dont need to be overcomplicated. Griefers galore.
1	Right now its a very vanilla dayz clone with better graphics sound is very misleading needs work crafting system also fubar nice graphics zombies take a good beating and react to it nicelyand for your fecal matter enthusiast you can take a dump <--------- 7/10 realism you dont use tp you use your hand and never seem to clean it!!!
1	alredy better than arma / dayz and i have over 1700 hours in arma 2 alone ^^ buy it as long as it is that cheap or ur gonna regret it later when all ur friends play it 24/7 ^^
1	 I like that they added SP! I cant wait to see what they add to this game hopefully we can see some ai bandits! But So far i am Loving this game!!!"
1	 but definitely best one out of the battle royal games"
1	veri gut
-1	 just keep an eye on it."
-1	 taken out the back and shot. Absolutely ruins what could otherwise be a great game. That and the potato servers people are FORCED to use for now. If you are going to force one server host on everyone at least choose a host that can actually deliver."
1	 and alot of bugs. Just give it some time ffs."
1	"THIS GAME SO GOOD BUT I GET LOW FPS AT  LOW SETTING :""(AND ADDED SEA SERVER PLSS"
1	 pvp is okay might need a bit of a tweak and servers seem stable. We will just have to wait to see how this game progresses with patches and content.https://store.steampowered.com/app/513710/SCUM/#"
1	you have to poo and pee when your butt and weiner gets full
-1	Dont make a game with limited sprint and where u cannot spawn at your friend without earning repfkno
1	This game is what DayZ should have been already.
1	TOP TIER LOOTING SIMULIATOR 2K18.!
1	nice game 8/8 m8 wanna r8 <3
1	 maybe wait for a couple of patches."
-1	 getting really sick of eating zombie meat."
-1	 0 content is actually in the game(not 1 thing to do aside loot loot loot loot loot) also battle royal matchs triggered by a event timer(very nice) but boring as hell with 0 crafts to do 0 gear to make use of and storage cant be locked?..."
-1	Dayz is better
1	 performance and hackers being the main ones. Other content has been added to the game and development and progression of SCUM is obviously ongoing. This game has so much potential and it looks like the developers are going to have a serious go at fulfilling that potential."
1	this game is laggy as hell and performance is poor.but i think devs are good ppl and they care about the players and the game.its worth a buy if you want to support the devs.
1	 looking forward for more!"
1	 there is so much more content to be added. There are so many possibilities with the direction they can take the game. Since its come out it's been the only game I've played"
-1	The crafting system is so tedious
1	 It will help you learn stuff!! GREAT GAME so far.."
-1	 but the thing is they make it way to hard to understand... like the crafting system and the character information and dygesting etc. make it an easyer system!!!!!!"
-1	 and you get hungry so fast and it takes hours to find your friend(s)"
-1	It's fun... If you have friends to play with. I just hope they add vehicles and actually fix the energy system because seriously WTF why is it on 0 and im getting fat after eating an apple??Might change the review depending on changes
1	game is good. keep on developing. dayz in 2018 and in good.
-1	 the hell with the anti cheat? improve the anti cheat ! and ban china from the game."
1	 just buy it and kill cry babies"
-1	pretty fun and solid 10$ survival game. cheaters totally ruin the game. dont buy yet
-1	Another game to play then realise there isnt really anything to good about it. Kill some hours when bored but thats about it.DayZ with an engine upgrade.
-1	Devs are power hungry and the forum mods like to brown nose.The game? Anti cheat is garbage.
1	 plays nice with about 30-40 ppl on a server not 64. so pretty lots to do needs work but its early access."
-1	Very funny game 4/5
1	 yes the PvP isn't great right now.. but it's coming along.  Graphics are very quality and the survival is so in-depth it'll take a while to learn.I'd recommend this game right now at $20.  It'll be fun to see how it develops over the next year or two."
1	 wait until it gets better."
1	 if that's not your type of game then look elsewhere."
1	 especially for such early access.  Dev's are very quick to fix issues as well as update and release new content.  Can't ask for more from an early access survival game!"
1	Like dayz but better executed
-1	 then OK."
-1	Has potential. Would not recommend right now.
1	Heaps of fun so far. Great game to play with mates.
1	The Mechs make me mad but other than that A-
1	 and lets see where this goes"
1	 it's worth checking out."
1	 try it out."
1	 Survivors."
1	I will admit the game is very early in development and theres a lot of content to be added. Pay the $20 trust me it's still good but with all this support when the game goes out of early access it will easily be one of the best. 7/10 so far but i can easily see this game to be a 9.5/10
1	Why not?
1	 get eaten."
-1	 so you can imagine how BAD this is."
1	 probably not."
-1	 this game is just like day-z were could kill zombies with your fists in this game you cant even kill them with a shotgun shot to the chest what is going on?The spear is the best weapon in the game give me three spears 3 kills but with 3 shotguns shell im dead why it makes no sense."
-1	 check back in a year."
-1	 gameplay unclear."
1	Amazing game.
1	Better than Dayz
1	at first couldn't even connect to a server which was very frustrating but once i succeeded then it was very fun with my mate..had such a good time  and played for 10+...of course the game is at beggining and has soo much space for  improvement and soo many things too add and if done right by de developers this game could easily become one of the best survival games of all time i do not regret buying this at all
1	 chased a deer on foot.I cant wait to see where this game goes and how good it gets. They foundation is hella sturdy."
1	Really great game would def recommend to looter shooter fans and survival game fansi'd like to note this has a single player mode to for those interested and that's what my current 4 hours has been on and i really enjoy it will be playing a lot more of it till i jump on the servers but that being said there is a lot to be improved.
1	 Also a tutorial would have been useful."
1	Better than Dayz
1	Cheaper then Dayz and i would assume runs better..I would say wait since it just came out but right now its worth a plus.
-1	 would do it again."
-1	I spent 1 hour in the dark and found nothing. I then spent the next hour with no food or water. I then after 1 hour 45 min found a guy with full gear and an AK and he killed me on the spot. This game isn't fun. Its way too slow. Not easy to find friends or add freinds. I can't imagine this getting even one good review.
1	Very fun game!
1	 and no lagging. These devs are amazing!"
1	Amazing 10/10
1	 good job developers.Finaly real survivor game.9/10"
1	 fix optimizationAwesome survival game!"
1	 if you do it now. It cancels what you eat. -128 player servers. -Less fame points lost when you die/suicide. -Spawn closer to your friends. And how the **** do i use cigarettes? I have only played 2.6 hours and i love it. It is just smalls things like this that i feel can make the game much more fun and playable."
1	 if it drops on the floor its got a good chance to disappear especially if your stood next to something."
1	 a longer review might come once I get to play a couple hours more."
1	Started the game weighing 83 kilos and at this moment i weigh 102 Kilos. Great game.
1	 make us suffer.. painfully pleasantly slow... make us survive!"
1	 Hello SCUM."
-1	Get killed by robots and random lag spikes because people are near you. 0/10 would not lag out again.
1	Nice game
-1	unplayable amount of bugs
1	Already better than Dayz.
-1	Crafting is broke. gather all the items needed and you can't craft.  Played many games like this and this one is on my list of waste of money.
1	Like DayZ but good
1	So far... awesome game
-1	Refunded after 40 min....why? Instant respawn kills because of cheaters on official servers. Not worth the hassle in its current state.
1	I like it alot.
1	 as it evolves its sure to becaome even better.Some bugs as expected but very playable once you learn the basics."
1	it's like a DayZ with a lot of minerals.
1	Already better than Dayz
1	 creeping through the woods at night amidst the growls of wildlife and puppets is intense.  I am definitely in this one for the long haul.  I hope that it lives up to its potential.  It could easily become one of the best survival games on the market.  Buy it now why it is only $20."
1	 his mom's socks and a wooden spear stabs me in the face and takes all my loot. #walkingSim2018 #DayZstarvationMod..... 10/10 would waste 5 hours of my Fu**ing life walking accross a map just to get lag killed again."
1	 I am going to refund the game because of it's state and lack of stuff to do. I'm not a fan of scavenging supplies with no base building and no purpose. You can play Arma 3 exile or Arma 3 Dayz and have a better experience."
1	 If it hasn't already."
1	Ended up almost nothing t makes my an appointment cuz of this game. The best version they could have released in early access. Extremely happy.
-1	 Refunded"
1	good game
-1	You've got to be a actual brainlet to enjoy this game.
-1	 also im not a big fan of the copy and paste villages with buildings that have the same layout but thats the easiest thing to change so i wont dwell on that muchmy review will definately change in future if you keep up the work and i wish you guys good luck because i want to see this game become the best it can"
1	 the game is fantastic. Crafting works and fighting is fun and the idea and the bodymonitor is pure genius."
1	 it's just in Early Access."
1	This game has a ton of potential and already looks amazing so I'm hopeful it'll get the TLC from the devs that it deserves.
1	 you'll love this one."
1	 it has optimization problems that need to be solved ASAP  but for now the game is going in the right direction!"
-1	 and if that happens I will change my review."
1	Fun....mecs not great over all its fun to 1 tap people in head.
1	10/10 gud game
1	 i guess they all just have really old hardware and/or never update their drivers."
-1	 5 rope and watched a youtube tutorial. Item still greyed out."
1	 combat may be bare bones at the moment but still works very well with no bugs. cons: the game just has yet to reach it's full potential and the material missing is simply because they aren't done yet.Give this game a shot!"
1	 can't wait to see how it turns out after EA."
1	If you have friend then buy this game but if you think that you will have fun solo.. then this game ist for you...The game is not for evryone.. iv playd this game in early stages and i can say it come in god way. but ther is much to be don here... 10/10 (cuz i am from croatia)7/10 (realistic) :D(I DONT KNOW WHAY PEOPLE THING THIS HAVE SOMETHING WITH EA)This is standalone commpany i croatia and they launch game alone whit litle healp of croteam wich is also NOT own by EA.. they are just publised SS serial.....
-1	Terrible
1	 thats where the fun begins.."
1	10/10 would poop again
1	Ben Shapiro approves
-1	The last 4 hours are the most boring and wasted hours of my life. PRO's:You can walk.CON's:There would have to be some kind of game in order to list cons. There isn't because there is simply no gameplay. There is quite litterally NOTHING to do in this game. NOTHING. You are better off eating paste.
1	Best poop simulator ever
1	 but not whole. Some part of us has been left behind. In the woods south of town in District B2."
1	This game has so much potential and is coming along pretty fast. Yes it has its bugs but the devs have been doing a great job with the updates. Cant wait to see what the future holds for the game.
1	Scum is the best survival game of all time
1	 then this game is gonna be huge by the time the full release happens. 10/10 Would recomend to friends!"
1	Nerf the mechs...
1	 what else is there to say get the game its worth the money."
1	Early Accress but very nice game! See you in one year again Dayz <3
1	 if you play a server someone created then there is no dsync at all. There is so much potential for this game that if the devs keep working on it then its going to b a good gameI run a gtx 960 2gb with a i5 4690k @4.0ghz and i get good fps on medium settings without any lag spikes."
-1	 it just needs the filling."
1	Skinnned a dear and it turned into a donkey. 10/10
1	 brings up memories of the golden days of the DayZ mod..."
-1	 I guess there are better things to do in life."
-1	 SSD. Is there any optimization on this game? I have refunded it"
1	 I WOULD LIKE MORE WEAPONS AND ARMORS WITH STATS/GRADES AND BUILDING MATERIALS FROM WOOD-STONE-METAL AND STORAGE FOR ITEMS WHICH WILL MAKE IT TRUE SURVIVAL GAME."
1	 but DayZ in no amount of years could be where scum is. The game has tons to do. multiple threats. Lots of crafting. tons of area o explore. I'm stoked for the future."
-1	Crap game
1	I am hungry
1	 get good and don't expect a finished game when you buy into early access."
1	9.5/10
1	 really enjoy the gun play and constant struggle to survive."
1	Best game you can take a big doo doo on a table 10/10 game of the year would recommend
-1	optimization problems and stamina makes the game quite bad.I know this game is an early access game so maybe I'll change this review after new updates."
-1	s h --- it
-1	 consider this before buying the game."
1	 definitely better with friends."
1	 think rationally and have patience.Can't wait for the basebuilding and friends optimisations."
1	dont let a couple of bad reviews put you off."
1	wish if you could just pick your poop up and throw them to someone
1	 the devs seem like they are going to do the best they can to support and develop the game."
-1	Just play Rust. this game not good
-1	 zombies and players warping making them unkillable in a tight situation."
-1	it s like dayz 3.0 boring as f uck don t buy it it s just a hype from streamers just sitting with  the gear doing nothing and people are watching this garbage ..... i ve refunded this sh it
1	If you like survival games then you need to own this game. I have only played 5hrs but have already got my moneys worth of fun out of it and hey when you can kill somebody and lay a mad grogan right on their head well thats a sold to me ahahaha
-1	 play for 1 hour and 59 minutes then get a refund. you will see. :)"
-1	 but i I feel like if these points are not fixed I can't recommend this game to anyone.I will patiently wait for fixes/changes and edit my review in that case!EDIT 4th of September : 21:9 support is there. Thanks!"
1	first go at playing the game i crapped out an akm
1	 not that it ammo10/10"
1	killed a player then took a sh*t on his dead corpse then i ate him10/10
1	We often say that the hour of death cannot be forecast. When we say this we imagine this hour would be in a distant future. We never thought we would be thinking about Day Z as a memory. R.I.P Day Z
1	19.99 way better than dayz already...game has early access issues but what game doesnt..servers etc will get figured out..buy this game..
1	So Far loving This game .... Good Graphics and having tons of fun with my friend raiding militarty bases and stocking up on gear with our shelter and boxes we have built in the woods... cant wait to see what is added to this game .... hopefully more players... to run into more people while playing. hope to see a feature to where we can build our own houses and lock our stuff up... Drivable Veh. bigger event mode players.... allow everyone in the server to join the game maybe by notification .. But other than that i really cant wait to see where this gane goes ... 8/10 and cant beat 20.00 bucks
1	 Iron this!""10/10 will degrade woman named becky again."
1	 the devs dont like that bad trait. Nor the mechs."
-1	this game is boring. you loot 90% of the time. its just so slow. the map is way to big. no interesting pvp fights.
-1	Run for 3 hours. Find no one. 64 pop server with a huge map. Boring
-1	"
-1	terrrible
1	 but this game is a blast. I got it on release day and I can't get over the work that was put into it."
1	I am enjoying myself.
1	One of the best survival games good job keep the good work going.
1	awsome game.
1	Amazing survival game as itr is right now. I can't wait to see what the futuere holds for this game.
1	 and lower the number of available servers. I've encountered 3 total people in 17 hours on a (mostly) full server."
1	 SCUM is an early access game which not only feels polished but has alot of content and is only going to grow.."
1	gUd gAmE !
-1	 totally worth 20 bucks once you get past the finger-sniffing hump."
1	 and dying many many...many...many...many... times."
1	WOOOOOOOWZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

1	 maybe a bit too much for my laptop to run but then again that could just be the optimization. really it's up to you whether you think it would be worth the money or just wait until it's updated a lot more to buy it but yeah it certainly does have the foundation of a nice survival game. not to shabby."
-1	so many bugs
-1	 the singleplayer is better"
-1	n a y
1	 loot some more & sniped by crapping camper by the gas station. Respawn SCUM!"
-1	 then all of the above will be pointless. lol"
1	Decent for a game Pre Alpha/Alpha."
-1	I JUST GOT SCUMMED
-1	takes forever to make things. just not for me. will get sniped.
1	Great game
1	i'm giving this game a good review for a good reason but i have to say the lag is really really bad i've done all i could but nothing works besides making the render distence low but i'm not giving it a bad review for a small problem it could be my end having poor internet or my pc is acting up even though it's a gaming pc but the other reason is i have a feeling this game will get better cause it's lots of fun and has a cool concept and i will be rebuying  it when things get fixed
-1	Honestly the game is mostly hype. The loot is VERY scarce and the charactar designer is kind of a joke as you can choose between 5 preset faces and you can ONLY be male at the current time. I refunded after 3 hours because of various bugs and the game (as I said) being VERY overhyped.On the upside the game looks ok (not groundbreaking) at the highest settings.I would say wait on picking this up for at least 6-8 months for more content to be in the game.
1	 pvp is difficult but not impossible"
1	 maintaining a healthy metabolism (I love the complexity as I have a reasonable knowledge of nutrtion and physiology) and building fame points (this most likely with have more purpose with new mechanics)If your not ADHD this game may be for you."
1	I care more about my SCUM character than I care about myself.
1	 which i have no clue why. yeah you can die from 120349143048012391028031029814390 different things but it just adds to the fun. also the game is 10 days old and will have better updates."
1	 this game is extremely promising."
1	Love The Game You Devs Keep Working Hard This To Me Is My Favorite Survival Game This Beats DAYZ 100% This Game Has Almost No Bugs At Least So Far But Sometimes Minor Issues Here And There But It's Still In Early Acess I Will Be Playing This Game Alot Because I Love The Game Keep Working Hard Devs.
1	 we hope to further optimize.2. build homes3. add vehicles4. perfect Chinese Translation5. resource addition"
1	 Dont buy it. Just dont expect too much."
1	Great game great start to a decent work in progress lol
-1	This game is so broken. Redo it from the start alfa test before you put all of us through this painful beta.
1	 aun esta muy verde pero ahi la lleva 8/10 Puedes Cagar Sobre tus enemigos!! Literalmente!!!"
1	 you supported the devs for us all and you not going to pay the massive release price seeing as you already own it.PS: ""friend"" has killed me 3 times xD :)"
1	 the things they have implemented in this short time is great and so much more to come.Just from the caracter creation screen I can allready see why this game will probably be the best survival based game by the time of the full release. Some people might find it boring or lack of content but if you complain about it then don't buy a game in early access. I want to see this game develop and in this short time i've played it I fell in love and I get excited to think about where this game is going."
-1	 0/10."
1	I dont know why this game has mixed reviews its alpha and for alpha its pretty bloody good! not much to do besides loot military bases and get geared up but even just surviving is fun and just looking around. worth the $20 because this game is going to dominate dayz and the likes of.
-1	 on a somewhat consistent basis. And i'm not seeing that here."
-1	Bad Game!
1	 wrong time. Guess I really am SCUM.7/10 - Already a fun time waster and definitely has the potential to keep growing and getting better."
1	great game hope it works on its bugs and the gun play it does need a bit of work but as it is  its a good game  and hopes it keeps its quality up
1	Nice game i have enjoyed to play it but its lacking the base building aspect becouse at this point game doesn't allow you to build anithing besides a shelter and a wooden box where you can store your goodies. A option to make a party with friends so you can se where they at on the map will be a good feature to . Big thank to the devs for an awesome early acces will defintly wait for more content and updates
1	 cant wait for  better optimization and no teleporting..."
1	Spawn in.Agro a random zombie.Run.See 2m tall fence.Aware of climbing so start climbing.Zombies 1 step and is on the other side.Freak out.Die of bleed because i dont trust anything now.
-1	 but the controls are a bit clunky and a lot of things feel hit-and-miss. I may revisit this game once it's had some time to mature. Definitely not worth putting money into just yet though."
-1	 unless you're wanting to support the developers. I'll try it again later when it's had more work done"
-1	 but he said that he will fix it by Deleting the game.the game continues to start to stop and start stopping to also startup to stop and start the stop of starting to stop the starting sequence of stopping and starting of stopping and starting of the stop in the startup of stopping because mr murray had to remove all planets in the game. he will never stop starting and stop starting to stop starting stoping start wont stop so the start kept starting and stopping and starting again and stopping angain and start stop start stopping start and stop start stopping starting of the starting and the stopping and the murray  would tell me to be quiet and then he would stop starting then it crashed.PLEASE... ANY HELP WOULD DO FOR A LITTLE BOY WHO ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY!"
1	 this game is superior in every way."
1	All you need in life is an egg :)
1	 and it's only gonna get better from here so I'm stoked.Update: 37 hours in.. They have come out with two updates. The first one fixed the 21:9 issue so now I can play on 2560x1080 proper.. Second update has greatly helped the server desync lag issue. Love that the devs are updating so quickly. The game is amazing. Hands down my favorite game already.."
1	 making it easier to see what you have/what you need-Optimization (being worked on)Would totally recommend this game even in its current state. Loads of fun if you like the genre."
1	Starving to death and all i have is this can of Ravioli bur no can opener... 10/10
1	 give it a few months to stabalize and update."
-1	 but then again i spend 8 hours at a time playing while he comes on for an hour or two each day"
1	Can crap on anything. Can't ask for any thing else.10/10.
1	I was stomped on by a robot... 8.5/10No but for real this is what DayZ should've been.
1	please keep up the good work love your game
1	 for me."
1	 the devs follow through to this games shining potential.10/10 Would hate again."
1	 but already it's a great game."
1	BOYS you need to chill is the first version on game withc means IT'S IN DEVELOPMENT . I want to say it's fair to buy and the game will be increased day per day. Now for the people who say that it simialr to ARK and DayZ DUDES is behind the same logic of gameplay . BTW  the devolopers will add vehicles in 1-3 weeks and farming system and more . They have 50 developers who they are working every day and up to 100 others who they have up to 15 years in developnig . BUY THE GAME WORTH
-1	This is the definition of a garbage early access game
1	 Keep going .This game with friends will become abit eazy .One thing i hate KOS on this game some player like to shot on site  but i dont and like to add RP in game on the future ."
1	Probably the best early access launch to date
1	[F] SearchNo items found!
-1	 and a chance of life after death"". When the real premise to the game should be ""Both fan favourites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of one-shot goodness while battling mechs for the support of....zombies?""Where the *#$( did the zombies come from and why are you hiding all the awesome stuff behind a wall of mechs? Let us fight!I mean if we can find one another that is..."
-1	The game is crushing after a while. I've refound it.
1	Better than when DayZ Standalone released
1	Fantastic start to what has to be one of the best Early Access games on the Market. RIP Miscreated and Day Z. This is the real deal when it comes to Survival Games... enjoy guys.
1	funneed a nasa pc tho
-1	Dosent even work just lags and bugs 5 seconds into the game it crashes
-1	 survival game. Right when you start to like the game you hit an end to the content. There is barely enough items to get about 2 hours out of the game. Which is unfortunate because I would have returned it then. Now it has to sit in the pile of games that are unfinished and unplayable. With the rate at which all these games develope I will have a playable game within the next 5-10 years. But hey! if you like to tirelessly read updates logs just waiting for the perfect moment it's worth playing again this game is for you. If not I couldn't recommend it."
-1	 its definitely in early access. It was just simply boring and very ""unfinished""."
1	 and it looks like they devs are focusing on optimizing the games before adding more shiny weapons."
1	Much Love <3Some much potential and its already running good with amazing graphics!
1	This is a great game already so it gets me excited to think about whats to come!!! I would definitely recommend this game!!!
1	It's like if Miscreated and PUBG had a baby and their baby made out with The Forest and created SCUM.  Very well polished for an EA game. It has working features that other games have tried in years of development to implement them and never managed to. Love every asspect of the game !
-1	 if you spawn at the opposite side of the map. I'm Requesting a refund. because I am unwilling to waste an hour of time to run across an empty map dodging zombies just to return to my squad.. if the devs don't fix this .. their game will die just like DAYZ did."
1	 you almost need to spawn in a high pop area to be able to have alot of action.its worth a try for sure."
-1	 looked in all of them tand the only thing to loot was a pair of shorts.I'll revisit this in 6 months when things get better."
-1	absolutely terrible game.
1	Peed on my mates head and took a dump in his shelter. 10/10 game.
1	 great price - but it needs some optimization and the servers need to stop lagging. Lag is the main problem as i see it right now.But definately worth it. And great with a friend!"
1	Game has extreme potential.
1	 with no way to report them instantly.UPDATE:  They have addressed the cheater issue.  Since the update I have not seen this issue and it no longer plagues hours of play.  Changing review to ""Recommend"" now!"
1	this game is more complete on day 1 than dayz is after 4 1/2 years.
-1	 fps low and servers are trash. Im out bai."
1	 haters be hatin."
1	Watches lots of Twitch on game before buying .. everything looks like a great replacement for some other outdated games that dev's stopped progressing on .. can't wait to play more.
1	best survival experience at this moment!i love that game!P.S. RIP DAYZ :3
1	BEST GAME EVERRR
1	 and the game play seems pretty smooth. a few bugs are still present but thats a given with Early Acess. some fetures still locked off.  if you enjoy games like Rust or DayZ your youna enjoy this. excited to see where this goes."
-1	 stutters/freezes every 10 sec wich makes it unplayable"
1	Not that bad. If they gonna fix the servers the game gonna be perfect.
-1	bad frame rates no servers for sea region
-1	Can't actually play the game properly cause the server list is broke.  Will update when fixed.
-1	The game is not fun.Sorry.
-1	no 21:9 support. refunded. no thanks
1	 and log back in to find that I have lost a couple of minutes of progress. What an interesting game though!"
-1	Lying devs giving false keys out trolling the steam forums and general childish behaviour not a good look Gamespires and the discord team ..Constant Crashes joining servers .. no filter on server list which fool decided to release this in this state ? Too many bugs too list Seriously i wouldnt even bother !
1	 runs perfect and I've had a great experience so far."
1	 vitamins (if your casual you can just get away with eating and drinking and not be effected terribly) Try it for yourself its only $20 XD. Its the Dayz That will be finished someday! :D"
1	Best scrolling for server simulator ever!
-1	Failed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectFailed to connectEZ
-1	 been trying for 30 minutes and having to create a new character everytime."
1	OK I wait this game 2 years to come out ... and finally is here .. one of the best survival games ever made !!! Highly recommended ... awesome game for one group of friends to have fun on some server !!! In this game whole metabolism system make this game so special than others survival games.
-1	 and zombies save your money"
-1	New anticheat kicks linux players
-1	 and good luck finding anything anywhere."
1	 even in this early stage.Looking forward to all the features that the devs want to add in the next couple of months!"
-1	 you can search 20 plants in a garden and maybe find 3 items that dont even do anytning. do not buy this game."
1	Bloody amazing game!!
1	I highly recommend this game REMEMBER it is early access.
-1	 lag or cheat idk. The server i was on had a ping of 29 so no idea why lag is so bad.Also 21:9 users stay away larg parts of menus and map cant be seen because they are cut off."
-1	 there is nothing to do beside running and looting ( non interesting things ) and fighting some very clumsy zombies . I hope the devs will add something do to very soon because at this stage is like a running simulator . IMHO they should not have realeased the game yet because atm is actually empty ."
1	 and when is too much. The Zombies are fast as hell though and avoiding them can be a task and risk but getting past that is cool as well. For survival game I would recommend this game to anyone in to this genre of games."
1	 have fun."
1	Love It
1	 the shooting is pretty good too not the best but good."
1	 me neither."
1	 beacause when the game get more updates and more content i see (maybe not) the price getting bigger."
-1	 go buy Miscreated instead."
1	 looking forward to more."
1	Monster & Robots rubber bandging- No notification for patch restarts and rollbacksCrafting/Cooking+ Good crafting system so far.- Crafted item's like fireplaces get placed randomly.- Don't show that the meat is cooking and if the meat is done.-This review is not finished yet-"
1	 it is in early access. I have a lot of fun playing this and it is even better when playing with friends."
1	10000 times better than DayZ. I just hope they fix the problems with cheaters....
1	Got killed while pooping. 10/10 would poop again
1	 friend or foe.Easily worth the money."
-1	no
1	  and optimize that graphic some time have fps drop and freezing that is all but is a great idea beter than dayz"
1	 it has the great ideas and features.It is going to do well!"
1	good :)))
-1	 - DayZ isn't this bad."
1	 and bring us SCUM in all it's glory!"
1	Fills a void in my gaming life :)
1	Very fun game with friends... can only get better from here and its already alot more fun than most survival games out there!
1	wow
1	great game :-}
1	 never heared of it..."
1	Everything you ever wanted Dayz to be.
-1	I would wait a bit before buying this unless you are a hardcore gamer into the survival genre and you want to support the development of the game. They released it far too early. Too many bugs. Including desync in multiplayer that makes combat rarely go well. You need to play such a big map with 64 players but when you try to you can't hit anybody as they keep teleporting due to desync. As the game is still bare bones there isn't enough to do to make up for it. This game has great promise but I think releasing it now was a mistake. Basic is ok but not basic and broken. Even when they get around to sorting out the issue people are going to be a bit over it.

1	Addictive and fun game AIRFIELD always PVP bruh gooooooo
-1	<REFUNDED>this game needs a lot of work still .for now it's no go.
1	best survival game
-1	garbage
1	I'd be happier if the dang mechs didn't have X-Ray vision!
1	+Not PUBG+Original +Less 13YO boys than RUST+Beautiful -No 4k support yet-No vehicles yetWould be nice if stamina was increased until vehicles are introduced.
1	so much damn fun. Basically DAYZ but 5x better. super optimized and although there isn't very much content as of right now im sure sticking through the early access portion of this games lifecycle will prove fruitful as the developers seem to care about the playerbase and what we want. Some small amount of DeSync issues. but presumeably that will be fixed soon enough. Gameplay-wise if you enjoy FPP/TPP survival hyper realistic games this is for you. I hope that with time this game will become one of the greatest survival games ever!!!
1	 a good reason to playALL of thease features i would say would turn this game that i have already had a complete blast with into a great game and please if the devs could see this all i have to request is that they dedicate ALL of thier resources to thease fixes (that and netcode and fps that they keep talking about) because honeslty i couldent care less right now about other stuff that may be sort of cool and im sorry but the devs are going to have to face the reality that the popularity of thier game is slowly (very slowly) dwindeling and if they want to keep them there the community needs something to work forand THAT is the reason at least me (and im sure plenty of others) have really been slowing down on the playtime recently (that and the fact my friend lost all my good gear to a guy with a rock yesterday)stil good game tho please improve!"
1	 I would highly recommend this game."
-1	No items found -_-
1	 I'd say it's a solid 7/10."
-1	Scum looks very impressive sounds pretty good not sure how the game play is due to bad connection but what i did experience was o.k zombies sound weird thought wild boar was near(FOOD) but got consumed by zombies....they are impossible to take out if your loaded and ready to rumbull are there any guns in the game seems they don't i haven't found one!!! pitch fork and baseball bat is the best i could find in the 50 or so buildings i searched the floor plan of the building's got abit boaring more food could've helped or even animals to eat got to the big concrete wall just to be told i was going to die if i went any further thougt that was bit cheap more zombies or robocop bots guarding that boundary or mounting big guns to wall would  be better. $20 great starting price looking forward to seeing if it gets better or boring.
1	 this is epic. -Ben Shapiro"
1	 but dont forget it is still early acess and developers are working with their comunity if it is twitter reddit or other medium... now .... back to game ... bye :D"
-1	 want my 20 bucks back . Last time I buy early access rubbish"
1	This game is nothing but brilliant. It's still growing with updates as well which is amazing. I think they plan to bring base building and vehicles to the game soon which will be nothing but an improvement. the game is a polished DayZ and Mistreated. The only thing that really needs fixing is the Dsync which i believe will be fixed soon enough. I can't wait to make a RolePlay server on this. Discord to my server that is currently in the making is https://discord.gg/M7AmXCM  The release date is yet to be confirmed but will be soon.
1	 it just cannot be explained any simpler."
-1	SCUM is basically DayZ that is purported to run better and look better. It took me an entire day just to make it work and only about an hour to see how little there was setting it apart.
1	SpawnedFound damAccidentally fell off a damRespawned at prisonWatched a man get gunned downRan for his lootScreeched like a girl while being shot atThis convinced my friend to buy10/10 would play this better dayz
1	Took a poop good game
-1	Running Simulator 2018.
1	Graphic is fine. But soo hard to find bullet.
1	its like day z
-1	Another crap game. Another waste of 20$. DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY!
1	 if your into that sort of thing you'll love this game"
1	i really like this game ... bright future .. i never enjoy survival game like this :D
1	yeah it fun but too new to give proper review
-1	i wanted to refund  because of the bad optimization and lack of south american servers.but the game keept on runing in the background or something and now its says i played for 4 hours and i only played for half an hour. Shady tactic i guess the name of the game fits the developers
1	 and a huge open world map. All of this and it has only been on early access for less than a week!"
-1	I cannot refund game because game will not stop running i it wont show up in task manager and it wont show up i turn off my pc and it still runs idk what to do but i have like 15 hours when i really got 47 min
1	 most players have a mic and the interaction with the enviroment and the world and character go to major exstents and realism. <3"
-1	 some random Chinese hacker will teleport to your back and will kill you. (How do I know they are chinese? cause there nicknames are in chinese!)"
1	good but fix lag of servers
-1	Was really exited about this game but its broken. I know its early access but just letting people know its not worth the $20 as it. Cheaters everywhere people just blink into exsistance an kill you. PVP is not possible becuase the loot is so low its not possible to find anything. Another hyped up surviaval game that is more of the same.
-1	 dont make renting a server a thing pretty stupid. so yes and no on this game"
-1	 and have 800 Down 30 Up speeds. So it's the game."
-1	 and I'm willing and still playing the game heavily even though I have so many negative opinions about it.TLDR; Don't purchase the game just yet. Let them fix the bugs and issues before investing."
1	I tried playing the game for almost 2hours and it was fun and exciting and sometimes scarybut I decided to get a refund because of the following:- FPS drop is insane and my 1060 can't barely handle the game- People teleporting even @ 50msI will still give it another chance once they've optimized the game for poor PC specs users
-1	 but i went through 5 different bases and the big robots aren't exactly difficult to avoid."
-1	 might come back after this game is a little more optimized."
1	 I put one in his brain.10/10"
-1	prity much day z
-1	 and at least an hour to go up and down or across. TL;DR - Save your money for now and wait unless you know you are committed to this game and the time it takes to invest into it."
1	Pretty cool game.
1	 but it is 10x better."
-1	boring af
-1	 but having to log out every 5 minutes because items glitch out and i cant move or pick them up... i harldy consider that playable. and dont even get me started on the combat mechanics that are more broken than shattered glass."
1	 detect when you are behind them and 180 headshot you. When you try to bait them far off so your team can run behind them (a good distance off with trees and boulders blocking the line of sight) they still 180 headshot them and kill them after an hour of looting a base. MECHS ARE BROKEN AND OP PLEASE NERF."
1	Very fun game. Needs some work but very playable right now the game is also in EA so could still be features coming online. So much to explore and run from!
1	 but they're always on the other side of the map and I have no way to get to them."
-1	I dont care about hackers and anti hacks i'd rather run into a hacker once in awhile than every gun fight i get into have someone lag around a corner spraying with an ak 2ND thing get rid of the mechs theyre usless and they decrease performance zombies or puppets are good enough they are just really annoying and every gun fight you get into at the air field has to be inside pretty much 3RD thing get rid of the not being able to see people in 3rd person its super glitchy and feels really bad in combat when someone pops up out of nowhere if people dont like 3rd person they can play 1st person servers 4TH the games fps isnt to bad but the stutters are really bad and happens almost 100 percent of the tme when someone pops up because of the line of sight feature and once again makes combat feel super clunky other than all of that this game has ALOT of potential and i love alot of the other features like the crafting system inventory sytem and i love the fact that you can throw knives into peoples heads and kill them instantly
1	Aye lak twas gud n all dat
1	 vice versa"
1	I actually quite enjoy this game I like the content that's in the game now and I'm really happy with what the road map for Content thats coming
-1	 and leaves me feeling very bored."
1	 I reccomend."
1	 and will be even more awesome in the future. Who doesnt get this game is 12 years old virgin i call it right here."
1	 and new features/items. I'm really looking forward to using vehicles like cars and perhaps helicopters! Some more weapon customization/attachments would be nice too."
1	 and the maps are GIGANTIC! Having said that. It does behove you to create both. You'll need them for extended playing. You're going to die at first. A LOT! Just take a deep breath and respawn. You can go get your loot from your dead body. Provided no one got to it first. Good luck!"
1	 most in depth survival games i have played so far and i really enjoy it and reccommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games.Also you can put a knife in your boot. 8/10"
1	DayZ but actually worth it
1	 most thrilling game i played in forever"
1	Cant get enough!
-1	 I can see this being a brilliant game."
1	 there is a lot of possibilities of crafting/combining and so on)-Game needs a decent ammount of optimization to run smoothly-Obviously very early in development-Needs vehicles!"
1	For a Early Access release this has alot promise. So far i had a great time with it even tho we are missing alot of features and content.Now it's time to let the devs do their job and optimize and add content.
1	hehe i like it ;- )
1	.
-1	In short: wait until the game has reached a further state of development and judge again. Right now the game is not worth it unless you are really looking for a DayZ 2.0 with a high likelyness of lagging and stuttering due to poor optimization.+ Good graphics+ Crafting (tho at the moment it's a bit  underwhelming as military loot is too easy to obtain)+ Extensive digestion system (got shot in the head while taking a crap)+ Zombies/Puppets feel more threatening than in DayZ unless you are loaded up with guns- Bad optimization (in my case on a high end PC it runs very poorly and is unplayable due to stuttering every 5 to 10 secs)- If you want your own server you'll have to pay for it (NO private hosting)- If you're not based in western Europe you might have a very bad connection as the only available servers are based in the UKThe gameplay itself is very playable and if you experience no performance issues and can join servers without having any lag you'll be fine but beware that the risk of you having either of those issues is very likely.From me a thumbs down as the game runs like sh*t and we can't host our own servers without having to pay for it.
1	 there's enough stuff in this game to make it worth $20 in fact i'd pay more.- Play with friends- 7 days to die style looting/crafting (very detailed)- zombies to kill- excellent graphics- You can attach barb wire to a bat and feel like Negan when you kill zombies- Giant map that will take you forever to exploreThese are just early first impressions the game has potential to surpass nearly every other survival game but it's not there yet.I rate it 8.5/10 for now though i'm sure the game will improveWatch out for the giant Mech Assault things they will end you.."
1	Best survival game
1	 which I haven't had in years."
1	It's fun
1	 the lack of content screams potential. lets see what happens."
1	 only have 1 gun i can load because magazines are more valuble than anything.10/10 would spend 5 minutes trying figure out how to load a gun again."
-1	 thus sapping all the joy and fun out of a multiplayer session with friends.At the current state the game also has intense memory leak and is not recommended for people having less than 16GB RAM."
1	 definitely interested in seeing how the devs keep up with the game's popularity."
1	 this game has so much potential if they were to add a building aspect and to improve the servers. Thankyou so much for making this game it is an absolute GEM! :)"
-1	stupid dev go learn how to code u idiotss
1	 looks like more crafting options will be added plus vehilces at some point as during character ceration it does show greyed out driving skills."
1	Perfect survival game ever made
-1	Too many performance issues to be fun in its current state. I'd recommend waiting a bit. Good communication from developers during the whole process of the lag fiesto but yeah.. just hold off - I would also be inclined to change my review to positive if I seen improvements but for a game i waited so long for I just feel left disappointed.
-1	 I just can't give it a thumbs up right now."
-1	 just costs less. Bravo."
-1	 otherwise... nah."
1	 if only the right mouse click would slow the gameplay a bit so i can shoot zombies easier.- Yesterday got dc-ed from the server and lost my 15min gameplay with place and items - I would like if there were more items spawnedSo far the game is great and looks really promising! Keep up the good work"
1	 vitamins and minerals; however this hasn't killed the fun for me yet. The hardcore survival genre is for a very specific audience so there will be plenty of negative reviews as well."
1	 that thing will see you if you just peek at it"
-1	 not recommended sorry SCUM."
1	 really good! This game is the last nail in the coffin for dayz!"
1	ANYONE WHO GOT A 1050TI OR LOWER   DONT BUY TTHIS GAME upgrade TO A 1060
1	OMG the greatest game ever made.... I'd def buy this a million times if i had the money.....
-1	 this IS a repeat of dayz standalone."
1	Some techincal issues and stuff like that. but a sweet game overall. It is EARLY ACCESS afterall.
-1	on stream and youtube i was  very excited about this game but now playing it i think it laks a survival aspect no base building no grinding just go to airfield and ur geared
-1	 nothing. It's been a while since I've seen something designed so badly."
-1	 has a lot of potential. Sadly not enough time went into its development to have a smooth launch."
1	promising
-1	 in cities the game starts dropping frames kinda like DayZ did. on the plus side the game has potential but im gonna stay away from it untill more updates"
1	nice game
1	 however I'm only seeing potential of what could be. pls keep it up k"
1	Dope AF!
-1	 oh the server crashed. It's an extremely boring game."
-1	This game ... like it's name ... Is pure SCUM .
1	 they are working on it. Game itself has potential and at it's current stage it's somewhat playable if you can tolerate below 50fps. I just hope it won't end up like DayZ."
1	Finally a strong suvival focused game!  Jumped straight into singleplayer to get a feel for the game as I wait for the servers to settle. The game so far has impressed me. The crafting and survival systems are refreshing!Keep up the hardwork!
-1	 thanks"
1	pretty good can't wait to see what they add! Great game so far!
1	 Ark(ish) and H1Z1. Next generation survival game.This game as early access should be double the amount of money its asking for."
1	This game has been a lot of fun already looking forward to playing many more hours. The devs have been great about pushing update and fixes that are common with an EA game.
1	 just go to a military base and get good gear. I recommend due to potential."
1	 great survival. Finally a game that fixed the third person"
1	 I already know they are working on many additions to the game"
1	 yesterday I made a fire ring beside my camp and this morning it is not there anymore. I though that the fire ring was a fire that I would just have to ignite beside my camp not to rebuild everytime. Why search for rocks to make a fire ring if the improvised fire have the same effect."
1	 knock or fall you have. Other than that love the game and would reccomend and a good price as well!Also love how everyone that left a negative review has disabled comments."
-1	 but needing to put items in different screens is a lesson in frustration.-Story line/goal/destination. Game seems sort of pointless.-Needs vehicles.  The traveling is boring and tedious.-Desperately needs more house models/zombie models/character features/etc.."
1	 cause it wont be."
-1	i couldn't install english language in my region  and i refunded game. Bc I don't want lose my time in search solution technical problems in web.
1	Better than real life  XD
1	 post it on a forum and stop ruining this beautiful games reputation."
-1	 not the best."
-1	Just a DayZ rip off with added features
1	Its like reliving DayZ mod. Except this one gets updated more frequently and has a future planned out.
1	 dies to blood loss 10/10 would got hunting again"
1	Add more cities or make the current ones bigger with more tall buildings. And for God sake fix the aiming system in this game. But overall the game is great.
1	This is the game I been waiting for 5 years ago when DayZ was a thing still. It is EA still so not everything is implemented in the game yet but as the game is now its still really fun and enough things to do to keep it entertaining till updates with base building and vehicles are implimented. I would wait if you want a full game. Right now its a walking simulator when it comes to traveling across the map to team up with a friend.
1	 already ontop of anti-hacking updatescant wait to see what they bring to the table!"
1	Pefect mix of complex survival mechanics but with quality of life improvements that means death does not mean hours of your life to get back on your feet or back with your squad. Not to mention the game is beautiful. Can't wait to see what the future of this game holds. Got my 20 bucks worth already
-1	 its funBut when you play on a private server and the server admin spawns you items and you triggers the anticheat and you get perm banned. Submitted an appeal to EAC review and dissmiss the ban. Will update if ban gets removed. This is a HUGE flaw in the game."
1	 game on!"
1	 pick this up if you have $20 lying around. I can see myself playing this game for a long time so as long as the devs continue to add content and more things to do. Parts List for Reference 8700K OC'd to 4.3ghz1080ti16gb 3200mhz ram"
-1	 for now desync Simulator"
-1	It was slow and boring.Not all all what its hyped to be.
-1	 easily defeated by line of sight and doors.I had a good time initially and had fun but there's a lot to be desired. Maybe one day I'll revisit the game because the world is really beautiful and interesting but with Fallout 76 around the corner... I doubt I will."
1	 peepee and poopoo."
-1	 it was released like 4 days ago..."
1	You can s-.-h.-i.-t. and p-.-i.-s.-s. in this game  10/10
1	 unlike Dayz."
1	For early access this is the most fun i have had with a game! Cannot wait to see what they end up adding
-1	 thanks"
1	 but I think that both games can coexist together. Thumbs up."
1	I like it
-1	This game did not live up to the hype. Very disappointing. I really do hope it improves over time.
1	Very promising survival/pvp game. First game I have been excited to see how it develops in a long time!
1	 and for the price you really get a nice game."
1	discord etc... PROD TO BE CROAT!"
1	 getting to know it takes time."
1	Very promising game. Runs smoothly now after a couple of days from launch. Many nice ideas that the devs just need time to implement. Will be the best survival game out there once they get going.
1	 keep up the good work Highly recommended"
1	 not pure BR PVP."
-1	 because the game is really cool. I feel like I'll just have to go spend thousands of dollars on an amazing pc to enjoy playing anything lol. Sorry...I get kind of salty with pc gaming being such a pain in the a**."
1	 the biggest 2 being robot/mech damage towards players and client side lag"
-1	 it's complete and total vaporware in its current form."
-1	was behind the box and the other guy got spooted and then it started to shoot me....GG"
1	Great game. Smooth launch. There are buggs but they will be ironed out.
1	 turns out the server was munted so we connected to another one which i spent an hour looting to the point where i got my first gun.It was pretty exciting looking through empty buildings and walking around empty towns to then be killed by a hacker who teleported to me twice to kill me.Here's a video of it: https://youtu.be/pykpfCD8qFs"
-1	 avoid like the plague unless you enjoy someone with 500 ping teleporting behind you without speaking your language"
1	RIP DAYZ!!! Even in its infancy this game is more than dayz has ever had or offered....and I love it!! If you think this review is crap go look at my hours in dayz standalone and arma 2 combined operations (mod days). This is everything epoch mod was and more I cant wait to see this games development as I'm already happy. 30$ (Canadian lol) well spent!
1	 When you and your buddy are in a group we should be able to see our groups arrows so we can get to them easier.(Only in a group setting though)12. Show a char pane for when your in groupI love this game and as long as it keeps going in the direction it is and not just turn into a BR with no need for survival or pve. I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT THIS GAME HOLDS IN THE FUTURE"
-1	 will be good when later but not now"
1	- Sodium over 3000%- Still Alive- Got killed by a goat while pooping10/10 would poop again
1	 second one not as much but its getting kinda annoying"
-1	In short? The newest forumlaic trash with a fitbit.they hit the sweet spot  with the 20 dollar price.   50/50 shot if i would have kept it and not refunded.  They screwed it up when they went back on thier word about dediciated server support.  If i buy it I want to host it myself.
1	 And this is the first time I have seen devs actually deliver on promises. Hopefully they can keep it up!"
-1	 you better have above an average cooling solution."
1	 the game has improved ten fold in the short amout of time its been out and im sure will continue to get better and better. Awesome game guys. I'd buy it again."
1	 I have used zombies as a means to relieve myself of hostile individuals. I've been ranting on about H1Z1 not having similar capabilities for years!My last point is that this game has so much potential. All of the skills and nutritional jazz are artifacts of just that. I truly cannot wait to see what is implemented in the future."
-1	the hell with this game servers were wiped when new patches deployed
1	SCUM = P E R F E C T
-1	The game is poor
-1	 this game is simply not fun."
-1	This game sucksso far...
1	 but the concept was cool enough to get my support and the game itself is playable.... for the most part."
-1	 who in the world thought it was a good idea to implement that into a game... about killing people... I guess it does add reasons not to KOS.Not terrible. Not great. Lots of lag. Patches make lag worse. Can't recommend in current state."
1	 closest thing to what dayz was before devs ruined it :)"
-1	not worth $20. worst $20 spent in my life.
1	It's pretty good
1	 it has a solid feel.  The devs have a great line of communication with the community.  They seem to be ambitious and hard working.  I have high hopes."
-1	this game is not good
1	 do not store any items in SP. as currently there is a bug that deletes stored items and crafted boxes.At 20$ i'd say that it is worth it as it currently stands. Just remember to eat a side of veggies and mushrooms with your friends leg."
-1	 still a lot to fix. but explain me somethin. how do they expect someone to survive when you can't have a decent fight because connection sucks"
1	 but want more 'direction'."
1	 And team deathmatches you can jump into.   You dont lose your gear when you jump into any of the special game modes.  Devs are fixing problems imediatley after they are reported.  Best early access experience i have ever had.  I am recomending this game to all of my friends."
1	getting better & better. early access leaves a very promising basegame. hoping the devs can expand on the solid gameplay.
1	Its good.
1	 for once we have a game that isint just deathmatch with hunger.. It's already great in its current state (First week of early access) and can only go up from its current state. well worth the price."
1	 with literally nothing except a knife - running after a poor bastard to kill him because I need his jacket and pants.10/10 would recommend this game"
1	full release is is scheduled for 2019 so until then we cant complain to much."
1	 so do not expect a fully completed game with content and performance like an official 1.0 release. (The game haven't even been out for a week yet) The devs seems really devoted and are listening to the community. ( They even dropped a patch fixing bugs just 2-3 days after release.) Hopefully the devs will optimize performance and net code. Then this game will be awesome."
1	 this gem will be a genre king."
1	Eating cornflakes and butter until i puke my guts up in a cupboard.Best real life simulator ever.
1	Ignore the cry babies
1	 you can do parkour and its realistic you get skinny or fat and this is awesome zombies are fast and you have to be very careful. 8/10"
-1	If you consider playing this game with a 1050 ti good luck
1	 and the developers seem to be more than on it with updates and communication."
-1	 i realy hope some improviments for the future.and... fix for the online multiplayer mode."
1	it just needs a bit of love and careConcept 8/10 Gameplay 3/10 Difficulty 2/10 Boringness 10/10"
1	Health and Canibalism simulator.For those having framerate issues try using -sm4 in the launch options.
-1	 zombies glitch through small airport hangar walls.  Needs work hope they can polish this turd."
1	 it's pretty addicting not to mention it's only 20 bucks."
1	still better than DayZ XDDD
-1	 it's gonna die as fast as it came out"
1	So far so good. Much more playable than Dayz.
-1	smells like cheese
-1	 the luanch of SCUM seems to put my card on overdrive? (the fan turns on aggresively) and all video output halts but sound still comes through. Even after an unistall and reinstall and its updates the game continued to act in this manner. As it is now i cannot recommend this game."
1	Not bad for first week in EA. This game has alot of potencial.
1	 just burned out on it."
1	I've only played the single player so far and I really like it. It takes a while to learn how to craft and survive but once you get going its a lot of fun exploring and looting. There's so much detail in this game that I can tell a lot of love has been put in to it.I have a 1050ti and an AMD A8 6600k. Which some sites told me would not even achieve the minimum specs. So far the game runs not too bad (30-40fps on epic) but every now and then I get lagg spikes when entering a new town(dunno if thats my CPU or the game optimization).
-1	 PVP is a desync lottery...which kinda kills the fun!Fix this issue and it has the potential to become one of the best survival games out there."
1	 its bloody amazing"
1	 think the game will be more fun then."
-1	 crashes and run out of things to do."
1	 or several other things they plan on adding (better crafting and medical system)."
-1	 melee is a joke. It's really just not worth paying for at the moment. I played for about 12-13 hours and I wish I hadn't even wasted my time. All it has left me with is a bitter taste in my mouth."
-1	Pls fix ur servers...
-1	 will be following the game to see how it improves as it has great potential."
-1	i dont recommend this its super hard to get stuff i played it for 2 hours and i couldnt find 1 gun and i only found 1 bullet and 1 gunpowder and the zombies are OP they almost kill you instantly and they are super fast so they hunt you down in 1 second and if you search for some hours you MAYBE can find a shovel
1	All these negative reviews have to be competing dev's or something because this game is legit for an early access. I'm a few hours in and already like it more than the failed DayZ standalone. Now that game was a cash grab. Keep up the good work on this game. It has the potential to be great.
1	"What DayZ standalone should have been. The large number of stats along with the ""metabolism"" feature make every player character unique and each have their own weaknesses depending on how they eat and treat their body. A great survival game so far. Can't wait to see what happens over the next couple years."
1	 lockers etc...i think having bases will make this game so much better."
1	 this game will be lots more fun. Worth the 20 dollars"
1	 and its fun with friends as well !"
-1	 or run around with a stick. There is no inbetween."
1	"The ""item not found"" and running simulator. 10/10 would not buy again."
1	 a decent crafting system and a very small learning curve."
1	 but still not a lot to do... i don't see anypeople all the hours that I have ive only seen 2 people and both of those times they were lagging everywhere and were impossible to hit"
-1	 its EA it will get better......."
-1	 or rounds in the same location. This game is time consuming and lacks reward when hunting for resources and equipment endlessly for no real reward. I wasn't impressed. I may revisit closer to release but not for now."
1	Best $28 I've spent on Steam.  Amazing so far.. Can't wait to see how far this goes. Way more advanced than DayZ Standalone in every way. The fighting system is on point along with the crafting diversity. Now if these games could just fix micro-lag :) lol   5 Stars
1	 we just have to wait ultill they fix a lot of things."
1	 and what direction they are taking it. I would HIGHLY reccommend this game if you enjoy the old school survival shooter type. I'm very excited to see future updates."
1	 other game developers would have let something like this slide til they felt it was necessary. BIG UPS! #RIPDAYZ"
1	 bringing updates on sunday for us haha."
1	 but don't buy it if you're not okay with a fairly slow pace and quite a lot of running."
-1	 Hold onto you pennies and wait for updates."
1	Long live developers. Detailed review will be written soon.
1	 and the multi needs some work (choppy lag and more to discuss... )..  i will still recommend this game - so long as the game will load!"
-1	This game like a walking and looting simulator...
1	 not too expensive and has massive potential. The developers are very active and listen to the community and what they want for the game. I think that it will become a hugely popular and enjoyable multiplayer game in the near future. 10/10"
-1	 i can't recommend this.   Potential =/= good game."
1	 those will most likely be handled in the future. Would recommend!"
-1	I like the game but can't recomment it until they fix the cheating and hackers.
-1	poo
1	 looking promising if they continue to patch & update alot of stuff."
1	Like the potensial of this game.  they need get some more Self owned buildable bases ASAP. Staying tuned so owerall so far so good =)
1	Friend pooped in front of me so I peed on his head.10/10
-1	 then i say the game is well worth the money to play it. If you cannot then bypass this game until the dev's get things undercontrol.If you can deal with the wipes: 8/10If you cannot deal with the wipes: 2/10"
1	Awesome.
1	 I release - Madao comes in the way and dies.I then urinate on his body.11/10 would gift to a friend."
1	10/10 Would die of starvation again
-1	barely even a game
1	great game
1	 lots of potential. Just needs more crafting! And be able to move / place objects where you want them"
1	Can defecate wherever and on whoever 10/10
1	honestly ... this has so much potential. i can see myself getting lost in this game when it gets more updates. right now its kinda dry (expected) but if the devs really work and give scum the love and attention it deserves this game could easily overtake pubg/fortnite if it goes to console (hopefully). 7/10 (for now...)
1	great game
-1	A running simulator without auto-run.
1	So far so good. I really like the movement in and out of buildings. Besides the occasional lag spike due to rendering map I have no issues. I enjoy playing the game windowed for better performance.
1	 ""zombie survival"" game.but would you expect anything less?"
1	 but it is not the final version of the game.    Give it a chance...you will like it."
-1	 I will be refunding my purchase just to be safe."
-1	 so you have to look left look right  about 20 times to just figure out 1 recipe  at current stage i would not recommend this game.  have got refund from steam as many are having the same  problems with it i did."
-1	 PLAY LATER."
-1	 I would not recommend this game in its current state. Sure its EA but you should have released it with some special features to make it stand out more and make it less of a walking simulator. I thought it was funny how people were rating this game before it was even released with praise and positive enlightenment. Man those reviews were wrong thats for sure and probably the only thing going for them. I would avoid those ones."
1	 who don't get good internet in the field. First or Third Person to suit your desire.Being able to cut up and consume your prey as well as cut their clothing into resources(in game of course) tickles my predator instinct.Devs are very active and willing to recreate if necessary.I've got huge hopes for the outcome of this game and feel like I've already got my moneys worth."
-1	The average time it takes to climb a ladder on SCUM is equivalent to climbing 3 ladders in MGS Snake Eater.
1	I pooped on a dead guy. 10/10 would poop on a dead guy again.
-1	Worst game I've ever played. i'd have more fun circumcising myself with a rusty nail.
1	 had some very interesting interactions so far and I haven't played for very long. Been enjoing myself so far."
1	Game looks nice but you canot play whit GTX750 25 fps ..
1	Tried to stab a dude with a bit of stone. Got stabbed instead. 10/10
1	 deer runs away with the spear in its head>mfw left with no spear12/10"
1	i like the game. tobad im only going guarded places cuz thats the only good spot. towns need a little more loot tbh
1	HELLO!
-1	 my first hour of the game is amazing."
-1	 espcially this piece of scum"
-1	terrible optimization. 30fps ...
-1	 but the delivery was poor."
-1	 you're just like the others developers."
1	 I'm sure they will fix it.You got PVP & Solo (pve) options.P.S! after you kill another player you can squat down and take a HOT steaming sh*t in their mouth!"
-1	Too much lag
1	my dream game with single player peace.. Rip dayz..
1	SCUUUUUM GAAAAANG
1	 this is what DayZ should have been 5 years ago. Amazing so far."
-1	not worth it servers not working want a refund
1	 found a cauliflower. Game completed. Didn't expect it to be over so soon!"
-1	 dead and im refunding it"
1	Nice game!
1	Wow day one almost 3k reviews..4hrs some weridos with hate and a refund button.This game we rushed them to put out isnt bad the devs will remain motivated lets be real they made over1mil releae day!!You really shouldn'nt buy EA if you want a compleate exp.$20 im in for all the inovation congratz to the devs keep up the work!!!
-1	No ultra wide monitor support and game runs in windowed mode making UI cluttered as it doesn't scale with the screen. The metabolism immersion isn't as intuitive or deep. Just get all your stuff to green and dont worry about it. Extremely boring after gearing up. Decent game to play with your pals but this is not a revolutionary nor an intervention experience.
1	 i think theres no survival game near this!"
1	Reminds me of the nalstalgic dayz feeling :')
1	If your into open world zombie survival games DO NOT GET DayZ Get THIS.                              And also if you got the extra couple bucks get the Supporter DLC also.
1	Extremely good dev support. However poor 21:9 aspect ratio support but playable.
1	Ray Winstone told me to sayI'm the F@$kin Daddy now....
1	+1
1	Un-Scuffed DayZ. Very Realistic & Well Optimised. Get it Already
1	This game is exactly what i thought it would be; a hardcore survival simulation experience. Devs are very active and listens to feedback.If you don't like walking around for 2 hours trying to maintain a sustainable diet without meeting anyone; this is not for you.
1	i like it well worth the price
1	I met a man named Dirty Mittens and he was shot by a giant mech and i took his stuff. I was then also shot by a giant mech. 10/10 good job devolver.
-1	Don't buy this game.
-1	 even against a skinny zombie can easily get you killed."
-1	 crafting survival and running simulator."
-1	 Conan). Refund request submitted."
1	Throw a 15 kilo sledghammer in the face of the zombie from 10 meters away10/10 would remodel his face again.
1	It's ok but kinda boring right now will probably be more fun when 1.0 comes but I would still buy it now it's only 20$
1	 worth the price. Lets see where it goes."
-1	No australian servers :<
-1	I didnt like that :Good points:-Beautiful landscape-animals-amazing graphic-very big map-lots of crafting things-funBad Points :-Idiot infecteds-no Horror-no lonliness-no darkness-no blood-no scary sounds-just like the others
-1	the game is amazing but the connection been really bad i hate how people teleporting around you have to fix this part otherwise it does not worth what you pay for !!!
1	It can only get better
1	 and on so from what I heard.I personally can't wait to see what the developers will add in next.8.4/10"
1	it cool game i lake how new play style
1	 truly what dayz was meant to be in its ultimate form. You won't regret buying it although in the current Alpha I get 40-60fps all settings low 1440p with a GTX 1080 so if you have a weakish card maybe give it a pass until you upgrade"
1	 keep doing what you're doing. epic."
1	Its the bestest game in the get good world!!!!!!! MY NAME IS JEBUS AND JESUS IS MY DAD!!!!!!!!
1	Good game
1	 can't wait for sailing and piloting personally."
-1	 in the future it'll be better. The servers are kinda choppy as of right now and they're fixing that. It is a beautiful game though. I played 3 hours and returned it due to lack of in game content. But it is an early access game so that's to be expected. Also you can play single player but whats the point of that when there's no story to back it up. Its just another open world survival. I don't think its worth but hey its your money."
1	 this game is much more complete and runs smoother."
1	best homeless simulator
1	Loved this game
1	So far so good!
1	so far so good
1	 fix pvp fix tutorialMAKE THIS GAME GREAT SOON!!"
1	Avoiding Mech Simulator 10/10
1	 injured legs to the recoil from guns.The graphics are so astonishing that my computer couldn't handle it :0I got an average of 30 fps on minimum settings. Rip :(i5-3470GTX 1050 2gb8 gb ram6 fps on epic settings lmao"
-1	 but i would wait intul some of the problems are fixed."
-1	 but i might come back later."
1	 and the server desync when trying to fight someone.If you are looking for a new survival game and/or a game to play with friends for hours on end I HIGHLY recommend this game."
1	 it is not in the least comparable to the rest found on the market excluding Rust. 10/10"
-1	i lag all the time and the game is slow u rarely see anybody
1	GG
1	 with alot of potential.Better than DayzBetter than MiscreatedBetter than 7 Days to DieBetter than any survival game outBetter than your moms fartbox."
1	If you liked DayZ 5 years ago play this.
1	You know a game has you hooked if you prioritize dropping doozies in-game more than you do in real life. 10/10
1	keep it updates SCUM :3
1	stephen hawking runs better
1	 interaction etc.-deep metabolism simulationcons-server issues-unstable performance-fame system needs rework"
1	 and adding content. This game has so much potential to be an absolute unit. I would highly recommend if youre looking for a fun FPS/survival game. Easily one of the best purchases I have made on steam under $30."
-1	 then i could see this game being really fun."
1	Great start to the game. It's only going to get better.
1	 now the game has its bugs but thats to be expected for a Early Access game.Overall 9/10 game great with friends and good game to but some time into :D"
1	 it takes 15 bullets to kill 1 zombie. Plz fix soon this game has alot of potential just alot of bugs rn"
-1	A bland game.. with endless running. To collect all the loot.. just to have it all stolen while youre offline because you cannot build bases in this game.. No way to lock up your inventory. Litteraly its free game for anyone who finds it. even a new player just starting. Needs bulding mode or this game is pointless. 4/10
1	 keep the updates comming and this game will be great."
1	 refund it."

1	Addicted game
1	. So here is my story from inside scum. I was strarving hungry and after i was blasted in the arm by another prisoner on the island i had managed to flee into a nearby wooded area and hide while my prisoner was slowly bleeding to death. I took a small knife i had looted from one of the houses earlier and used it to cut my nice baseball cap into some strips and then used them to dress my wounds. After another hike to a small town near some water i was attacked by a zombie and after smacking it several times in the face it layed doen in front of me. I was now in major need of food now and their was only one real source of food. Must say he tasted better than he looked.
1	Great start to a game with wonderful potential.  I hope the developers don't go down the DayZ rabbit hole.  But this one is already a winner.Find a bed.Pee on it.Crap on it.Vomit on it.Get 2 bottles of Whiskey.  Drink them. Vomit.Find Random mushrooms in forest.Eat them.Vomit.Hallucinate.Crawl through all that mess and fist fight a bear.11/10 Would pee on bear in middle of fight and die.
1	 but it is well on its way."
1	amazing game
-1	 it's a thumbs down from me."
1	 this will be an absolutely fantastic game."
1	 SCUM has a lot of potential. It is engaging and I'm looking forward to seeing it develop further."
1	SpawnedWalked about a forest for a whilethrew crowbar at zombieate its fleshfind townfind watermelonAttempt to eat entire watermelonThrows up and just keels over... DEADrinse and repeat
-1	 overcomplicated (non existant Co-Op) mode."
1	 and taking a massive bowel discharge on his decapitated head."
1	 long way to go but its good fun for 20$!"
-1	 you cant even find half the servers your friends are playing on. WHen you connect through IP it doesn't work. Overall awful game"
1	 not sure about dayz standalone as I haven't played that. Read other reviews for comparisons with that."
1	 but I feel like the foundation of the game is very solid already. Good job so far!"
-1	 so I will. Giving it a thumbs down will show the devs to keep fixing the game. I really hope this game becomes the next big thing."
1	 I can promise you that."
-1	 or you make money out of playing videogames (shroud) then this game is for you."
1	 my computer is well over the recomended specs. and the hit boxes of the zombies are a bit rough. but besides that the game is quite fun and well worth the money!"
1	YES ! VERY GOOD ! Thank you Gamepires for this title.
-1	 unnecessarily large world"
1	kinda like dayz but better
1	 at least at launch!"
1	 it looks good and is more indepth than other survival games.It's early access. Will change based on release"
1	 balancing etclove it so farway ahead of delayz"
-1	Refunded
-1	 until then Day Z would b a better choice"
-1	 game is gonna be dead in 2 weeks max.Thank god I refunded in time."
-1	boring
1	You can get diarrhea in the game.11/10
1	Great game
1	i take back what i said because they fixed a lot of stuff within a hour made a small patch. its ran better since then and played for over a hour with not losing connection had a great time cant wait for new updates on stuff great game i love this game!
1	"There is new KING in the town! It's called ""SCUM"" and his older brother called DayZ can now die! Hahaha"
1	 heehee."
1	Awesome game.its looks cool and it is cool :D
-1	 and that would make this a really solid EA. Get vehicles in with a few more weapons and sights maybe and we have something real special."
-1	 and even bugging so you maybe end losing you character after using time playing.    It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.  I did have a weight on 71kg .  after the bug. i weight a little over 130kg and i got a total new face (skin texture)The game have Big potential . I wont ask for refund. I still belive in the game.  But some Changed and fixed need to be made before i will use my time on it."
1	The fact that you can poop on the people you kill is what sold me on this game 10/10
-1	 But its trash with the buff of robots its rage inducing and has ruined the game. Avoid for now"
-1	is ok
-1	 please"
-1	 so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.Stay far away from this game until these issues have been adressed."
1	The next survival game!hope it will be good.
1	What Dayz wishes it was
1	whats up with the servers
-1	Server browser is from 1995ez refund
1	SCUM is a promising survival game which introduces lots of new mechanics for more realism. At first glance it may look similar to DayZ but imho it has a lot more depth and cool features. Try it out! 10/10 would recommend
1	 Im just here to battle the bad reviews an hour into launch."
-1	 Windows 10Processor: Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD FX-6300Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 2GB / AMD Radeon R7 370 2GBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 20 GB available spaceA very big difference so i just think spending more money on a better game is just the way to go."
1	Can we have more server for Asia ?
1	 1060 GTX 6GB and i5-4690K getting 30-40fps after doing all the things that supposedly raise fps.. no complaints beyond that"
1	Very fun game so far
1	who cares
1	very hard but if you know what to do it seems like alot of fun
1	Awsome refresh on a survial game the devs seam to really care about the game and try to fix bugs very quick in my opinon the devs are really doing great work to make sure this game does not die out of the gate. Plus you can poop on people you kill so it is worth the 20 buck and then some
-1	 but this is not it in my opinion."
1	 the game is fine. Needs a lot of polish but its NOT another Dayz implement. This CAN actually make it."
1	just awesome
1	This game is just a perfect survival game
1	 took a sh*t on his severed head...then came home and played Scum."
1	 but know that this game is out i will be playing this for awhile. I only wish there were a few more animals easier to find. Having a grand time tho."
1	 SCUM is on its best way to become the defacto alpha male among its multiplayer survival peers."
1	 you're gonna be dissapointed. Expect a realistic surviving game and with lots of features not yet available but at a modest price? You're gonna be A-OK"
-1	 but for now its a hard pass."
-1	 cumbersome and generaly not fun"
1	 other then that this game for $20 is a bargain. 9/10 from me :)"
1	 if you can get past dying when you are fully geard."
1	Loving the game just wish i had more freinds to play with. Add me if youre keen to jam some scum!
-1	 I hope it does."
-1	 so i'd advice waiting."
1	decent
1	is there a reason my game play lagging ???
1	 R.I.P DayZ and others"
-1	 and are loaded with irrelevant infoThe amount of work done on measuring a characters metabolism is disgusting."
-1	 broken game. I do not recommend this game."
1	I pooped a delcious beverage. Couldn't ask for more. 5/5.
-1	 lab technician and nurse while trying to avoid zombies and run across the map."
-1	 explore and DIE IN LAGGY PVP. (needs alot of work if they want to keep the game alive)  Thats why i cannot recommend this game but i may change my mind in the future if they manage to fix it."
-1	 strength and melee and I still couldnt take out a zombie with a crowbar. Guns are realistic but too realistic for gameplay."
1	So far so good! Couple of bugs but I know the game wil improve!
1	Great complexity even in its EA state. I hope they dont dumb down things.
-1	 making them invisible. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to have a good and fair pvp fight. I will likely change my review when they fix these issues. I do understand its only in EA but the game should still be kinda playable like most other EA games. I wish good luck to the developers and hope that the game turns into what it has the potential to become."
1	 Jesus i can spend at least 3 hours without eating anything"
-1	 it might be worth it. maybe. (most likely not...)"
1	 DM and Assault-kind.Pretty neat to implement that kind of functions in a game like this."
-1	server suck dickssss
1	The game runs really smooth so far the only problems I have had are with the servers crashing when they are full.
-1	massive hype build up for nothing...rubbish
-1	I can't find any rope
1	 then this is your dream game. This game is worth more than $20 in my honest opinion."
-1	TOTAL TRASH WHY RELEASE A GAME THIS EARLY. ITS TERRIBLE
1	 so I began with single player game to learn mechanics. Waiting for devs to fix the issue. No reason to be angry - this ain't exactly the AAA game."
1	The game is good and i would recommend.  There are server crashes though so be prepared to deal with that.  I'm sure the devs will fix them asap.
-1	"""Couldnt connect to the server"" simulator. PsiSyn scammed me."
1	 supposed  to play with friends for it to be good"
1	RIP DayZ  I have an I7 7820HK and a GTX 1070 65 FPS average but do get some stutters.As of right now the game is missing a lot of content but its promising im loving it
-1	Seemed like a good buy to begin with. Looked fun to play. once in the game servers kept crashing (could be from loads of people joining at once) and it was difficult to find a server that would let you in to begin with (kept getting connection timeouts). There is also no way to join your friends direct unless you have the name or ip of the server. Would reccomend waiting till game has a few new features and patches added (like a friends tab in the servers menu) and servers are stable and allow you to join first time.
-1	I think dung beetles should polish their turds before they roll it around.
-1	Dont buy it cant even connect to a server and its not worth 20$ for how boring it was when playing singleplayer i can only think how bad mulitplayer is
1	it's fun. better then dayz.
1	 looking forward to way more hours."
1	 and is all around fun!"
1	 go for PUBG. This is slower and more methodical gameplay."
1	Good meme.All these people are complaining about a game that is in alpha and they say 'lacks content'. In my opinion that is not a valid reason not to pick up this game because boy does it have content and is it worth the measley $20 that it costs.
1	 may as well be a 10/10"
1	10/10 IGN would bang
1	 PvP needs some work"
1	 aslong as they keep their heart into the dev of this game"
-1	Rush out Chinese
1	The Sims : Hardcore Edition
-1	 how do players cope with this in multi-player? The other thing I wish that could be possible is the ability to play on LAN only. I haven't looked at all at multi-player in anyway simply due to the two issues above. I'd also like to note that there is quite a bit of lag in areas with larger towns/cities. I turned everything down and quite a few things off just to be able to go to those areas and I still lag. I wouldn't recommend this at this point in time. Maybe as time goes on and changes are made I will consider updating my review."
1	We  need chinese!!!
1	AHH  ME CHINESE ME RIKE THIS GAME
1	 and seems further along than DayZ was a year or two after launch."
1	game is good but there is just too much everything lmao
1	yo its fun to play
1	 waiting for new updates!"
1	so far the best survival game in early access
1	 the only real problem I see now is occasional 1 second ""lag"" probably caused by ""memory leaks"" I believe this will be addressed soon though. The rest is a case of minor changes and improvements. Hopefully we get to see some frequent updates improving the experience further. I'm really rooting for this game."
1	50 hours in and tho i've had a few issues with connection drop to servers this game has some great potientiali Hate mushrooms IRL and i have never done so much research on them as i have playing this game The health system looks like you need a medical degree to figure it out but it is quiet simple and easy to get your head around as long as you check it Crafting fairly straight forward easy to do with you having accesss to anything in your immediate vacinity plus whats in your inventory I'm looking forward to future of where this game can go
1	 well you won't find players to kill"
1	 be patient."
1	ye
1	 so theres that."
-1	 just running this is the game for you.Also you cant kill anybody because they teleport on every server even if you have good ping.Bad game on every aspect:-optimization-air animations-map 2 big for 64 players (time 2 kill= 1/2-3 h ? )-useless crafting (backpack and spear only thing you will ever craft)-running simulator (nothing to get you around not even a bicycle)-most of the servers are just bad: animals teleporting no auto kick on hight ping-events feel useless just to keep you from not quiting the gameJust another early acces game who will get better in the ""future""."
1	 instead of playing the game your more so playing the character which is interesting and fun. I literally cant wait for this game to be more optimise and rum smoothly as that would make the game 100x better. right now its smart to avoid gunfights as players are teleporting everywhere."
1	 i like it.spicey aimbot/10"
1	Wiie
-1	Graphics are poor and it's just dreary!
1	 but still easy to understand and pick up on. The events are a great way to combat the boredom that you usually have with running simulators. I can't wait to see where this goes."
1	 not my type of game."
1	Amazing!
1	Good game !!!
-1	Servers are pathetic
1	 pretty solid game"
1	Killed a guy and took a doo doo on em 10/10
-1	Too many performance issues to be fun in its current state. I'd recommend waiting a bit.
1	Lag
-1	bad optimizationlittle content
1	 lighting is nice. The inventory systems UI need a little streamlining.But overall its playable. Looking forward to development and fixes and features to come!"
1	 just don't make it a battle royale. Keep it pure."
1	I already clocked in 15 hours into this game i am looking forward to playing this game more and watching it grow so hopefully the  community stays strong If u dislike it give it a couple mounths developers will be destroying every other survival game out there
-1	 this game will be epic."
-1	 and maybe just maybe if you are lucky you will find a car battery !"
1	Awesome game. Obviously some issues because it is in alpha. But if you have a nice PC you will be fine. Alot of fun graphics are impressive. I would definitely recommend it. The devs have been really involved so far and im excited to see whats to come!
-1	 and no hotdogs."
-1	Beware hackers are everywhere. Huge amounts of d-sync. no anti cheat in such game is the reason you shouldnt buy this game + the D-sync is killing the fun part so at this state i do not recommend buying this game
-1	 not freeze) you can't even get a refund from Steam. It's a total scam."
1	 military areas are very tough because of the robots. And i'm loving it! I hope there will be a dedicated server option in the future to play coop games with friends only without the need to rent a whole server."
1	 I would say it is presently not one to buy unless you want to support the developers. But it is one to add to your wish list as it has a huge amount of potential. + performance is very smooth for a early access title default settings without tweaking were 35 FPS+ Character customisation gives you points to spend on your character+ a food and water system that is balanced!+ Events + resolved issues that other survival games still have problems with today...+ by far one of the most pretty survival games I have seen.All the below negatives are going to be due to early access so I do not blame the developers at all.- Desync is a massive problem at present (to be expected)- browsing for a server needs more functions and filtering- Gun play needs tweaking"
1	 and im not done playing today!"
1	 etc. Bow and arrow would be awesome as a first step"
1	 or CoD it has complex health systems that you must upkeep to survive very intimidating at first but interesting to keep you going after different kinds of loot."
-1	Super boring game. I loot like for 1 hour. see no enemies what so ever. for me this game is just way to slow.
-1	DayZ with an actual digestive system.
1	i played for 12 hours straight help me
1	 which I'm sure they will; they seem pretty determined with this!Give it a shot maybe ya'll! Cheers!"
-1	 with all that being said.. Scum is a breath of fresh air in the Survival genre with lots of room for improvement.. will definitely play it again once more content is added and is fairly optimized."
-1	 once this is fixed i will be back."
1	i love this game best survival game ive ever played i just have one complaint more of a request i was playing on solo player at the air field base in the white hanger next to the 3 military hangers the puppets were pushing eachother through the wall lucky i was paying attention i was in the middle of patching my wounds when i was 3 puppets come in one after another i just killed them looted all the puppet bodies in the hanger and got off please fix this its not the first time ive seen this its happend to me a few times on multiplayer other than that its a beautiful game and i cant wait to see what else you guys will do in the game thank you for putting it on early access -steven richardson
-1	 if you dont enjoy survival games where you run around the map for the entirity of the gameplay with very little pvp i would not reccomend this game. I have refunded the game as i didnt enjoy my 2 hours of playing it."
1	 but almost getting murdered and having all of your gear taken is a rush. Its been a long time since I've gotten those sweaty palms and pit in my stomach from a video game and this one does that for me. For those of you actually interested in an in depth survival game with a persistent world then I hope this will be the game for us. What the devs have planned sounds amazing and if they even get half of it implemented and polished then it'll be the most amazing game on the market. Even with what is probably 10-15% of the game being active at this time its still pretty deep and I'm still trying to figure out the best ways to do things."
1	cant loot any of the good places with out hearing THREAT DETECTED and 500 rounds being sprayed at you THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED THREAT DETECTED
-1	THREAT DETECTED!
1	I absolutely love the game so far just would like to know when the next wipe date will be.
1	 and could be better in the future. Good amount of content considering it's a fairly new game. Overall just love it!!!"
1	 or let us tame the horses at least"
1	 glock come on hook us up. A prison Game mode would be dope too i saw the jail part od the map. THIS GAME IS HOT!!!"
-1	 crude craftingneeds much work"
1	Aldente
-1	 the crafting is more work to figure out then surviving.  Not enough loot.  I realize it is early access and these things  could change in the future but for now I dont recommend it.  Give it time."
-1	 because then we may end up looking at yet another unfinished Early Access game rotting in our libraries."
1	It's a fun game with a ton of potential hope the devs stick to itAs is the game is good to go especially for a early access Alpha stage Sure there is a chance of running into a hacker as with any game dont let that deter yaTo maximize chances of survival and overall fun I'd encourage to play with friends as there are a lot of people who play in groups and most have bloodlust for fresh spawns
1	 and the gun play is something you'd have to try for yourself to see how smooth it feels! Good luck and see you around the prison!                                                                                    9.5/10 ~G"
-1	 of course with its own little twist like a tedious nutrition system and ""realistic"" stats. I do not recomend this"
1	okay this game is a dayz port but it has surpassed dayz by 100% ive spend a while on this game already and i think this game is already better then some games that are about to shut down (H1Z1 just survive) and that was a solid game but this makes H1 look like pac-man versus the last of us and yes this game is still developing so things are constantly changing but the developers are not sleeping on this game they've put out patches like crazy making sure the game is running at tip top shape and that makes me proud to say i support these guys i would deffinitely suggest this game
-1	"I can not play the game. As soon as I launch the game I get the message ""Launch Error Acess is denied."" Does anyone know what went wrong?"
-1	 cargo containers and more. If it can see you through it can also shoot you through it as well from what I've seen. The robots detection mechanic needs a massive revamp on how it sees people and they need to be taken out of the game in the mean time. It's actually ridiculous atm so I'm not going to play until it's fixed. There isn't any point in playing when most of the combat takes place at military installations only to get shot through a object by a robot for the seventh time in a row."
-1	so far ...terrible like a cheap broken dayz but shiiter lol
1	i like that the map is big but getting from one place to another across the map is kind of dificult so i would apritiate u adding vehicles and new guns are also important
1	 which is a shame because i really really love the idea and design. If anyone knows how to improve the framerate and whatnot without turning the graphics down (i already did that) id love to hear it."
1	-underrated-
1	Has alot of potential.  Needs more content.  Very polished for a $19.99 game.  Looking forward to the future of the game.
1	Never been this excited about pooping in a sink before. 10/10
1	its a good game but it jsut came out so its bad but should wait a couple of updates
1	The answer to everything in this game is: more meat.
1	 flows well for me. I play essentially with one hand which is hard with a lot of games but not this one. scroll wheel for changing your walk/jog/run speed is great and love the crafting/inventory system (lighting a fire you ""select"" lighter/match/etc. as well as the campfire then select ""light"" as an example.Gameplay: Nearly nonexistant in single player but still can find things to do. Multiplayer I am looking forward to when I try it out."
1	 Great job."
-1	how can i get this game to quite lagging so bad
-1	trash
1	 so with that and the consistent updates I'm reasonably confident the game will only get better and be well worth the money."
1	-Spawning-Find a ak-47-Kill a random dude-Chop him-Chop him again-Make it cook-Eat him -Kill another dude-Chop him-Chop him again-Poop the other first dude on his head-Eat his head-Got killed-Got chop-Got cook-Got eat-Get my chest pooped on my own head 14/10 Would play again.
1	very  good  game been  enjoying  it  only  complaint  is  the  lag   and  some  minor frame  rate  issues  during  gameplay  hope  that can  be  fixed  in  the future  would  highly  recommend it  for  anyone   to  give it  a try .Happy  gaming  to  all.
1	 hopefully that gets re worked. 7. more animals please8.is fishing a thing????9. crops???10. the basic shelter/ lean to  should be able to be crafted with ropes... why it requires 6 rolls of thread seems pretty difficult... and seems weaker than improvised rope..   These are just a few thoughts untill i get more time under my belt.  The game is still fun but that could be just because its still new but its very frustrating to do just the simplest of tasks...  If you get in on the game now while its only $20 its very much worth it... but if it were priced like a triple A game right now i'd say forget it..."
1	You can $#!% in the woods with your friends 10/10.
-1	 played 2 hours WE got bored!!!!!I know its early acces BUT STILL make it so that you can get your loot back after you die.....Got 444 points and when got back in action its 0 nowNo place to buld a camp or hide or starage box??!!!(base building )Sad to see me opening my chrismass present and its a used barbie doll...............WIll still give the game a try It was my chrismass pesent .................... Good luck Game Developers"
1	Poopin' on it.
1	we need optimization
1	 I'll probably end up eatting them in this game too."
1	 but it's Early Access for a reason and I look forward to keeping pace with the developers as their vision is realized."
1	Gets informed I need to take a dump.Takes a dump.Literally craps a can of edible spaghetti and meatballs.10/10 game.UPDATE:Additional poop items include but are not limited to:- Pineapples- Scissors- Candy Bars- MP5 Magazines- Apples
1	 which makes it hard to engage PVP. -Servers going downRight now you have to reconnect once in a while. Keep in mind that this review is only after two sessions of playing and the game is only two days into early acces. The potential of this game is huge."
-1	 by survival games always ending up flopping."
1	"if there was a ok button i would tick it they have a 5-6 pound supporters pack which as far as i can see gives you nothingpvp is pointless at present as people teleport all over the place {not hackers) no where to call home this game needs a persistant box or base placement finding ya freinds on the server list is aweful and no join freinds game option in steam eitherwhen you ""respawn"" after death nothing changes other than you have nothing your stats stay the same soif you starving then your starvinf when you respawn with very little time to find food this happened to a freind 6 times he died he gave up in the end :(the game has great potential and tbh its one of the better alpha releases ive played it needs work alot of work including sorting the supporters pack that gives you nothing but says you will get stuff"
1	 more finished than dayz already. Devs seem to listen pretty well and patch issues almost immeditly."
1	 most of these players have not put that into prespective.it's worth a buy"
-1	 graphics are pretty good but the controls and no loot kill it for me super borning nothing but running around will be asking for a refund"
1	 my god. This game looks like a masterpiece."
1	 support the developer.It's totally worth it."
1	Dayz killer
1	 when i go out and want to go back i got lost where the place i build before."
1	 I believe in this game and the roadmap seems like a dream to someone like me who enjoys 7 days to die."
1	 the other big survival games (like DayZ etc.) won't stand a chance against this game."
1	 plus a mild ammount of d- sync."
1	SCUM is a game DayZ couldn't become. The developers are at work very fast and improvments are being made everyday. With their edition of anti cheat if they clean up some things this game will be around for a while.
1	no words for that beauty...the potential is amazing imo.
1	 the worst thing I have found is just some inconveniences with the crafting and inventory menus or dropping items (guns) from your hands when you go to eat or craft or climb a ladder etc."
1	 and gear is insane.I can't wait to see what the final product of SCUM will evolve into.Get it while it's $20."
1	 Bases. Amazing stuffGive this game some time and its going to be amazing."
1	 I'll be playing this for years to come. Highly recommended if you like survival with some occassional pvp."
1	 as I in turn dismember other prisoners just to see what makes their legs move. Yeah. Such a snow flake."
1	 such as lack of distant cover rendering and the advantage of third person view being able to see around corners or over walls.This game is a lot of fun and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style of game."
1	 and I'm going to keep coming back for more."
1	 but it's not full to the brim with other players. Looking forward to getting home this evening and digging into this game some more."
-1	They spend more money on marketing than making the game.SCUM is absolutely empty of any content or gameplay.Walking Sim 2018 for sure.
1	 and for that I would say if you have the extra cash and want to support the devs definitely do so."
1	 it might be the game we've all been waiting for here in about 6 months!"
1	First its an early access game.second that cost close to 17 euros.and third the devs doing work and listening to the community now compare it with dayz and leave a positive review!Thank you
1	 they're owning."
-1	 I don't see it getting updated much."
1	it seems fun but I have more than the recommended pc specs and get 35-40 frames on low with bad rubber banding in town areas.
-1	Takes hours to find guns and ammo. Have to run for miles for tiny towns. BOREDOM GAME SUCKS
1	 i hit 100 in 5 mins."
1	 others STILL feel broken after 4 years in development.110% recommend this game."
1	 you'll love this one."
1	best $20 i've spent on steam there's so much attention to detail
-1	Like the dayz mod from 6 years ago with way less features. Followed this games development for over a year but this is a terrible first impression.
-1	not fun~
-1	 especially for how high of a price it asks from you."
1	Sto posto vrhunska igrica... Svaka cast timu koji ju je odradio... I nadamo se zanimljivim nadogradnjama u buducnosti.. Jedini minus je taj sto je mozda za razliku od ostalih igrica prejeftina...
1	So far so good.
-1	 respect for you!"
1	 the game is fantastic. It will only get better. For the price it is absolutely  worth it if u like survival shooters like dayz etc."
1	DayZ and PUBG !"
-1	Mechs shooting you through walls. players desyncing everywhere - F*cking DONE with this game!
1	gay
1	 this will be the zombie survival game."
1	Really have been enjoying this game a whole lot and its even better when you play it with a group of friends.Pros :-Loot is pretty easy to find-metabolism management where you have to keep track of your characters vitals-different character stats so you can make different builds of characters-mechs and zombies add a challenge-have a map by default-can spawn on your friends or in different places by earning fame points ( easy to meet up with friends )-party system so you can tell where your friends are-many different types of weapons and ammunition- is realistic but not so realistic as to not make it a fun gamecons- memory leak after around 30 minutes of gameplay where you have to relog to get your fps back up- need a minimum of 16gb of ram to play because of the memory leak ( i have 16gb luckily )-has some desync issues where zombies or players will skip around sometimes-i don't like the feature if your holding something in your hands and you pick something else up your character will just toss the other item you were holding on the ground. This causes sometimes losing of weapons if you didn't notice you dropped it .
1	 but awesome survival especially the pve"
1	Great game for the future! If you try the alpha you get hooked inmediately.
1	 play something else and come back to SCUM once it has some major updates under its belt."
1	 the game is already in one of the best Early Access states compared with other games."
1	8/10 badass game
-1	Run until you get shot by a robot simulator 19
1	  chopped me up and made a smiley face out of my meaty bits.I could hear him snacking on the rest of me. It will take him a long time with the sausage.10/10 would feed the homeless again."
1	 This game rips the pair of them apart allready!!! & its only early access!!! Muhahahahahahaha!!! Join today!!!!"
-1	I refunded this game... Walking simulator
1	 a lot of online no wait.got into it 15 min gameplay. its fun and new give it a try you like this one ;Dgo get it needs more players and there is already a bunch of scum"
1	Single player feel is not bad you can spend countless hours honing your survival. More fun with friends for sure.
1	 ofc there are a few lags sometimes in busy areas but I definitly recommand this awesome game! Awesome dev team too !"
1	nice
1	its what DayZ should have been. The developers are keeping the game updated and keeping in touch with the community. Cant wait till base building is added. Keep up the great work!!!! 10/10 buy great for the price.
1	 running towards him to unleash my karate chop to finish him off-Seen his other skinny rat looking friend appear running down the hill -He has a shovel.-I turn around and run away-Found underground bunker-Get killed my Mech-Respawned-Took a poop and found a Banana10/10"
-1	 played but after a short time searching some houses to find 2 pair of scissors and a pair of shoes lost interest. I didn't play long but it just felt the same old thing."
1	 even in it's current state."
1	 the game hasn't even been out for 3 days of the time im writing this. Of course there are glitches and bugs and missing content but its a early access tittle. the developers are realy working hard on the game because they roll out daily updates to fix the games problems. It is realy good and if you have a decent computer go for it."
-1	 I'll come back to the game a couple of months later."
1	 cannibal-raider friend."
-1	 no objective other than to survive..... boredom.Might wait till something new comes along."
-1	 waste of time dont bother"
1	 while trying to maintain your shaky alliance with the other orange clad goon skulking about the aircraft hangars. As it stands scum is an interesting twist on an already established genre and with future updates looks to become a very promising and entertaining title."
1	 the visuals are amazing and oh how did i forget about the Huge Robots protecting military sites which has important loot. at the end this game is fun and addictive i know i only played 5.6 hours how do i say its addictive well the only thing holding me back is the resolution problem. overall rating : 7.5/10 Cons: hard to find players / not enough puppets(zombies)/ loot is low/ needs optimizations/ servers should have a 100 players max instead of 64 players"
1	 planks and scraps of metal you find."
1	 and begin having fun. No need to suffer for hours to try and find fun in the game. Cant wait to see future updates!"
-1	 everything is in the way of you enjoying the cool parts"
1	 sound better. - I get 60-80 fps when the server restarts but as time goes on my frames drop to 25-30. I also am playing on a potato pc so I can't complain about that"
1	 it goes to a random monitor. Not cool. I wish I could play it more :("
1	 watched a few videos and got a grip within two hours of play"
1	 jd gamenya lumayan berat. tapi namanya juga mash EA jd gak masalah sih.Comments are disabled for this review."
1	 just had quite a bit of hype so it drew in lots of people that maybe dont understand the type of game its is. It looks amazing too."
1	 i really enjoy this game for a multitude of reasons like the gunplay and survival mechanics. The craafting can be slightly confusing at first but when you get used to it it's really easy. Great game and updates coming alll the time. :)"
1	:D
1	Good Stuff. So much new stuff being added as time goes on.Still a work in progress but shows great potential.Buy this game
1	 just run to a military base and get geared upKOS KOS KOS (every player doesn't know what the talk button is and just shots on site)Airfield is the only PVP place due to 64 player serversBarely any content at the moment (will come)Third Person combat is useless as the peaking mechanic is broken AFOverrall the game ATM is fun for a few hours then get's extremely boring."
-1	games trash rn
1	 BUT PLEASE REGION LOCK CHINA! AS AN INDIAN PLAYER IT TRIGGERS ME HOW MANY CHINESE HACKERS THERE ARE!"
1	It's kind of a funny game but it's too laggy for my liking and the map is too big
1	 this game has realy got tons of potential."
1	 finally."
1	 and wore its head+paws as trophies. 10/10."
-1	worse performance than dayz
1	 but hearing that more updates will be added such as fortification and vehicles this game will surely take the lead in open world survival."
1	Its what dayz should have been.
1	 I feel this game will loose momentum if they can't add the storyline or the events sooner then later"
1	Pee'd in a bath..... 5 stars
1	 i do recommend the game to everyone. But do expect lag/bugs since it just got released. This might be the tip top ""Survival game"" of the year."
1	love it very good for an alpha game
1	Really nice work from the developers. One of the best delivered early access games I've played.
-1	 which (it seems to me) was not possible to turn off."
1	just a good game
-1	 only if you have very modern PC."
-1	 keep in mind that yes I understand what EA is and the exscuse babies like to throw onto unfinished games. But in all honesty there is no content. Survival is a chore and a bore. And at the end of the day this is a DayZ mod which DayZ started out as a mod. In reality it isn't connected to DayZ except by gameplay which it actually is a downgrade from. Now back onto the devolopers and EA games since that's all the gameplay that is in the game. One thing people have to realise with EA games is that the devolopers aren't hurting for money. This is a way for them to make bonus profits while the game is being devoloped. A major misconeption about EA games is that the dev team is struggling to put food on the table so it's ok to rip off gamers. But in reality they're doing just fine and this is extra money to throw onto another project early the same as Space Engineers or Reign of Kings. Are their good EA games? Sure! But if the new market today is how finished is your game on release which most of the time it isn't. Why support a game that's been in devolopment for years and is so far behind DayZ that.... why don't you play DayZ? If you find the lack of features inviting and the lack of any actualy pvp outside of a zombie running at you that all you have to do is strafe and hit with a rake. Then this is the game for you."
-1	 that's kind of that. will come back and revise my review when there's more to it"
1	Devs have been working hard addressing the issues players have been experiencing the last few days.
1	what a game
1	 etc."
1	Awesome game that still has a long way to go.
1	 just single player needs a bit more work"
1	It actually better than I predicted. Crazy because even with the issues it has its more addicting than any other game I have played since ARK. Cant wait to see whats next. Just keep the community updates frequent and I will be happy throughout development. Defiantly worth 20$
1	 but I love it."
1	Open world survival and pvp with intersting mechanics. Very good for an early release and developers are active and engaged with player.
1	 because we don't want negative reviews bringing this great game down."
-1	IT IS JUST A TOXIC DAY Z CLONE AND I Have a 1060 6 gb i can only reach 30 fps on normal graphics would not suggest at all
1	 BUT we need transportation like cars and bikes or at least riding horses instead of killing them ! the map is huge needed approx. an hour to get where i wanted to be."
1	Great game
-1	ranning simulatrpr
1	 but server hosting need some fixes."
1	 and will only get more polished in time. I love it."
-1	 maybe in the future."
1	This game has brought me back to PC gaming.
1	Buyer beware.  Do your research....  but I've had some really fun moments in this game...  time will tell but this is the best chance for a updated Dayz experience.  It's already WAYYYY  better than SA.I hope they pull it off.
1	Fun game and especially for a early acces has a lot of potential
1	 verging on the edge of insanity.I recommend buying the Deluxe edition. It let me poop a banana."
1	TFW you care about the scumbag's diet more than yours IRL.
1	 everything is beautifully written by ZEKO https://steamcommunity.com/id/zeko194/recommended/513710/"
1	I've been playing this game for a total of 6 kilos (13.2277357 pounds) and I am really enjoying it. It is definitely worth 7711.8 DOGEcoin's. Would recommend!-Best laggy game I've played
1	better than dayz
1	45 fps achieved with Unreal Engine - Seems legit
-1	 but you are not allowed to drive them.The most tedious and humdrum ""game"" I've ever seen.I will definitely refund this cause I bought the supporter pack and I really don't want to support this product."
-1	000 dollar rig."
-1	 this is a perfect game.10/10- ign"
1	 i was off on my adventure."
1	Best looking survival game yet. It has promise.
-1	 as well as the amount of running required."
-1	Thank god I refunded this
1	 very detailed"
1	amazing game for being in aplha keep it up guys
-1	 so save your money and stay away. This game is worst than DayZ and PUBG combined."
-1	This game is horrible imiation of ARMA's dayz with even more buggy core behind the game and with even less content. Don't buy!!
1	finally a decent early access survival game that's not ShitZ
1	good fast update
-1	In it's current state this game is not enjoyable... although it has good potential.Pros: Good GraphicsGood Character StatusGreat Character CustomizationCool AreasCons:Terrible StutteringDayZ type player desyncRobots that are too difficult to hide from due to them seeing you even though you are hiddin behind and objectRobots that shoot through solid rocks and containersBaaaad shooting mechanics
-1	It takes more the maximum 2 hours for refund to realize that the game is bad. Steam wont refund you so.
1	 also more guns and attachments would be great as well. Even with only 15.8 hours played and 1000's of hours on other survival games I can confidently say SCUM is the best of the best! And will be so much better when more and more features are released!"
-1	 leave this game immediately."
1	Awesome game with HUGE potential.
1	 what else do you want?"
-1	 but sadly thats not as often as you hope. Constent server wipes are annoying as well."
-1	 please don't waste 20$ on this game it is not worth it at all. Sure it seems like it's a good game but it honestly isn't. Thanks for your time!"
1	Had some fun looting military bases and stuff with friends... huge map! excited for upcoming features!
1	Fun game. Just an insane amount of bugs and glitches. And crazy never ending server issues
-1	No content.
1	 it's not a bad idea to wait maybe a month or so but this should be leagues ahead of Dayz pretty damn quickly."
1	The game is very enjoyable and full of very detailed character statistics.
1	 player models are pretty dope for an indie game.""> Admiring my character's gains (no homo)> get shot because I'm standing still and have no pants on.10/10"
-1	 but the game won't even start on my PC. It seems to be Easy Anti-Cheat is the reason."
-1	plz fix your FOV.
1	 Id like to give a big shout out to the devs who work on this game and its updates CONSTANTLY. It's refreshing to log on to see patches almost twice weekly and not some ""big quarterly patch"". I look forward to see where things go and I'm optimistic that this game will go in the right direction."
1	much real such good
1	nice game
1	Pog.
-1	 dont buy this game coz you cant play it yet"
1	It's like DayZ but good.
1	 has bugs/optimisation issues and then proceeding to give it a negative review.Support the devs."
1	Best zombie open world survival game ever made to this date. Dont @ me
-1	 but hope to have Asian servers."
1	 which brings a whole new dynamic to survival games.Will you use cunning and stealth to hide from Mech Sentries to get to high loot places?Or will you wait with nice gear and a SVD outside to kill the ones who just done that work for ya?EXCELLENT GAME!9/10edit: Typo"
1	 and join the SCUM brotherhood!"
1	 and realistick ! love it  if dev would add Battle Royale (Boring) they will turned blue hole into a dark hole for sure !"
1	i love constantly suiciding and waiting longer and longer to respawn
-1	 then be penilised if you die again lmaoEDIT: No anti cheat....really? (Updated: Now at least has EAC protection"
-1	 but making someone pay for this utter garbage is ridiculous.  You can't even fist fight/melee fight someone yet.  When you get near another player you just go into insane lag mode where you jump around the other one and you're not able to hit them.  I got a refund after 37 minutes of gameplay and I suggest anyone else to do the same before putting to many hours in.  This company doesn't deserve your money if their going to be this greedy.  Game should be free alpha until its at least the tiniest bit playable."
1	 I think the FOV is zoomed in too much. I think this might  be to help with the FPS at the moment and im hopeful they will add an FOV slider in the future as they optimise the game.  Anyway  i just wanted to give this game the credit it deserves     10 / 10"
1	 also pvp is almost impossible with the amount of glitching the players do. Still recommend and has a lot of potential."
1	 but I expected as much since this is the second day of alpha and servers are flooded because of hype. Honestly at $20 you can't beat it."
1	 just get a refund."
1	 but currently lacks substance."
1	mabuk free.... 10/10 will play again
1	this game is going to be huge...massive...what a game this is...love it...graphics etc are fantastic...its immersing...very addictive...cant fault it...devs fantastic job on this game....still under develpment...wow...10/10..so far...p.s..and for the price wow cant go wrong...
-1	 rinse and repeat!!!"
1	 better than dayz the lotIve only played a short time on it and im in loveI get that its only in early access but i do have some things that id love to be in the game such as:Possible base building / Clan buildingsVehiclesMore atatchments and gunsI do get that some of these may be in progress it is just what id love to see in the gameI highly do recommend this game to everyone and am encouraging all my friends to buy it"
1	Very promising survival game. Way more polished than DayZ when it was released and developers actually seem to put effort in. If devs keep up the good work this game could be special.
1	 you won't regret buying this gem!"
-1	 other player move like they have lag.This early acess scams need to stop."
-1	this game at this stage doesnt have enough content for me to keep running back to it. it might be to ahead of its time. in my experience i was just running around for an hour not being able to find anything. i would not buy this game this early on.
-1	 then you probably wont find much use for this game. Refunding and waiting to see where this game goes."
1	Solid Early Access. If they stick with the updates every week this game has alot of potential. Even in its current state I would reccomend.
-1	 if you play in a 64 ppl server and than go to another one you have to do everything again."
1	Everything I wanted DayZ and H1Z1 to be.
1	+
1	This game has serious potential. Really enjoy playing it. Just quite a few bugs still which is expected with early access.Really recommend this to anyone. Far better than PUBG as well as GTA Online
1	"Hey guys Game is great i love you "")"
1	 and do their best to patch issues quickly. Updates are almost daily."
1	 have 22 hours of fun out of it so far highly recomend. its had a good lauch i just hope the devs keep working on it to bring new content to make the game even more exiting. but before added such features the game as a whole needs optimisation but THIS GAME IS AMAZING."
1	I'm hooked .Never seen an alpha version this good. Huge claps for those DEVS for an intense survival RPG game. It's actually the best I've played so far and the game is like 10% finished lol.Insane graphics ( needs strong cfg if you want to run in epic : I have i5 6700k +16Go DDR4 + 1060gtx + EVO drive m.2 )You get the usuals problems like desync but it will be fixed I'm sure ! ( I HOPE )Also craft is clunky but it will improve !
1	the game is good but it needs aloy of work due to the fact that your in a sever and within a cou0ple of mins you are kicked out and have to start over again with a new player adn have to find all the loot again
1	I hope that the complete translation of the game into French will be made in the coming weeks
1	 you had ur chance and lost it :')"
1	 10/10 would buy twice."
1	 and the fact that your rep goes back to zero is a bit much. I know its early access but howay lads"
1	 or using 2 clips on full auto from an ak witch is like wasting 3 hours in 2 secconds takes a huge dumpsome  additions if your going to have tec-1 buildings and mechs there needs to be some not a lot but some npc guards as well instead of the zombies at military bases as with the storyline of being a prisoner sent there to be part of a show i dont see a company advanced enough to make mechs leaving them behind on guard but no troops and leaving the buildings full of gearnpc bandits if implemented ide say rare random spawns with decent gear lastly even if not the two npc ideas another would be adding in roaming hordes of zombies of varying numbers tho that will only really work if you do something like i mentioned earlier with editing speedagain love the game keep up the good work and i cant wait to see how the game develops it could very well become the ""guide"" for future survival games"
1	 The map is 12km x 12km which is absolutely huge to have to march across but the map is beautiful which makes it a lot less of a pain for the time being. Ive been in servers before where ive killed people and then the server has a hiccup that reverts us back to before the combat started so now theyre expecting me which is a sad thing to happen but im sure whatever the reason for it may be theyre working on it.I have alot of high hope for this game so far even though its very early on. i cant wait to see what the Devs do with this"
-1	Yep I have to say that this game even tho i have lil bit better than minimum pc req. it still crashes sometimes and its not too stable. I know its a few days out but i cant reccomend this game. So If they optimize it little bit more it could be playable god praise the refunds.
1	 and I can't recommend enough that you ruin your life as well."
-1	If you what a good game.......  Nah! dont buy this game SERIOUSLY
1	Hard working devsFun to streamsnipe10/10
1	 especially considering it's only in early access currently"
1	Nice game with good potential and awesome graphics!
-1	 lets see where this goes."
1	I like
1	The Dayz killer?
1	Seven Steps to do any task... 10/10
1	So far im enjoying it. All though I don't have many hours it's sure to change. What i'm hoping for soon is more populated AUS server for me and my friends and a solution to their being no loot what so ever besides at military outposts. I do have very little game time so I could've just been unlucky. But so far the game has been superb. The details and the feel of it is amazing to me.
1	 loving it so far."
1	This game makes me happy
1	 fix the UI stretching for ultra wide."
-1	 Memory leaks (went from 100+ fps to 40-50 in 20mins) I was really looking forward to this game but it's a huge dissapointment its just dayz with a few extra features tbh dayz is better. REFUNDED"
1	Please fix servers thanks
-1	 Map seems to be almost entirely wilderness."
1	 will 100% come back later and pay a higher price once they are ironed out."
1	Im in love with the description for the tracking suit.Servers are not perfect but they are improving each hour
1	good game hotfixed in the first hour. yay
-1	It didn't even let me join a server.
1	 it hits home with the old Arma 2 DayZ mod days."
-1	 etc.)."
1	 graphics and sounds are realy good.  I love the survival elements!"
1	 but it's just a bit too early access for me.I am giving the thumbs up for this game purely because I see the potential it has."
-1	If you like boring games like DayZ you'll most likely enjoy SCUM. Alls you do is search for loot for hours and find nothing only to be killed.
-1	 there's no loot and tons of glitch 10/10 would refund again"
-1	 consider this as a single player game... and not a good one."
-1	very poor fps i have a decent gaming pc and cart even run on  high. lags throughout and cart even go in the city with smooth fps needs optimization from devs.
1	 movement/animation and gameplay as a whole is amazing and keeps getting better. Absolutely worth 10 bucks"
-1	 if done right will be what DayZ dreamed of being. Right now though id say its in a prealpha state and needs ALOT of work. Hope the devs stick to their guns but as of right now i cant recomend this game."
1	 just fix the stuttering pleaseedit: i still love the game and still play it lol thanks for the response :D"
1	 pro's- fantastic survival (not for the faint)- weapon's are fantastic mechanics similar to arma 3- Zombie's- Mech's- Bear'scon's-not to many craftables and some are broken(obviouslly its early release)-client memory leak's(simple restart to fix it)-hyperthermia-no introduction/tutorial"
1	fun gaem
1	 very nice)"
1	 go back to dayz fanboy."
1	Dont buy this game cause its still early access and the feature is so early. but if u want some game like DAYZ u should buy it and i hope this game have more feature next update like we not playing this game for looting and killing is bored
1	 or even just with normal people. So yeah... There's a lot of room for growth and the dev has big plans so it's definitely worth pitching in 20 bucks to see how far we can take this game. Ooone bad thing however is... My character sounds like they're tap dancing on the floor when I'm just trying to crouch sneak. wtf please fix"
-1	DONT BUY !!! cheaters are every where this game is full of cheater !!!!!!!!!!
1	Very Good just has some bad issues right now would recommend to wait to buy
1	 just wish i had some friends to play with ^_^"
-1	Would be good minus the hackers.
1	Best survival game ever!!!
-1	 that would be a great way to distrack a bot off of yourself."
1	 knowing no privacyis beating the hell outta him10/10 would recommend"
-1	 STUPID ME. MOST OF MY HOURS PLAYED WERE JUST RUNNING TO FIND NO LOOT AND CONSTANTLY GETTING KILLED BY HACKERS. DEAD WORLD DONT BUY!"
1	Quite literally the best way to make 20 of your hard earned dollars disapear for little to no value. Highly recomend.
1	 only to get shot in the face while I was typing ""Hi"". People are just killing each others for fame since there is no goal in this game.Recommended only to ppl who likes PUBG."
1	The best open world/survival our there right now. Even thou its still in pre-release.
1	 not to begin with the mechs that patroll military bases. These mechs can see see you in a silo without windows and the doors closed just to shoot jou down through a wall or door when you think you are save. With the amount of work thats done to gather resources and weapons so you are comfortable with breaking in a millitary base and fight other players it is just cruel to be robbed of all your efforts like that. I would stil recomend the game because its just a lot of fun to play and considering what is already in the game i cant wait to find out what the developers have to offer in the future. However if you cant stand being killed and losing all your loot because of some annoying bugs or sometimes microstutter i would definetly wait for the game to be developed further."

1	 i think this will be the best survival game out there :) ."
1	"The best ""zombie""/survival game out there. The physics are great too"
1	 escpecially for such a low price. Anybody complaining about lagg and bugs: uninstall and suck a turd."
-1	 so no need to hide that."
1	 sort of..."
-1	Running around for hours to loot and kill or be killed by people gets boring. The game lacks content and is has a loads hackers.
1	 and I gotta say its really fun to try and survive in the wilderness. I can totally recommend this game to anyone who has a survival craving! I give this game a 7/10"
-1	 in a fifteen round mag.-Shake head.  It's only been two weeks..."
-1	The game is interesting but...10 chiters out of 10
-1	 let them earn your coin"
1	 TARGET ENGAGED  Head gets blasted off Died Instantly10/10 lost my gear"
-1	100% honest review: ive put a good amount of hours into this game as i was off work when it was released and i have to say if your solo dont bother you will spend hours getting stuff just to lose it when you die and spawn far away evan if you have the points to spawn in the sector you wont be colse if you have a life dont bother takes hours to do anything in this game its not suitable if you dont have the time to spend hours on end in each game play session its just not made for the average gamer the game looks good and i like the idea and yes its not a full game but everything is just to far and few inbetween evan when they add more areas in your still traveling hours to get around and yes there gunna bring out vehicles but guess what youll have to grind hours just to get fuel and get them running there not just going to give you working vehicles honestly and lastly your working towards nothing you will eventually be able to build forts and what not and you can group up but then what if youve been everywhere looting and youve raided peoples bases then it becomes stale why would you want to spend hours looting the same places over and over honestly its a good game for what it is but a waste of money evan if it barley costs anything
-1	 but the game did not exit properly and a backround process was still running so by the time steam support saw my refund ticket I had 4 hours game time and could not get a refund. Game not exiting properly should not be my fault."
-1	 way better way of spending money."
1	 it's a 10."
1	Its a very potential game so much to do. Wish I didn't die so often though. But the walking and looking for teammates is so tiresome. This games needs a update fast or you will start to loose players!
1	 this game is already a contender for one of the greats and will definitely outshine its competition when all your work has been implemented. Looking forward to the final full release."
-1	Run simulator.
1	Awesome !!!
-1	just a fad
-1	I haven't even played an hour of the game. The performance that i am getting on my gtx 1060 max q is ridiculous. I cannot even maintain a solid 50 fps without dipping into the 10s and 20s. I will consider playing this game in the near future when the devs optimize the game.
1	 i just hope they sort this problem out very soon i will still be playing."
-1	 i have a med - high range gaming pc and i get unplayable frame lag on the lowest settings."
-1	This shiiiiiiit is wack. Taking a shiiiit in real life is more enjoyable.
-1	 don't scum it."
1	 have over 100 hours already and still learning new things about the game every day"
-1	 and just not a fan of the game"
-1	 it's not happening."
-1	This game lacks if any direction from the devs.This game is a straight out copy of arma3 exile only diffrence is exile plays better than this  mod.This game has potential but serously lacking any worthy content.The dysnc is a major issue and is completly unplayable.Hopefully with all their new found wealth they can hire some xtra people to fix their net code mess cause i doubt they have the expertise to do it themselves.
-1	BRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFT *plop* SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
1	Survival Game with a lot of potencial!
-1	This game does not run. No menu. wait on buying
-1	 unnecessary and irrelevent people.)Yes I do have a perfect reason to moan as I've watched plenty of videos and even bought the deluxe edition to write this review."
1	Epic game :))
-1	 how on earth has the hype train gone so mad for this?"
1	dayz was a gam. scumk is a gam. snumk is beeter. it pased the frog test. thum up
1	This seems awesome so far! Don't expect too much since it's still very early access.But so far I really enjoy the game and I'm looking forward to experiencing more content.The developers listen to the community and I belive this game has a very bright future.
1	 but it's already a cool game."
1	 don't. Just forget it and buy this before it get's more expensive.It's worth it."
-1	 game seems pretty good besides the sponge from people absorbing 30+ hatchet hits. I'll edit this review in a month if things change."
1	Not even an hour in but already having a blast! Some server issues here and there but that's to be expected of a game that's just released in early access. This game is promising to be great!
1	n1
1	VERY GUT
-1	 tried to change resolution and now the game is stuck and cant even be played. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and its still stuck. No support is responding and its a waste of 20$ Dont even bother youre better off saving your money rather than being scammed like i was"
1	 the game will be great within a year"
-1	 but then I played SCUM."
1	 8gb ram on epic seetings. when i find time i will upgrade this."
1	Already a few hotfixes on release that have fixed many issues. I think these guys will give us a good survival game.Cool crafting system too.
-1	Not very fun it is just a over hyped Dayz
1	I really like the game so far. Will report back once I've played more.
-1	 but after getting to play it I have lost interest in merely 3 hours. I'm out. Refund requested."
1	In all honesty i feel like im playing Dayz on the Escape from tarkov engine with mechs its a ok game but need better server support and maybe a loot buff
1	 early access and the game is already amazing."
1	 but EA meant to get info from the players and improve upon it before selling the game as finished which is pretty nice"
-1	"Lets put it this way...I paid for this game! Played two hours and wished I had those two hours back. Requested a refund from steam which I received. If I had to do it all over again... hell ""NO"" would I buy this. Check back maybe in a few months...right now I cant recommend this one. Just read all these other neg. Most of which have been covered as to why a neg.Spent two hours and the ""loot"" system is aweful. Servers are crap at the moment. Didnt see any other person on a full laggy server in those two hours. I could go on...I'll check back in a month or two..."
-1	 you know what you're doing.so yeah i guess just wait the usual 5 years for the dev cycle to pull through then it'll probably be good."
1	Just WOW!
1	This game feels good..
-1	Sadly the game does nothing to help or keep players engaged. Even meeting up with friends was easier on any other survivel MMO.
1	Just works. Might be best survival game out right now.
1	 vehicles need to be added ASAP for a better experience-No way to spawn with friends."
1	 movement and interaction with the player.- Robots make the game just as nerveracking.- Great survival game to play with your friends and build a shelter to camp out the night.- Hardcore survivalists will enjoy this game having to monitor all of there stats.- Decent graphics.- Price is very good for what the game has to offer so far."
-1	 etc.   im sure it will be much better in a year or so"
1	:D
-1	 I have to assume that this game is just another cash grab made by some developers who put their goals way to high.Don't rush things for the sake of quick money."
-1	No items found simulator 2018...
-1	Was not expecting this I have a 1060 6gb and r5 1600 and getting about 40 to 48 fps and everything is on medium and high. everything is great except the fps I'll get the game again when they optimize it
1	 so go play it and have fun."
1	 but with community support and feedback (not just straight up complaining and whining about an early access game and problems that are to be expected with an early access game) this could seriously be a great game if it can realize its full potential."
1	Verry nice
1	Definitely worth the $20 in its current state along as it was optimizedA better dayz in the making  I gamed for hours opening day servers crashed for the first couple hours but it stabilized for the last 4 hours I love the sprint control and the anti 3rd person cheating the whole metabolism system is a little complicated but after hours  of hour of playing its simplified to this kill a deer cook and eat the meat loads of calories and find fruits and veggies like corn watermelon spawn points for your daily vitamins and you will be good on that end Also love how you can tear muscles from running to long and to hard This game has massive potential let's hope it follows though on what it has been promised to be come
1	 buy it"
1	Nice Graphics nice frame rate for early access play style is fun couple of bugs also game has potential which is good. Love a good hardcore survival game
1	.
1	 this game is for you hands down. No other game like this comes close. I cant wait too see what more they add to this game!!"
1	 not ran into many bugs and is SO fun to play with mates :D"
1	Nice but really hard.
1	+
-1	 Just better optimalization thanks :]"
-1	THE GAME IS BROKE UNPLAYABLE
1	 unlike DayZ.. devs are actually active and reply to alot of comments and are trying to fix minor bugs ect within the game. The crafting in this game is great. the fact you can make bullets instead of finding them is a lot shorter of a process as sometimes it feels impossible to find the bullets your gun requires!.. over in its current state 7/10 of course theres room for improvment.. but what game isint? for it only getting launched yesterday and to be better than 90% of survival games is a good thing for me.. keep up the good work"
1	mmm  yummy
1	 and I am excited to see what this game becomes."
-1	 but almost no players and it takes hours to find anything.... Not fun."
1	 The DayZ Standalone i wanted."
1	 good job devs and keep up great work."
1	 they are pushing patches like crazy and listening to the community! I have almost 40 hours and I would say I got more than my 20 bucks worth. I am enjoying it so far with my friends."
1	Good game
1	Good
1	very fun game.it has it's share of bugs and incompleteness but it only costs 16 euro/and you can see you poop fall
-1	 even the ground. Unfortunate really."
-1	The controls are weird and the UI is confusing as hell if that gets fixed then it might be a cool game! sorry :|
-1	this game has night forever and combat sistem is to bad you can not eaven kill anyone with melee weapon
1	 this game like many with players and friends becomes much more funMy community is:https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/4/1737715419902443599/"
1	A very complex and beautiful survival game.
-1	nope
1	 you are OP against zombies."
-1	 for a very early in release schedule EA that is worrying.I'll change my review should the devs change this but it is hard to recommend with the current server hosting state. I bought the supporter edition and don't wish to refund as hoping this will change and the devs consider this but sadly wont recommend until then. If you can live with the potential network issues it may be worth taking a gamble hopign they address this as roadmap looks promising."
1	 boot the idiots and enjoy."
1	 and it is one of the best early access games i've purchased and can't wait to see what the dev's add next. Highly reccomended"
1	 but almost 20fps i am getting just optimize asap and try to fix desync issues."
1	 like somthing up to a red dot to a gun butstock and flashhiders ect ect anyways this game is pure perfection for a early access except for the internet problems."
1	This is what dayZ must of been! AWESOME game
1	amazing
1	 except I forgot to pee off the dam.   So I got to go back and do that."
1	 shooting through walls and doors.Overall i think this game has decent potential if the devs keep working at it."
1	 been surviving. if you hated dayz cause you had hopes for it.... this isn't that sad bus to no where... these devs are driving full speed and not looking back."
-1	booooooring fed up of people saying o its early access the games poooooo
1	A very detailed yet very simple survival game... Sometimes spawn sucks so you need to walk  s h i t  or kill yourself but there is loot wherever you spawn... All in all great game from my home country Croatia! :D
-1	 memory leak is an issue but not that bad compared to the mechanics of the game. overall terrible experience and not worth buying the current game until things are fixed"
1	 I think it's definitely worth a look."
1	its dayz but with poop
1	 but I think this game has incredible potential.Definetely recommend it."
1	you scum
-1	I played ARK and Rust for years every single day. This is the MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! Returned.
1	A playable DayZ! Finally!
1	 cant wait for more content and updates! keep up the good work!!"
-1	 then it will be as dead as Starcraft. LOL."
-1	 once you get guns with full mags and extra ammo there is really no reason to play since pvp is so rare. Well optimized and decent game but just doesn't hold attention."
1	It's more than perfect for an Early Access game.
1	 but overall seems minor.  The robots incorporate some great tense moments and really add to the experience.  f"
1	hacker now - he can make ak and he can kill faster - but he can't jump like Before --- This video is after updatehttps://clips.twitch.tv/VictoriousAttractiveTildeDoritosChip
-1	 only to come across a zombie and really not being able to defend yourself very well thus you end up being killed and having to restart the whole thing over again from scratch in a differant part of the map."
1	 I miss. He's gone."
1	Excellent game for early access. I've bought 10+ EA games (Early Access) and this one has been in the best shape on launch day and proceeding days. The game is definitely playable and fun. No it doesn't have much for end game at the moment. Yes a few things need tweaking. Yes both of those things are expected for early access.
1	 ran to the woodline to take a poop in private.... pooped out an AK mag :)"
1	 and you can clearly see there will be a lot more added. Great PVP. Has a ""DAYZ if it was done right"" feel to it. Glad I bought the supporter edition. These guys are doing a great job on this game."
1	Easy Anti-cheat is in place boys. The developpers are gonna prove to us with time that they care about our opinion. The game has just been released and so far I've had a lot of fun.
-1	 easy and very boring. All it has for it is unique metabolism system and that is all this game has. The gun fights in this game are horrible. hiding players in 3rd person while your player ""cant see"" was a bad idea. Leads to many unfun glitches and just overall confusion. Played 20hours and I have nothing good to say about this game. It's just a waste of time as of right now."
-1	 it's horrible. You cannot kill people with skill."
1	I think this game is a great game for its early access phase and for 20 bucks. The graphics look really outstanding and their is alot to do. I like as you do things you build up fan and if you do die you have options to spawn in a ranndom location to even a squad mate. I love the concept of an accualy realistic suvival game. The devs also are coming out with updates very often which is very encouraging and are intouch with there community. Im still gicing this a thumbs up and a definite 5 star but my only thing right now with the understand its early access and they are working on it. I feel like becasue the map is so vast that there is ALOT of running. Becasue of the stamana it can take a long time to get from grid to grid. But with that said there are alot of elements in the game to still make it alot of fun!
1	 is DayZ but made well. GG."
1	 10/10 would buy again :))"
1	If you ever played original dayz.. Wow.. Scum understands. A genre that is so important to so many. Thank you for stepping in the right direction scum. Im finally back to spending hours just in the unknown..
1	0 PLEASE!"
1	 looking forward for the new updates. really recommended!"
-1	Can't recommend until it is optimized.
1	ive been playing this game a few hours and im hooked ive always wanted to play day z but heard lots of bad things well this game so far is been everything some one would want of this type of game yea there is still some bugs but nothing game breaking that i have found10/10 so far
-1	 too many bugs. Needs many more updates to become a playable game."
1	 then this game is pretty darn good. I'm enjoying it and I've already gotten more than my money's worth from it."
1	A really good and details game eventhough it is an early access!
-1	 I got disconnected from the server. I logged right back into the server only to see 'Prisoner has died' on my screen. K."
1	 please STOP WIPING out our characters. We are tired of running to loot spots."
1	 will update if the enjoyment persists over a longer period of time. I have high hopes !"
1	Very good game!
1	It is just an early access and every time I discover something suprises me !
-1	"Im not sure how i can say this without being a pee pee licker. Ok my name is jason and im 23 years old my dad was framed for killing my mom and i have to say his game has gr8 graphics. When she came home from work one night my dad was drunk... drunker than normal. The combat is handled very well for a survival game. I tryed to get between them but my mom said go to your room your will only make it worse. That night i heard my mom and dad yelling all night at eachother. The loot is not spaced out very well and it can take some time 2 find/craft ammo. The yelling stoped i walked out to find my mom laying on the groud with my dad standing over her lifeless body. ""Dad why have you done this"" My dad looked up and said ""overall its not a bad game but it needs work i can nor recomend it at its curent state""."
-1	TRASH
-1	Singleplayer is unbearably boring Multiplayer is a desync mess
1	you can kill a man and take a dump in his dead corpse11/9100% would buy again
1	Best survival game I have played so far through H 1Z1 and Miscreated and DayZ this one is the best (haven't played Arma yet)
-1	Jogging simulator. Good practice before going to track to understand the mechanics of resting between runs.
1	good for early access. Like Day-Z but with more customization .
-1	 I am no longer playing. I get PvP i really do but you can't mix it in with a survival game like this. I spent 4 hours just getting to the point where i could start getting around without starving or something else then ""IF"" you get that far you need to hide from any other players becasue even if they say they are friendly THEY WILL KILL YOU the second they get a chance. As you can see i don't write many reviews and i am a laid back guy that just likes to play games but this is just plain frustrating to spend 10 hours in a game and repeatedly just get killed. I will review again in a few months and update if its any better"
1	"A player called ""CTA /\ | \ H"" is hacking by appearing right in front of players while performing an action and killing them. He also cannot be killed. Please ban this player"
1	It's good but needs work
-1	 I hope that they fix some of the balance to make it a bit more managable."
1	The game is super fun and enjoyable and the pvp is well worked however the robots need a nerf or rework they are to overpowered.
1	 dont try running this game on a Potato"
-1	 and I don't want to delve deep into the survival game cycle that I have previously fallen into before.0/10 - Best game i've ever played."
-1	The defenition of SCUM.
1	 they are salty that they cant defeat a mech with a wooden spear."
-1	Not Liking It. Everyone Will Hate At Me That I Havent Played The Game Enough But Its Just Not My Game. Its Just Not My Type Of Game.
1	Holy hell is this game amazing.Anyone complainging about it doesn't understand what Early Access means...Easily one of the MOST polished Early acess titles I have ever played.
-1	zjebane
1	 I am refunding this because I dont wanna be let down again."
1	First and for most if you are looking to buy this game note that its EARLY ACCESS. Which means the game is incomplete so they will be adding or taking away features in the game. With that being said I went ahead a purchased this game. I was a bit skeptical on buying it because of what I saw on twitch. What I mean by that is the servers for multiplayer are not working that well and the game doesn't run smooth after awhile of playing it so you have to logout and log back in all the time. Besides that for early access I think this game has a lot of potential and has a lot of great features in it already. If you buy it I hope you enjoy!
1	yeah its pretty good
1	 you can eat them. 10/10"
1	 trnsport aroud the map is slow ( veichles need to be added) and players are glitchy af and just go invisible at random times..."
1	 it will over take all survial sims and be the top soon."
-1	 pubg and some others). I will not recommend this. Wait until it's released.-->never again EA"
1	This game is great so far and i hope to see more.PROS:in depth crafting actualy challenging going into a military base and avoiding mechs.grouping with friends is funthe controls are diffrent but feel really responsive.i love shotguns.alot more cool stuff to much to explain its a great survival game. single player too.zombies are fast <3<3<3CONS: some server issues lag or desync.no sit animation for campfire songs.not a complete game so cant really lay into the cons honestly XD:::::if you like dayz and arma 3 and stealth games this is a great game to play if you like pubg i would not recomend it for you. devs please dont be like dayz sa and fade away into nothingness XD.10/10 would buy agian.
-1	"
1	 multi player is a bit buggy. Needs anti-cheat."
-1	this is one of the worst games i have ever played in a while ...... i spent 2 hours looting for clothing and guns without ammo to then die from 1 zombie because i couldnt fight back i wish i can get a refund for this game
1	so many cheater now
1	 and impressive for an Early Access survival game."
1	 don't spoil ratings. Go to The forum. Search for help on the internet. Be a human. Devs are working so hard. ;)"
1	 or for alot more money when the game is later in the process :)"
-1	 but right now it feels incomplete.I would come back in a couple of months and check back."
1	DayZ killer confirmed.
-1	Tech-demoCould use more content and admin tools
-1	Game is unplayable for me. Grinded three time just to get killed by a hacker killing off the entire server and now when i go to look for a new server i refresh it and the game completely freezes. This game has potential but at this rate its pubg all over again.
1	 warp and get free kills due to thier bad ping (i.e. not fun even in EA). They plan to have anti-cheat ""soon""... Will revisit this review and change when those two items are resolved. I am giving them a thumbs up because I have had fun with it and want to wait for a more playable version- I am ok throwing some money at it and waiting."
-1	well you got my 20 bucks and it sucks so there.
-1	 potential is there."
1	I killed a bear and made a bear costume.10/10
1	2042 version of Dayz.
1	 but he was afk so I sat aimed at him for a moment he comes back panics tries to shoot but I was quicker to the draw and revenge was mine we successfully escaped after that.  THAT is my scum story."
-1	run run run run find no loot run run run run run find some food run run run run and die respawn run run run run get to friend get killed best running sim i played.fps in not the best
1	SSSCCCUUUUUUMMMMMGGGGGAAAAANNNNGGGGGGGG
1	 but to be honest I don't wanna spend 80 years meeting up with buddies to just die. Pros- Grahpically good- FUN- Not too grindy- Easy to learn but difficult to master- devs appear to care - The priceCons- could use optimisation- Desync in it's current state can be kinda bad- Could use more weapons and things (that will come in the future i'm sure)"
1	 keep the good work up and give us updates on a 14 days basis and you will have a successful game!"
1	 probably one of the best i've seen in this genre.. introduce crafting structures and it would be.."
-1	its so bad dont buy it
-1	DEAD GAME !!!
1	 im really bad totally unlucky and never got a weapon or saw an animal and im still recommend it.And one more thing for the future and especially now -> Fix all bugs and that stuff BEFORE releasing new content - THANK YOU"
1	 but you get used to it after couple of hours playing"
-1	 extremely in depth! Been loving this game so far!Can't switch gender type in character creation. Unacceptable in 2018. 1/5 stars."
1	This has real potential to be a good game. Wish there was a tutorial. Lovely graphics as well
-1	Standalone but with heavier breathing. Dont bother
1	 which can be really annoying when you're having any kind of moving fight."
1	 the game has potential. After a while when they start polishing up it will be good. Let's hope that wont take 2 years."
-1	crafting is an unorganized cluster f**k
1	Very good game but still in EA.Got this DayZ Rust vibe but 100* time more realistic and fun
1	Buy the game. Enjoy it. Take part  in the community as you can . Leave your suggestions. Respect the others gamers. Trust these Devs (real devs).And hopefully we will create one of the best gaming experience of all times!!!
1	Its early access so optimization can be hit or miss so be aware of what your getting. Otherwise its a super dope game if like this type of game spend the $20.
1	 cannot wait for the next BIG update and new things to be added. There are a few bugs but this is early access and I was very happy with the price."
-1	 dawg. Refunded."
1	 I recommend it. Otherwise you might want to wait and see how this game develops in the future."
1	i try so hard to find pokemon in this game but none appear i walk through gras for hours on end trying to catch a simple ratata but instead i find ash and his crew roaming the streets of tarkov and now im stuck at lvl 44 with no more missions what am i supposed to do i really enjoy need for speed but honestly no one plays it anymore think about it you race a few cars here and there and you end up capturing objective D in battlefield its very upseting and confusing i though this was 2018 i had a great lunch but it started to rain.......
1	io
-1	 because I really enjoyed eating fat and raw meat from a deer."
1	Got killed by a goat then a boar after reviving- IGN 10/10
1	It's early acces but so far it's highly polished for how far in development it is. It's not PUBG. It's not DayZ. I'm not even sure what the goal is yet but so far the gameplay is much more fun than many other survival or battle Royal games that I've played.
-1	 too much desync caused by the poor netcode + memory leaks."
1	Explosive diarrhea10/10"
1	 melee combat is wonky but not a game killer.. Mechs are scary.. Lots of potential with an active dev team."
1	Can chop up anything and then proceed to pee over it10/10 would play again
-1	The best way to describe this game would be PUBG after 2 years of drug abuse. Horrible FPS (my computer is not bad) on low settings and 0 loot. I have so little hours due to the fact that moving is quite literally not a possibility because of frame drop.
1	I pooped out a pineapple & then ate it. Money well spent.
1	 and it's only in Alpha."
-1	too close to dayz horible grey screem when youre close to dyign zombies are tanky as F*ck once big robots see you you cant hide behind a treee or in a bush you just get killed. STAMINA  is a thing makes the game unbearable of u need to run somewhere or meet a friend.
1	 I expect these issues to get fixed. The devs seem really focused on delivering a game that the community want to play and listen to feedback. The community also seems friendly which is rare in these kinds of games. It has some amazing potential and is a better DayZ for half the cost."
1	 titan x and 16GB ddr4 and i can run SCUM on stable 60-70 fps on epic graphics."
1	the game is worth it and by the looks of it can only get better. well worth the asking price :D
1	 meaning the developers are still adding things to it which will make it shine even more."
1	Great game !
1	 you could easily do a 4 hour sitting and wonder where the time has gone."
1	 but it is expected and acceptable in its current state while taking everything else into account.   I am very impressed and happy I purchased."
1	Great survival experience with a bright future.
1	 which makes players appear to be teleporting more so than walking. As well as hacking which I know they are already working on."
1	 if thats sounds cool to you don't heistate. Last I just want to is the ball is now in the middle of the court I look forward to reviewing it again in a monthly basis!"
1	 now that Anticheat is up should get better without the hackers.."
-1	Honestly  the game is hollow and barran for most people... but there is a great foundation here for something special. I bought and returned it because honestly I know  survival games just aren't my thing.  Maybe I'll revisit in the future.
-1	Don't buy this game yet if you expect a fair fight in PVP. The Pvp is broken. Players are invisible to you half the time. In theroy this is a good game but its for PvE atm. The Pve survival is good. Everyone leaving positive reviews are not metioning one bad thing about the game while it obviously has a long way to go. I have mentioned both good and bad.
1	Realy good Survival Game but pls fix the Problem with de desinc and invisible players so the pvp works better
-1	Until netcode gets fixed I can't recommend playing the game in it's current state.
1	 and I'm not talking about gaming."
1	 and plenty of content yet to be released. If you dont enjoy it in it's early access I'd recommend coming back in a month or two to see the game's progress. 20$ is very cheap for a game this good."
1	great game so many hackers ruin the game whats the point
-1	 will buy later if it becomes good."
1	 and still not bored probably the best survival game out right now!"
-1	 will be fixed soon) this game is a definite recommend."
1	This Game is like day-z but better would recommend 10/10 would eat a puppet corpse again.
-1	 it's really not worth your money and supporting early access."
1	 I really recommend you check this game out.The game has great potential and can't wait to see what's coming next!"
1	Young dumb and full of Scum
-1	 and with all the hundred constantly flashing and changing numbers- none of them seem to really matter."
1	 I recommend the game so that it may continue to grow and develop into the game we all dream about."
1	 there is essentially no point of going anywhere except for military compounds since all towns practically have are foodThese are the only complaints I have and so far I have had a TON of fun playing this game solo and with friends. I hope the developers continue to improve it as a whole and work to help the player base and community stay happy. I WOULD recommend the game."
1	Very good game yes!
1	 this game is EARLY ACCESS!"
-1	Nice hacker  gg this game
-1	 this was suppose to be my positive paragraph... As you can see this game has a very very long way to go.  I really hope the scum team can get it together and make an awsome game."
1	This Game If you can even call it a Game' Lmao Is amazing A one hit wonder The resurector Of dayz This has so much more devolopment to go into it but as it stands now is the best Game In its Genre!!!
1	Dont be fooled by people saying the net-code is bad it has been fixed unless you internet is trash its a great game if your not attached to your loot and dont mind hopping servers for some fast paced pvp. Its worth the money for what it is at the moment. 9/10 lost a score because of the netcode on launch.
1	 your character is quite impossibly in the way of the arch that is created when trying to do so."
1	Nothing.
1	I like how the default name is Ben Dover (Bend Over)
1	Please add cities instead of small towns...
1	SCUM
1	yes.
1	)))
-1	another bad net code game 2018
1	 7 Days To Die etc then your going to feel right at home in here. I am more a pve hardcore player but found myself with friends having such a good time in the pvp server. Even in its current state its excellent. The in game features are above and beyond what you get in any other survival game and are only going to expand. It's not perfect at all but its Early access and thats to be expected. It needs better optimisation but the Devs are to on it and have already done alot on week one to address issues. The back story is also great as your on a reality show like the old movie The Running Man. I don't myself have the lastest computer but have been running this fine. But it does have issues that they are looking into so I like many have had frame drops which you have to log out and in to correct atm. Overall an amazing experience and already had some unforgettable times with mates in stitches laughing at things going on in this game. So great solo or with friends. But I do recommend with a friend as this  is a great team game and so much fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ohh and the supporters pack not only are you supporting the hard working Devs but what they give you for it makes it well worth your extra cash and they say more will be added in the future."
1	 I recommend this game."
1	 once u have spent 100 hours theres really not much left to do. pvp gets old quick and pve surviving gets old just as quickly."
1	 and will only get better as it transitions into a fully fledged title."
1	 i really started to get into it.  I love it"
-1	Multiplayer is not working properly.
-1	 game of the complexity NEEDS F... tutorail.If you buy the game... you will be running arround like and idiot and after a couple of hours you will ask you self WTF am I doing here.I CAN NOT recommend to buy this game... the youtube videos are just commercials and have very little to do with the game. FAKE NEWS!!! :)DO NOT BUY"
-1	 my game is completely unplayable."
1	 only downside to the survival aspects."
-1	 seriously."
-1	Hacker is everywhere in this game
1	 more gun or more environmental encounter  maybe you already added but I have not seen it yet. Keep going. You're doing great and no need to be rush make it nice"
-1	 ""whysp.org."" Game was fun while it lasted."
1	 looking foward to updates. 6/10"
1	 the game has just entered early access stage. I feel positive beacuse i know the dev team is good. Thumbs up!"
1	Not sure why reviews are mixed. It's a good game they are clearly paying attention and updating it. Yes there's not a great deal to do right now but it's still alot of fun.
1	 it duplicated and now we have two magical eggs. Now we full of protein.10/10"
-1	walking simulator
1	great
1	 worth playing now and should only get better!"
-1	dont buy unless u like a wanna try a crashing simulator.
1	 along with admin command. All is right with the world."
1	 really enjoying this - the game mode events are a fantastic addition. I really have high hopes for the future of SCUM."
1	I was done with survival games...god dammit!!!
1	 very realistic survival aspects. I recommend playing it."
1	Day 1 and already better than DayZ.
1	 crashes etc. but overall is good game for now and i cant wait to see what future holds"
1	Early access this game have time to get better!
-1	Nothing to do yet <3
1	 be better when they add vehicles and bases"
1	What DayZ should have been. Hopefully the devs keep up to date with everything and keep polishing the game. veri gud game tho. 8/10 so far
-1	 I will wait for real updates and then update the review."
-1	This game is just terrible.. I've been playing it for about 5 hours and I havent had one bit of fun.. Walked around for ages found a few guns my guy is always starving i never find any other players I don't see how people say this beats games like miscreated.. And where the f are the vehicles! Wouldn't recommend this game until its been futher updated this is a complete joke
1	 I have a good feeling about it.-Goltrix2580"
1	10/10 this game is greatultra realistic survival is goodbut still looting houses and find nothing is thing that need to be fixed ... is there and possible thing to make that Scum to be on Croatian language?
1	Great and fun game some fps and server issues but would still recomend
1	you can poop everywhereyou can get drunkyou can eat mushrooms10/10
-1	 cannot recommend at this state."
1	nice
1	 i love it!!"
1	Haven't had this much fun playing a game since early Arma 2 DayZ mod.  This game is worth way more than $20.
-1	 you are not doing for free you just get paid from the people."
1	 I puked.   10/10 will play again."
1	already hooked.will be the best.
-1	Game was running before but now it is crashing on launch.
1	oof
-1	Scam*
1	Worth.Game is Early Access but devs are updating.Server problems are still bit annoying but overall great 30h weekend behind.
-1	 has caused me to lose 3 pistols so far.    Missing features. its an Early Access game so i cant complain too much here but there are a lot of useless things in the game right now that have features your unable to use as they have not been implemented yetit seems there are a few people not experiencing these issues with fps and bugs with different setups or are happy playing with lower fps than usual but i cannot speak for those people. i think there is a degree of luck with it at the moment. While i love the concept of the game and cant wait to see its future there is too much wrong with it right now. i will happily change this review in the future when the game is in a truly playable state. as a customer buying the supporter pack i hope it comes sooner rather than later."
1	 it's a breath of fresh air."
1	>chugged a bottle of whiskey>drunk af >killed a zombie with an axe>killed a donkey with an axe10/10 never felt so manly
1	Just buy it and thank me later
1	 7 days to die and so on is nothing compared to what this could be.BAM !"
1	Easily a good n worth game at 20$ Yes its pre alpha Yes it's creative and more coming Fun its alot like dayz n away but alot better Clever crafting system Short point of view its's easily enjoyableWorth the 20$ and fun with a group of 2-8 people Check it out 2hr or refund
1	 other players are in the game just to add a more realistic feel to the survival and give it another it factor i only run into a few players per session unless you go to airfield.  game is very in depth and has a learning curve but fun to learn also the roadmap and things that will be implemented seem like it will be a very full game"
-1	Servers suck
1	 still early access. These Dev bois are fast af."
1	 16/11 would beat again."
1	 I look forward to playing more and seeing what else is yet to come"
1	All fun and games till you bump into a ?.
1	Ding-ding-ding we have a winner.
1	one of the best early access games - betas out there
1	Eating way too much cpu no matter what you set the graphics to. still playable but hard to stream
-1	 just tedious."
-1	too buggy. Don't ask me to pay $20 to be your beta tester.
-1	Too early.
1	 Can currently recomend again."
1	 but I run the game at 25-30 fps  inbetween low and medium settings. Great game even for low eding machines !"
1	great game with a lot of potential 10/10
1	Its good for the price
-1	"I will save everyone the hassel and the money. This is what you get for $22.75""Failed to join Server""your welcome!"
1	Pretty cool so far needs a little work but gonna be a great game
1	 i see this game continuing to grow.  I am hopefull they will read and make some changes and fixes to what needs to be done.  Definately worth the price point."
1	zds
1	Already a lot better then dayz. Great potential!
1	Great Game cant wait to see what it turns into.
-1	 not right now. save your money and come back to it in a few months."
-1	 dont waste your game like pubg."
-1	dont really  like :(
1	 keep up the good work!"
1	Awesome game! Looking forward for it to be finished!
-1	How did I buy this mess
1	Good solid game at a decent price.Its not 100% polished but you'll get your moneys worth for sure.Vote up for a game not pandering to the lowest level skill pods.
-1	i refunded this after 90 minutes.
1	SCUm is definitely in the works. I can't get over 40fps and the graphics are not optimized. Fun to play with friends.
-1	 hold off for a bit"
1	So far is a great game  but to early to say. I hope they will impliment more things bu we will see.Here is a little previewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b1buwewmx8
1	Full of potencial. Actually pretty good for an EA title.
1	I really like this game! (a player from Just survive) its a fun game whit almost the same game ide like JS but more harder you mutch think alot more now and you need to get food and stuff like that one thin i dont like is that you cant create a party and play whit your friend in a  lobby... hopfully you can do that when the game leavs early accses
1	THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SURVIVAL GAMES I EVER PLAYED!!!!
1	 and I for one care to give them what little support I can for being so passionate about what they do."
1	 I'm really happy to be proven wrong."
-1	Game ran fine on Linux using Steam Play (Proton 3.7-5). Developers did however adopt Easy Anti Cheat and since then I could not join servers. Refunded.8350k 4.5Ghz980 Ti - Driver version: 396.5416GB DDR4 3Ghz4.18.5-arch1-1-ARCH i3 wm
1	 fortification etc.) and movement is really bad. The map is big and the entire game has a sort of a backstory.Would strongly recommend buying SCUM if you like DayZ and Rust but in hardcore mode."
-1	 WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! DNB GAME IS BROKEN GAME IS BROKEN... CANNOT CHANGE GAME RESOLUTION!!! WARNING DNB DNB"
-1	 this weird mix of both is just screwing the other part up. I regret buying it and would 10/10 refund if i still could. Atleast the devs seem to be active and responding to the community feedback."
1	 SO YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF A REACH AROUND WHEN THIS GAME RAW DOGS YOU FROM BEHIND WITH ERRORS.WORK IN PROGRESS"
1	 haven't done much solo yet. Good amount of loot. Doesn't feel to frustrating. The Puppets & Animals keep it interesting.Looking forward to further development of this early access game."
1	 keep up the good work!"
-1	no good
1	 this is the game for you my dudes:)"
-1	i tried it but it is not as expected
1	 delivered 21:9 Patch/Fix one week after release. 10/10"
1	Biology teachers should be proud of this game.
-1	 finding nothing and dying....its not that exicting at all. hope multi player is better and more stuff (weapons) to find.."
1	Great game. Huge Potential. It's very polished for EA. The bugs and hiccups are minor annoyances that occur in fully fledged AAA titles.
-1	 i run the game and it minimize and go down on the screen and i can not open it againWhat is it?"
-1	Presently I can't recommend this game as it's far too buggy. but it does show promise for the future I will change my review as time goes on.Wait a few months for the developers to patch and improve upon what's here.
1	Good game... but my PC sucks I have to run everything on low but still enjoying the game.
1	Its good but the mechs are straight the most overpowered thing in any game ive seen in my time.
-1	Realy disipointed been trying to play for the pas 2 hours and game wont cconect to any server at all
-1	Horrible Performance
1	 in a pile of my own vomit. Been about 10 minutes and im still out lmfao."
1	My microwave is having a problem running this game.
1	This is the game for you if you're a Survival nut. One of the smoothest launches I've seen for an Early Access game. Sure it has its bugs but its day 1 and they already put out 3 hot fixes. Would have taken years for DayZ dev team to do that. Map looks amazing. Great terrain. Must buy
1	I'll wait untila few more patches come out."
-1	 it dosnt bring very much new stuff to the genere at its current state."
-1	 I got a fisherman's hat! Now that's worth $20."
1	 it is easy to take that risk. The Dev's have huge plans and already they are showing their supporting nature by releasing a patch about 3 hours after launch to fix some connection issues. These Devs are hard working and they can be trusted. I am really looking towards what new content will be added. I hope this game takes off and gets more love than it is at the moment 30/08/2018"
1	 but mag aswell makes it a little too hard/slow. thats the only gripe.always seem to be hungry no matter what i eat.think my Energy and hydration bars are bugged too but its the first day!other than those small issues im definietley enjoying it and keen to play and learn more."
1	 that just sucks really bad. Can't wait for future updates though :)."
1	memory leak is pretty gnarly also the game is on the right track just need to focus on fps optimization for now if you are running a 1070-1080ti you may be alot better off as oppose to the people running minimum reqs and min req may be a little too minimum with the 960 the fram with everthing low as low can be 35-40 is max fps
1	 i really did enjoy it going around surviving and even meeting some randoms(eventually leading to us chopping them up). I really do believe this game has lot of potential and hope the devs don't just give up on this project like many other devs and their titles.Fixes I NEED :D - Server Lag is massive. 30+ players can lower your fps from 70 fps (what i get) to as low as 15-20 fps."
1	 Very buggy rn but good otherwise."
1	Awsome !
-1	 and you'll get a much better game."
1	 everything including the menu is pushed down and to the left. I have no idea how to fix this. All my video settings are set correctly"
1	 definitely playable"
-1	Why?
-1	Delayed for servers and servers down. Less troll and more work next time
1	rust and other survival games."
1	This new update finally turns DayZ into the pre alpha early access game it was always meant to b- *connection timed out*
1	Downloading Scum was a better experience then Ive had with Dayz
1	This game is awesome.
1	RIP PUBGshit and DayZ.
1	Great game
1	I pooped in sink and wiped my hole with my bare hand. I guess DayZ missed on that. 10/10.
-1	 First person has bad head bobbing and no way to turn it off. If I were you I would WAIT on this EA title."
1	 even the crap in the game has it's own movement and jiggle physics!GOTY 2018 and any year onwards."
1	Flawless.
1	 I hope they fix optimization next!"
1	 promising future for this game!"
-1	Server crashes every 5 minutes. Impossible to play.
1	HYPE HYPE HYPE!
1	Sh!t on people 10/10
1	Great game apart from the delay by almost an hour. Staying up late for this one carrrrn!
1	 this game is hardddd...one that you're going to have to invest alot of time into to be able to get in the higher ranks.(Next update at 5 hours)"
1	I am revering my review after dev updating the game. it feels good it got wrong on the start but getting better for each day but hackers is a problem u can hack with cheat engine rlt lol. But frome that the game is good i reccomend everyone who read this buy it but not the deluxe edition. you only get 2 ingame items and one mystery item when you poop and the rest u find in the game folder which is just images for u to print out what a scam of 8euro
-1	Shelter and fame points vanish after Quit game in SinglePlay Mode."
-1	 then pops out.. and youre dead.Is the game worth it? Probably. Will i buy it again? MaybeEDIT: I decided to give this game another Go and bought it the second time. I will be updating this review soon."
1	Worth it
1	Met a guy who was very nervous about my presence. While pointing his gun at me he directed me into a corridor with a door at the end and told me to leave. I started walking slowly towards the door. A sentry sniped me through a window. I think the guy was really sorry. If you read this: I forgive you!
-1	 unplayeable at key moments. Would not recommend until the game has been further developed."
-1	Terrible game
1	Cant wait to see where this game goes!Great detail and the game play post a great challenge so far.
1	Really fun game that evokes same feeling that i had while playing original DayZ. Incredibly active developers and nice community.
-1	UPDATED 09/06/2018If you want to play an intense complicated SINGLE PLAYER survival game then this is definately a bargin at $20.  HOWEVER....  If you want to play multiplayer and not encounter massive lag and desync problems then do not buy this as you will probably not be happy.  Check back every couple of months to see if the net code has improved.If you want to host your OWN private server to play with friends then do not buy this game as they have not made the server files available.If you have aleady rented a server that supports game switching and want to switch to this game.. then do not buy this game as only ONE server company is allowed to host the files.  Although the issue with single player save files was fixed this will remain a NEGATIVE review until the other issues are resolved.
1	good price.This is what dayz should be."
1	 making it easier and that you can place a shelter and box and rotate it etc. hope to see more basebuilding stuff :D"
1	 i know as long as the devs dont screw this one up it will be a big hit.crafting takes some time to get used to and a few bugs here and there but its toi be expected well worth the 20$!"
1	 with some elements similar and more survival things on top. Check it out and see if it's something you would enjoy.Thanks for reading this far!"
1	 I have more looting to do!"
1	Everything is good but dev need to consider about asian playerthey need official asian server to increase thier product consumegroup of my friends refunded this game because they are lacking of asia serverofficial EU NA EUW SA but still has no official asia server so im gonna wait for that and group of my friend as well.
1	"After the BS that was ""JUST SURVIVE""I was finished with any ""EARLY ACCESS"" titleBut SCUM changed all that for meGood game. Lots of fun.I wanna be a SCUMbag when I grow up!"
1	best battle royale game
-1	 Graphics are great and work really well however I found myself with nothing to do or worktowards. No endgame or progression content only having to look after your character? Which can spawn back on a friend for only 100 FAME. Personally not for gets boring quick."
1	 since this game is only early access I can let this go. I would recomend anyone this game it's a load of fun."
1	with a load of work this game is going to be brilliant !
-1	 and super speed. Dont waste MONEY or your time. Devs get your act together before releasing a game that is broke as all hell."
-1	 I have low fps in this game on low settings so can i refound this game"
1	"I really like the idea of this game. And pretty fine for a early alpha.  And i really hate all the crybabies. Seems like Most of them dont even know what ""early access"" means. Looking forward to future content."
1	 otherwise its a great game!!"
-1	 bots in this game are op its not even challenging its just unfair. All locations are basically identical. Game was fun for the first few hours and thats it."
-1	most frustration game i have every played.
1	 this place should look like something out of escape from New York the movie if its always being used as a gameshow.-ETC"
1	 the screen has zoomed in to an extreme. Now i am getting maybe a forth of the actual screen. I havent as clue on how to fix it."
-1	Game is such a mess atm it is unplayable
1	 monotonous lootin. So far walkin in nature sim."
1	best survival game ever.
1	First strategy RPG in years to allow you to pee pee poo poo
-1	 15 QUID DOWN DRAIN FFS!!!*******"
-1	 I wish I didn't spend 4 hours running around looting so I could refund it."
-1	 then I'm sure this will end up a great product. Hopefully."
1	 finest gameplay I've seen in a long time. The amount of micro is absolutely amazing.  Really strong graphics and gameplay. The crafting of items is a great spin and I'm sure there are plenty of hidden recipes as time goes on!"
1	 in what year 6? Lots of good lots of bad but I will not put anything down until the devs have time to do some work on their infastructure which they can;t test until well steam release. I peed in some guys pool 10/10 Would pee on you for free if you keep leaving stupid reviews!"
1	 nor have I seen a man take a enitre door way up to tell me he is going to eat me holding a shotgun to my forehead while I am looking out the window and him saying ""Fat albert is gonna eat you"" before blowing out my brains."
1	 good feel so far. Keen to see what is added as it progresses through early access."
1	great game plays great and waaay better survival then any other out right now!!!
1	10/10 Would Run Again
-1	Too many HACKERS!!!!! Don't bother until they fix it.  Killed this guy Blue Waffle and some Russian name like 5 times and they kept spawn on me.
1	 but it's not game breaking in any way."
1	 Survival Features all work and keep things interesting. Love the Detail you get through the Metabolism Screen and the micro management that comes with it.Hunting is really fun reminds me of Hunter: Call of the Wild.Controlls are great and intuitive love that mousewheel controls walking/running speed like Tarkov and Alt Free look like Arma. The crafting Mechanic is great maybe complex at first for some but great. Love that People arent bullet sponges.Melee is fun and works. Zombies work great and arent a mess like in so many other games of this genre. The Events keep things fresh if you get bored of basic survival. Performance could be better i think theres some kind of memory leak nothing that can't be fixed and Server connection is a bit wonky sometimes but also nothing that can't be fixed."
1	 great idea thoughtmore conect needs to come outbut for a beta 5 stars from me looking forward for more content to come from these hard working developers :)"
-1	 (watch?v=n0OUFVRyJbU)"
1	 man."
1	Good game
-1	 but I can't recommend it until then."
1	 plus a ton of other great things."
-1	"
1	Better than DayZ already.
-1	 so i cant even eat up cos the vomit animation stops him from eating."
1	 and the guy didnt make it. Better hit reg than Tarkov or pubG to DATE"
1	 additions and features."
1	I've only played for a bit but so far im impressed with the scope and design.  it runs smooth although i have heard of some people getting glitchy during gun firefights.  for $20 its a good deal.
1	 just thought they should know :D great game and will continue to play!"
-1	I excpected something different.
1	 they dropped the ball and made us pay for a brand new engine instead of the game. This game Scum is so more completed then dayz in EA. Worth the money twice over. Enjoy it people."
1	 play it for 30 minutes then ask for a Steam refund."
1	 but the baseline for this shows some absolutely amazing potential and for only $20."
1	Fun
1	 I believe devs will improve the game and optimize it."
1	I think that the game is very good and polished for just being releast but there is 1 or 2 bugs that i have encountered. the game just came out so dont be to harsh on it it is alread doing beter than Day Z.
1	It has potential
1	 i just wish there was controller support ( yes i know what your thinking) but thats my only problem. other than that 09/10 very good and a dayz killer for sure."
-1	 hopefully they make some much-needed improvements."
1	And is pretty real! (other than the zombies ;-))This is what DAYZ should have been... but NEVER got there!I look forward to whats to come with SCUM!"
-1	Survival aspect is amazing and fun. Hunting is cool...Pvp is a desync mess
1	 you guys get it."
-1	 but do know that its gunna cost you if you dont want to play on a dedicated server."
-1	 everything is lost.Week 2: repeat.Please nerf robot."
1	absolute grind but sure its alright
-1	Negative! fighting other players is like Dragon Ball Z They lag spike all over the place disapears and appears every 2 secs other then that youll likely walk around miles they should call this game walking simulator.
-1	 it doesnt keep my character from saying he is hungry. The only redeming factor of this game is the performance. It runs really smoothly. All they need to do is make ammo spawn with the weapon. Guns always spawn with no ammo or a magazine."
1	Great game so far. some bugs but with the dev's hard at work they will be gone soon. Continue the hard work guys
1	Poop and Pee simulator 2018 10/10
-1	Devs remove bad reviews.Game wiped today hope everyone enojyed that.Its legit a hardcore version of a more finished DayZ Standalone Streamer Hyped not as good as it looks.Early access.Toxic AF comunity as you will see in the comments.Do yourself a favour buy anything else :)
1	 and peeded.10/10"
1	 Stop being stupid."
1	 they give a single player mode at least so you can try to figure out what you are doing.  I'd say for $20.00 its worth teh support if they actually make a full release game as opposed to perpertually staying in development but still it is fun and at least different to some degree over similar games.  For now i'd say this is a stop gap game for me until Fallout 76 comes out."
1	 it's a blast to play with over 30hrs in at this point."
1	Fun with pals.  Looking forward to seeing the development of this game :)
1	 10/10 must own."
1	One of the best new $20 games on Steam.
-1	 but losing your character is just too much for me. I cannot recommend this game at this stage of early access."
1	Very detailed survival simulator with PVE and PVP elements. Visually it looks very good (especially for Early Access) and I'm looking forward to playing it more down the road when closer to release.
1	"this game its for people that know how to play SURVIVAL GAMES not PVP GAMES this is not a battle royale this game can be  a nice made day z in this game you need to survive from yourself and the open world pvp comes next if you try to play this game like a battle royale ""loot weapons kill get killed repeat"" you wont have fun and you wont like the experience."
1	If you loved playing Dayz in the early days this game brings that back. Also doesn't feel like it will be 6 yeards before it is done.
1	 and larger urban areas.Cheers."
-1	 I by far believe this game has beat all of the these other game that have a terrible launch"
1	 what more to say ?"
1	 especially compared to other games out there. Super excited to see more!"
1	 the evidence the devs are updating every day gives me hope and good feeling these are truly the right developers for the job; and know how to run the right game. Releasing a game with decent performance and little to no problems on launch with the exceptional visual and game problems is promising enough.Thank you for reading!"
1	Just buy NOW!!! and dont questionAnd WHEN I MEAN NOW I REALY MEAN IT BECAUSE THE PRICE PROB GONNA BE RAISED SOON!!!!
-1	its actualy scam not scum game is really unfinished and need some time to be much better ...
1	 it will only get better"
-1	 the game is dead already H1Z1 all over again dont buy"
1	Good so far and more on the way. Yay.
1	 if not thousands of hours on my account with this one!"
1	 it's been fixed a couple of days later.10/10 realistic10/10 survival feeling10/10 Dev's9/10 Server (some server are lagging if many people are on it)Best investment i did!"
1	when u play 37h on a server and wanna try single player or any other server u will lose ur character and ur gear every thing on the server u played on u need to fix that
1	 some initial hiccups (as expected) but still very very playable"
1	Seems like the cheaters are getting taken care of and updates are pretty frequent.  Performance is low at times due to a possible memory leak but the game is a lot of fun.  For a very early access game the bones here are solid for a stellar open world survival experience. Devs are responsive.  Lag issues are to be expected and can make pvp frustrating but overall the core gameplay loop is a blast.I would love more primitive living viability in the future before more guns and advanced technology to favor thinking over luck in looting....  but... still better than DAYZ.
1	for 20$ you cant go wrong and what is here now is great i cant wait for more big updates
1	 i think they will add more. Oh not to mention the diarrhea is lit af.I definitely recommend this"
1	i hope they fix the multiplayer mode and i need a secure of they downt remove the server and then i lost my progress  please you make a very good game make sure of few stufs i can buy again
-1	 wait until it works. Should of just deleyed it until next spring or something."
-1	 it took me longer to find offical us server east blah blah blah then actually playing in it since no search bar or a working friends tab. While actually in game for a solid while i was searching house after house for a single usefull item but would get either scrap materials for crafting which didnt work with each other or just nothing at all."
1	It will get better and better and better and then it will destroy humanity.
1	It has a lot of potential. FPS is pretty good right now. Combat needs some polishing and the UI is a little buggy. Really hoping the devs don't walk away from the game. 9/10
1	Can you guy please fix the FPS Leak. After some time the FPS drops significantly and have to restart the game for it to come back normal. Thank you
1	 especially with friends.people who are complaining are being a little over dramatic.ive played with no server lag and next to no stuttering.My game consisted off trying to live off dog and cat food then eating a giant bag of flour.ate random mushrooms and fungi in the forest (next time gonna eat way more magic mushrooms)shot a deer and chopped it up then a mech shot me into oblivion.plus i peed out of the window at the church tower and pooped on a kitchen table.10/10"
1	 fall over when running down a hill and give you a chase that a zombie should give.The map is huge and has great places to go such as bunkers that have good loot and have AI mechs that are ready to shoot you. To get in these you have to time your movements and open a hatch in order to get in without being shot once u loot it you have to get out and hope you dont die with the loot you found. there many more places with good loot and the towns and villages really only give common loot and they are less dangerous than going to a area that has mechs. The game is fun very realistic in every way. In the future the devs have said you will be able to fly planes sail boats drive cars and base build. You will also be able to have a medical skill so you can heal your friends.so far playing this game i have had a alot of fun and i have played alot of other survival games and SCUM even at this early stage is better than them all.I would recommend you buy SCUM and the devs are working hard putting out updates and listening to the community."
1	This game is all about manging your character's health food and other things. It is very easy to find food but he never eats because he is distracted. So he ends up with an unbalanced diet and health issues. But he won't stop playing this game!
1	I recommend this game. This is a great game and has alot going for it keep the updates coming plz. also trying to squad up with steam friends should be alot easer than it is but other than that once u get started theres not that manny problems becides some server lag once is a wile but still worth the $20 i do recomend you up the price to $25 or $30 and push out some more updates to keep the fan/player base happy keep up the good work and don't be a SCUM about it lmao thanks.
1	 it is far more fun when you have a squad of 3+."
-1	game is decent combat system sucks
-1	 and the rest of them had issues with framerate. The mechanics are fresh and new and I really enjoyed the idea but there wasn't much around to find interest in. I did a let's play of the game after five failed attempts and the game let me stay in after the third try but it took the HUD away. I like the game and I want to continue playing but there are too many bugs and not enough content.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shj-6JHKrbQ"
1	Very good game has a lot of things that need to be fixed but its only day 2 and i play on playing this game for a while. The game look better then any other game i have ever played
1	 it is well worth the $20 while it is that price."
-1	 but not being able to even join (or let alone even see on my end) a fairly server is just pathetic joke."
-1	Gameplay=GOODDrop FPS= Baaaaad
-1	 just a thought"
1	"SCUM is a hyper realistic ""No items found!"" Simulator."
1	I love wastness of gigantic map. Game is not easy. I wll never take my full refrigirator for granted after playing this game ;). I really feel like im in survival mode. 10/10
1	 they also fix bugs almost instantly."
1	A true survival game with a rich and beautiful map.
1	Good game for $20 and EA. I look forward to see where the game will go.
-1	 there is literally no way to tell if your hits actually register on someone with bullets or melee."
1	Already addicted with the little bit I was able to play tonight.Definetely reccomending to all my friends so we can all play together.
-1	 not recommended."
-1	Theres about 15 different ways you can monitor yourself starve to death
1	combat abit strange b/c of focus."
1	  It will be cool the have cars or bikes :)"
1	 DayZ killer for sure."
1	I can poop on a zombies face or in a friends shelter.Still an early acess but a really good and fun one.9/10
-1	 they also added easy anti cheat and has made the game much more enjoyable to play without the idea of a somebody hacking."
1	 your respite is here."
1	 so many elments of other games mixed into one and its again not even finished yet. I played hours with a buddy and was enjoyed every second of the game and for the price is well worth it."
1	 I have been dreaming about "" Prisoner leave this area immediately"""
1	 full of fun features. Recomended for everyone that likes survival games."
-1	BORING
1	i like the game it has a good idea and is fun. only part that can be a little annoying are the mechs but all that aside love the game
1	 player dysnce and what i believe is a slight memory leak after about 3hrs of gaming without client refresh. I have no idea of what people are calling ""end game"" loot for this is a survival game and there really is no such thing as end game. Realize before buying this game that it is EA and will only improve from here. Only cost $20 when i feel it shouldve cost way more. DayZ has bee surpassed and will never be as good as this. 10 out of 10 in my book after the current issues are fixed. Well done Devs. P.S Devs your robots aim snap needs to be adjusted. Tad op in the state that they are in. Just my opinion though."
1	this game is pretty sick! unique take on battle royale with extensive mechanics. if you are not ready to take care of your virtual body by pooping and peeing when necessary then you might not like this game.
-1	Bad
-1	creating the contant with friends so the running and looting is less boring."
-1	Gave me a fatal memory error everytime I tried to load in. Found 0 fixes. Refunded. Hope you all have fun though!
1	 but overall there is potential to grow.-Add Auto Run Hotkey/Toggle -Introduce Land and Air vehicles. I really could see this game with a plane and chopper. The views from high up on the mountains are stunning. -Fix them odd Micostutters and FPS Drops which require a restart. It can be underwhelming when you're getting so into the game. -Personally Loot distrubution needs to be upped some what. If you're looking for a more high pop server literally every town is looted and respawns are very slow in my honest opinion."
1	What DayZ could have been but better and more detailed.
1	 it has some optimization issues but the gameplay will make you look past all of that guaranteed. The future looks very bright."
-1	 and continue searching for the Sword of a Thousand Truths"
1	 but they did it. Totally worth a shot!"
1	 increase the loot and have at it. I think this is going to be far and away the best survival/pve/pvp game you will find. Bravo...Scum team....Bravo 10/10"
-1	 isnt hard ? Wish i can refund back my money. 30 min just for to find a server. And game play ? No content at all ."
1	woahhh
-1	tHIS IS PURE GARBAGE GAME! DONT BUY AS YOU WILL BE  VERY SAD THAT YOU SPENT 20+ FOR THIS TRASH GAME
1	 difficult to play in the same server as friendsI was able to drown underwater and then regenerate health afterwards. How is this possible?"
1	It's a solid game.
1	 11/10!"
1	 don't mess it up like half of these games do. What you have right now is pretty solid."
1	Ignore all the little kids complaining about the game.It is early access it WILL HAVE BUGS AND ISSUES... don't complain about tiny issues it isn't as if they have said they are releasing a full game. Buy this game it is worth the $20 for sure. The issues (small considering what a fail DayZ Standalone is) will be ironed out soon enough.the game as an early access is a 8/10
1	Its Dayz but not s*itAll around a great poop simulator.
1	Yes
1	 I've been following your developer videos ever since 2016!"
1	GOOD survival game that works with team or without it try it + it has big future coming
1	Fun game but not for everyone
1	 since English isn't my native language."
1	 put it this way if you loved Dayz for the game not the product and then felt stiffed by the devs as im sure we all do/did this is for you.Great jobs devs you got a gem here that is without a doubt king of this genre now."
1	 and thats exactly what it makes you do. There are events however that are like team deathmatch and you go in with a full kit and battle it out with other players but the base game is survival. I hope the devs stay true with the survival aspect of the game and don't join the battle royale band wagon. I feel as time goes along and as long as the devs stick to it the game will have a lot of success. In my humble opinion I think that the game is worth the $20."
-1	Not fun and quite boring
1	 and not as buggy. actually know whats wrong and being able to see your food intake and hydration intake is nice. But I died not because I was hungry but because i wasnt taking in any sugar... crafting it pretty straight forward. shoots nice. zombies arent stupid and dont glitch to much so you can fight and a dodge their attacks pretty easy. Player base is friendly right now (huge plus). Its fun. But just Dayz upgraded...or how it should have been. For $20 i think its a good game even if it doesnt go anywhere... Pretty boring if you alone. so bring a friend and that should be fun."
1	This is definetly the closest to a survival game i found where it is as close as to realistic it'll get maybe except the pvp part. However it wouldve been nice to know that there were female characters included as well. I dont mind playing as a guy but i mean guys are not the only one in a survival game as well.
-1	 work on the networking side of the game to make pvp workable."
1	 still enjoy playing after 22 hours."
1	 can fully recommend this game for the price. once they put in more stuff it will be awesome!"
1	 saw them and lit them up.>Stole their gear and continued to loot the bunker.10/10"
1	 I can say with total confidence that this game is deffinately worth your time if you are a fan of truly hardcore survival simulation. :)"
-1	NOTHING TO DO IN THE GAME DONT BUY
-1	BAD!
1	Scam is good!!! Lack of rides +and fortress crafting  but a good survival game... Graph are good too!
1	 hopeully these guys dont pull a dayz..."
1	 looting is a joke way too rare too find any kind of items.It barely makes it worth it for the price in my opinion"
-1	 which requires you to spend hours walking in a circle and only looting.I give it 6/10."
1	 desert eagle and revolvers)"
1	 hope performance will be better soon :)"
1	 then you can sell the fish at a market. Also a trading zone for goods and a general Market place in one location. Perhaps the idea of a Hotel where you can strip for money or spend money on strippers. Maybe a Hotel Brothel owner or an owner of a Pub where you can be taken over by other factions or syndicates. The world is the devs oyster with this game."
1	but it has the potentials to be maybe the best game in its genre.If you love stealth/survival/crafting games u should absolutely give it a chance.If you cant understand the meaning of E.A. just wait aprox a year and get it when version 1.0 is ready.Peace."
1	 and it encourages the recruitment of other players that have skill where you lack it.  There's more I'd talk about but I'm afraid I would bore those reading this. I will edit this in the future as more features come into the game so people can have a general perspective of what the game is like."
1	 but that there exist issues.. that shouldnt be a suprise to anyone ."

1	few bugs .. big potential ... performance is ok ... hope they stay on it !!
-1	just no
1	so far a great game can't wait for the upcoming updates
1	upgrade of dayz
-1	 but some of that is part of the game and I find that to be very broken and will give some people way to high of an advantage. Just make people visible if they're right in front of you."
1	No items found!
-1	same shi.........t as dayz
1	Was looting a house in woods at night when a guy came running towards me screaming something swedish. 10/10
1	 I'm extremely impressed. I can poop."
1	 still a cool game tho."
-1	Awful basically a walking simulator
1	Cream pocket.
1	 when using clip fed weapons you will need to find the clips to load ammunitionSimple squading systemEasy to read mapSpawning is a great concept just needs a little work with how much fame gives you what type of spawnPlays similar to dayz except feels a bit more polishedThe not so good:Loot feels a little sparse Lag is pretty evident although its an alpha so im assuming this will be addressedFor an alpha 7/10"
-1	  crashes and huge FPS drops are still there"
1	 id buy it now because i see the price rising"
-1	 I have to refresh twice to get under 50 ping every time"
1	Here we go Day z all over again.
1	 this game is great and has amazing potential."
-1	Bought 2 copies for my friend and I. Literally the worst game i've ever played. Not even going to reconsider this in the future. This is just straight up garbage. How are 45K+ people playing this?
1	 survival and resource management game .After dying 3 times I decided to watch a few youtube developer videos and learn to craft and survive - now I'm really enjoying the game - which when completed is going to be an amazing long term player game.Yes it's stutters and has memory leaks at present and I've had to wind down the video quality - BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S EARLY ACCESS."
-1	 but too punishing for it to be a ""fun game."""
1	 p!ssing also. Mech robot is broken. Overall awesome game would rate 11/9."
-1	 unless you're keen on paying for being a QA tester which I'm tired of with all these early access games that are released in this format over and over again in the past few years. What I do recommend is wait untill this game actually gets some content going for it and then buy it so that it doesn't pull off a Dayz as well."
1	What DayZ should have been.
1	Supporting croatian devs
1	RIP dayZ but on the real who tryna dous with me? dm me on steam if you tryna link to play
1	 you lose everything and have to start over from ZERO unless you stashed some goods away somewhere. The ""awareness"" system makes it indifferent to play in 3rd person or 1st person but it can get a little buggy at times with people randomly popping in even though they should have been viewable for awhile.Sound:Sound design deserves a special mention as it's pretty spectacular. The directional audio works well. Ambient noises make it genuinely creepy to run through the woods at night alone with headphones on.I will be adding more to this review as I accumulate more played time."
-1	 but it really isn't.. far under my expetations :/"
-1	 I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it"
1	 this game could become a masterpiece."
1	Dieting Simulator 2018
-1	 but this is not for me ....  I can see this game go like just survive.... way to much things for them to fix."
-1	Whos the retard that thought robots were a good idea(I'll put a thumbs up if they get nerfed)
1	Great game has a lot of potential
-1	wished they would have taken more time to fix ingame problems. Biggest Issue is the lag between players and the DC 10 x in a hour problems. Even if it is EA it's not playable at this stage of the proces. Wait a couple of months and if they fix it then i would suggest buying it. For now i'm asking for a refund because at this stage it's a waste of money and time.
-1	Performance as of now is god awful but otherwise has potential so dont buy now wait for fix.
1	 so yeah buy it imo...!!! gj devs keep up the good work!!!"
-1	 but not a lot to play with."
-1	 lagging on EU like i'd lag on Asia or Oceania. Otherwise nothing positive coming up."
1	 and did I forget to mention there's events for deathmatch/team deathmatch that you can start at a push of a button that anyone can join? It deffinitely sates peoples hunger for blood that's for sure ;)"
-1	Imagine the developers of Dayz standalone decided to focus on an intricate survival system and then forgot to add any real content
1	Goode Game i was wit frends in military then big man come and shoot us up 11/10. But serious is good game
1	 this is a GREAT buy!"
1	 H1Z1 and even a bit of Tarkov along with all it's unique features. It runs great on my 1080 SC 60+ frames. I've been playing on friends private server and probably only D/C'd 2-3 times during my playtime and it was a 30 second loading screen to get back in.If you like survival games this is a must have imo."
1	 16GB and a four y/o i7 CPU."
-1	Mech shoots through walls.0/10 ign
1	DayZ
-1	Game is pure trash
-1	another early acces survival game about gathering branches to make a little axe to chop trees to make another bigger axe
1	 just hope devs keep at it."
1	 69/10 would do again ;)"
1	10/10
-1	DayZ with numbers
1	Everything DayZ should have been
1	 while moving and switching directions you teleport around on everyone else's screen. There should not be this big of a bug on a game like this."
1	This game is DayZ But actually balanced and fun to play.
1	DayZ is dead and SCUM killed it.The Game has great potential.
1	 I will literally fall asleep or get bored within an hour. Not only that Dayz was not as complicated as this game aims to be. I understand for the sake of realism go make it as realistic as possible but understand that this is a game and so if I swtich over to the Metabolism tab and it ends up making me feel like I am trying to work the shower at a friends house then something isn't right. But it's a work in progress so I'd say the game is worth trying especially at how it was priced. :) 7.8/10 (for now..)"
-1	Lame...
1	This game is a really good game. If you have a group of friends then its even better and quicker but if your solo then you have to take the game slow. I have died 3 times so far and the second time i got killed by a cheat no cliping through a wall about 1hr before reviewing this game and i wasnt really pleased but as its only just came out the reporting will be abit doggy.
1	If you like survival game and you do have a great rig then just go for it !
1	Loving the game so far the devs did a great job. Proformance is an issue for me since i don't meet the cpu requirments but i'm working on it. Its looking like the best survival game out there right now.
1	Run into a town Try to get lootGet mowed down by a big robotRepeat10/10
1	It has great potential! I can urine on people 10/10!
1	 seems decent for the price. I give 7/10 for release day. Only thing holding this game back is server issues. Pick it up."
1	 a little bugs here and there but over all i am extreamly satisfied this game 10/10 would bang again"
1	although still in the development phaze this game will be awesome once completed
1	 you wont like this one.  Just because your favorite streamer likes and playes this game doesnt mean you will.  If anyone is looking for someone to run with me and my friends are always looking for new people.  Add me"
1	 a solid game"
1	 killing and managing your nutrients to survive. Will update later."
1	Very fun! Already seems more polished in some respects than day-z.
-1	I don't like the game it is too difficult
1	 for what it is it's nice."
1	 in eight hours me and my friend only saw one deer and a bear and we had been from d4 to to a1 so theres is no reson to see that small of an amount of animals.  and finally crafting (i know that there is a fix on the way but for now building a shelter is nerve-racking. the last positive is that the loot chance is good the way it  is!"
1	Thought process is good ....but laggy as hell....if process is good ...will see good things in this game in the future....Giving it a yes for the future no for now
1	Very good game!Only issue are the servers... random disconnects and laggyThats why i got my own server: 54.37.128.104:28402 EVERYONE IS FREE TO JOIN! Great community on my server so far! usually at least 20 people online.Discord for grouping up is also available
1	 its worth."
1	 hyped to see the future of this great game towards 1.0 and beyond!!"
1	 but you might as well buy it now before it becomes a better game and more expensive. So im just gonna give it a positive reviwe because it has potential"
1	 running away from mechs makes the game interesting."
1	Game did one thing right. Made me realize how good DayZ is compared to this horrible reskin.
1	 I'm happy to pay $20 before it will definitely cost more.It's definitely a hardcore survival game. If you like the idea of being able to cut your enemy's into pieces and the defecate on their dismembered corpse then this is the game for you."
1	 It hasn't."
1	It's a grind in the best way possible. Even solo player can be fun - and essential to find out what combo of gear you need to destroy those mechs. Worth $20 all day long and the dev team seem like they're really trying to work to bring this bad boy out of early access.
1	 the map is fun and has a lot of different areas to explore. It's worth the money if you're into playing survival games."
1	 but actually even more fun for the survival fan base."
-1	 THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED.I understand that this gane is EA but when im running around a town for an hour being chased my zombies only to find a rake as a weapon. This game has massive potential but its just not worth it at the moment. The zombies attack faster then you so you constants have to back away as you attack. You get hardly any loot from the buggest towns."
1	 smooth gameplay. Can't wait for future additions."
1	 thinking of all the close calls i had and of all the poor hungry fools out in the cold rain with no gear. With my belly full i decided to have one last swig of soda before bed...not realizing my tummy was full....like too full..... taking a sip from the bottle i began to violently puke all my din din on the floor ...hungry.....almost died waiting out the rainy night. Became the cold wet hungry fool i was just laughing at moments earlier. tomorrow night has me worried"
1	 has me really intrigued.I've taken loads of screenshots as the game looks gorgeous at times.It's best played with friends."
1	 can't wait to see what the future holds for this game and its players."
1	 but they clearly listen to the community.+"
1	I originally gave this game a negative rating for having server issues- it's now one of my favourite games on Steam. It's literally my idea of a perfect survival game
-1	 they are absolutely ridiculous"
1	squatting in an official slav approved tracksuit while watching my fat friend get KO'd by a bear. 10/10
-1	FIX that game lag FAST!!!!!!!!!
-1	 but in its current state its almost unplayable."
1	 the netcode right now is poor but there's potential."
-1	 so i start up the singleplayer. It throws me into character customization but half of the things are locked. After i finished ""customizing"" my character it threw me into the game without a tutorial. I had no idea what to do. The game is very buggy and really slow-paced. 10 minutes into the game i meet my first enemy and find out that the fighting mechanism is absolutely horrible. I can punch like two times and it drains my whole stamina. Behind me a few more enemies spawned and i got killed. I did not have the nerves to start over so i decided to refund the game and get my 20 euros back. The game might get better in the future but so far it is REALLY bad and i do not recommend you to buy it."
1	 a tribe or gang adding and more items to craft like building a base."
1	 for me it is everything DayZ wanted to be and MORE!I am really looking forward to seeing how much this game can evolve! Highly recommend if you like DayZ."
1	So I have been playing this game for a while and I am enjoying a lot. There are some problems but I'm pretty sure that devs will be fixing those. Interestingly looting is really fun. The crafting system is really detailed. Overall if you liked Dayz you will love this game. Thumbs up for me. I hope devs will be adding  and fixing more stuff to the game.
1	Better then DayZ by far.
-1	 and 1st peron FOV sucks."
-1	I dont recommend this game to anyone before its full release. Servers are laggy and buggy. Making a shelter or a base is useless only use for it is to respawn. Make more ways to store your items and make a way that you can store your items where only you can access them. Delete ADS without a scope since its useless and it only lowers your FOV. Add more pistols and more attachments to guns so we get a bit of a variety. Fix that mechs can sometimes see you through walls. I understand that making a Open World game like this is hard and it takes a lot of time to make it run smothly but if you are going to make a game like that you need to know that too. Also add more animals and add hunting sites where you can find different gear and guns and attachments as a place where players can go before looting a military base or airport and get a bit of gear for them without having to worry about players with guns and mechs.
1	 hands down."
1	 this will easily be a $60 plus game and be totally worth it"
-1	 ruined by trash people playing it"
-1	 and it is fairly reasonable priced so if you never played Dayz then you should give it a go and you most likely wont be to disapointed."
-1	 and thats coming from someone who bought EFT on release."
1	 has a lot of potential. But it needs more optimizing before I think about trying it again."
1	 the puppets and the whole TV Show idea are a fresh take on this over-done genre.Can't wait for more content!"
-1	 but this game wasted a good amount of my time."
1	 worth every penny.."
-1	 headphones."
-1	 and the last."
-1	empty..
1	 it still feels as though there isn't much to do sometimes. If more bug fixes are made and more content is added for players who are already looted for the most part then this game is already looking great for release."
1	This is realy cool game the graphice is excelent the game play is smooth love the game
-1	Not a lot of things to do at the moment really. very boring running around aimlessly looting places. not much loot anywhere else other than the military places. hackers are still a problem. net code is a mess with people stuttering all over the place when you actually see someone on the map that is. The skill levelling system is really bad. would take weeks to level anything up. on the plus side it does look really great visually. can't really recommend this game yet but hopefully the updates will keep coming and it will get better
-1	game doesnt work...
-1	 basically ran for the whole first hour of the game and found one zombie while everything else was looted. This game is not worth 20$."
1	 but the devs are great and i have 100% fath in them."
1	 and i mean quickly."
1	Great state for early access - great hardcore survival/pvp
1	 but nevertheless not good for hygiene. Overall this game is pretty cool and is the best replacement for all those survival-stuff games out there.9/10 looking forward to play this game after full release with all cool features implemented."
-1	 there is no point to play this game right now."
1	just buy it ... it worths all the money
1	People that are leaving negitive comments and barely any hours played just have nothing else to complain about. This game is great and can't wait for more stuff
1	Game is early access and lots of fun!I am extremely excited for what is to come in this game.
1	 it's one of the best simulated survival games."
1	 having to sneak into bases and and learn their patrol paths is extremely fun and scary at the same time and very rewarding if you manage to escape. Extremely fun if you get a squad rolling with some buddys highly recommend playing with at least 1 other person."
-1	 someone who'd profit from negative energy. You're not getting my money son."
-1	 freezes and all in all just a bad game."
1	 progression this game has it all. DEVS WHO LISTEN!!!! I have not been able to stop playing! Singleplayer is just as fun as multiplayer. 10/10 Would Buy again."
1	 spawn loot die."
1	Good
1	 to better optimize and add more content!!"
-1	 This game? 100% questionable. 20 fps btw"
1	when I got in the game was really laggy really bad game mechanics looked really good from trailers and streamers but i cannot recommend im gonna refund and wait till it gets better down the line when i can actually play on high settings with a gtx 1060 i7-7700 I can only play on low 60 fps not worth it I was hyped up for nothing*September 2018* As seeing this review from 2 days ago im actually having a lot of fun needs a lot of bug fixes and more optomization and this game will be really awesome so far its pretty good 8/10 worth 20 bucks
-1	 from my persepctive it's a thumbs down with an asterisk because it's alpha."
-1	 save your money."
1	i pooped off a dam
1	Been waiting for this game since 2017 and scum didn't let me down <3
-1	 wait until there's actually a reason to play it. Right now it's just a junky survival sandbox."
1	 will update review in coming updates of the game."
1	1000% WORTH INVEST EARLY. IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS
-1	Ill change my vote to yes recomend when anti cheat is added. A guy spawned on my group and had god mode and unlimited sprint.
1	 more backpacks seriously i looted 4 towns and never found one i had to go to a military compound to find a real one. Ammo is pretty hard to find and make. I look forward to future content such as base building vehicles etc a cleaner easier crafting system. Bears need to not go 95mph and fly through walls."
-1	thanks for the laugh
1	Bought SCUM > install > not enough disk space >delete PUBG > play
1	Pros: Beautiful graphics Huge map Great community! Tons of different loot (More to come) Thousands of servers You can hunt Bears and Deer! You can dump a load! Very realistic Many skills Ton of crafting Huge metabolism tab that shows you more than you need to know about your character Events for those of you who get bored of survival easily Working zombies unlike DayZ or ArmA 3 Exile mod Guns do a lot of damage Theres a tracking system so you can track players and animals Fully working digestive system that makes the game very realistic Group system allowing you to spawn close to you group members for 100 FP and many other thingsCons: Hard to join a server because of massive player flooding Hard to find food and ammo A lot of desync Respawning costs FP When you have negative FP you have to wait No backstory When you die your energy doesn't regenerate Robots can sometimes shoot you behind walls due to desync No other means of transport than running Took me like 20 slashes to kill a guy with an axe Movement mechanics are hard to get a hang ofGreat game with huge potention and hours of fun!I rate it 8/10
1	fun game just needs fps work
-1	 in its current state i wouldn't buy this."
1	Worth $20? Absolutely.
1	Love it Fun Game Cant wait for new updates
1	Props to the Devs for the intricate level of detail in this game.Once the server sync issues are completely fixed the game will be the best survival game out there.Highly recommended for the price.
-1	 not much to do and very little help getting started."
-1	 I'd automatically have to give this one a solid 10/10.But there isn't.  So 1/10."
1	Great game
1	Dayz 2.0 vibes. Already have had tons of memorable moments. Tons of potential.
-1	 kill and die. Its just a clone with overcomplicated mechanics. Pass until they've added more."
1	Lets be honest now.This a great game.A Great ConceptAND AN OVERALL GREAT GAMEOne problem though.unless you have a beast pc the game will be at a constant 30 - 40 fps.For example i have a gta 960all low graphics25-40 fps consatnt
-1	 I don't like scavenging for several hours only to be killed by some a-holes. No I don't want to rent servers to enjoy a game with my friends without pvp. Too bad I've played too long to refund."
-1	 trying to find the refund button.Game will be dead before it leaves EA."
1	 I would now recommend this game to my friends since they mostly use ultrawide monitors as well."
-1	but its clearly they releas this game without testing it there is no way they didnot find 1 bug will i found for sure 3 bugs within 1 hour"
1	Better Dayz
1	 also stay unique!"
1	BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED!
1	very good is fun i like
1	Great base for a good survival game. Servers suck atm tho.
1	Waited one year for it100% worth it
1	 if your tight on money or cant stand broken features and bugs."
-1	"""OPTIMIZATION"" a world that lots of devs have forgot."
1	 they have done a great job so far and I will see you in-game SCUM bag!"
-1	 he throws the gun on  the floor. Def was not worth 20 for this stage of early access. Will check back in next year when it should be where it needs to be for early access..."
-1	 and as I have a 8gb system I am having to restart the game constantly. I hope this is fixed soon as im starting to enjoy it despite these issues."
1	2 updates in 2 days Got random diarhea in a church10/10
1	 Running and Cupboard Opening Simulator 2018. Despite that I believe in a few months this will be well worth while as it looks great and the key elements are there they just need implementing properly"
1	 just beware that it has some bugs and server problems like desyncs."
-1	 but I now know that I am nothing more than scum for purchasing this horrendous pile of garbage"
1	Very nice game
1	game runs great feels like how dayz should be it is early access but worth it for 20.00
1	If they are going to wipe the server like rust the game will run dead fast...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
-1	twitch jebaited
1	Unique game .
-1	very bad. no hentai. no b00bs.
1	 game will be masterpiece."
1	 it is still very good in its current state. a solid buy."
1	better than day z
1	 and yes i would defantly recomend this game to freinds."
1	^<^
1	nices game must buy
1	finally sets up boxes to store lootguy floats in upside down and disappears30 seconds later a bullet from no where hits head phase 3 head truama10/10
1	 and going to the bathroom.8/10 in it's current state. (and considering the amount I've played) Would poop again."
1	This game is pretty freaking awesome for an Early Access! It feels completed already!
1	 tons of potential in a fairly stagnant survival market. DEFINITELY WORTH THE $20 PRICE TAG"
1	 servers are horibble !"
1	  980Ti still handles it in the 60 fps range https://youtu.be/FpaI8_ivkvY"
-1	 and I will continue to play when new features come out."
1	 or eat them or the other players you have killed. There are even churches to pray for forgiveness. Whats not to like?"
1	 i want to stop playing because i lose all items but i can't stop. I love this game."
1	 and join in ;)"
1	 and with the recent AntiCheat addition the game is about at a ""tolerable"" level. I look forward to further development and improved gameplay."
1	 the game is comlex and requires some time and patience to full understand and master.  Really looking forward to what the dev team has in store for this game and for $19.99...that's a 110% buy! If you are still on the fence about buying the game wait for more development to happen or a future sale."
-1	 refund here i come"
1	 or if you just have something to say in general.btw: I only did not reccomend this game because i wanted it to be seen by the devs and the majority of the populous. I know its a great game.Edit: Just fixed it. If your expieriencing this just exit fullsceen and then re-enter it. is accually really fun."
-1	I can't wait for the full release of this game because right now I can't even run it
1	10/10 Just need Optimization.
1	 takes some getting used to and theres a lot of bugs but its early access so thats expected. overall 8/10 would recommend"
1	nais
1	Most thrilling game I've played in a long time. Absolutely brilliant!
-1	 you turned my positive review into this.Censorship is not okay."
1	better than dayz
1	 with all due respect they sound Bleh."
1	 and all signs point that way this coudl end up being a great survival game."
-1	 the  game will not maximise to fill your screen.I will change this review once they have fixed this."
1	 i expect alot more great things to come from it. like cars and all thatIts alot like PUBG with out the dumb battle royale aspect."
1	Killed someone then decided i will poop on them 10/10.. totally Recommend.. from what i have played this game is awesome. Some issues with D-sync but this is early access. Big ups to the devs. Weldone!!
1	If you duck the zombies can't hit you. Shows potential.
-1	spending 90% of the time looking for food is killing this game. I know its a survival game but damn. How are you suposed to enjoy some of the more complex features. Im hoping the developers balance this out a bit.
1	 i feel like if they did figure out a sweet spot for PVP soon then they'll have a new big game. Thank you for reading this if it helped you at all like it and if it didnt dislike it. As all ways you guys are more than welcome to add me if you need tips for the game or possibly play with me your more than welcome :) thank you have a GOOD DAY"
1	"
1	 still runs and plays better than dayz."
1	 I got blocked by loads of zombies. You can't really move after one hits you so when I got hit by 2 each second I died pretty quick actually you don't have to go off my word I have a screenshot:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498739122You can chop people up which is very nice.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498684851 6/11 This game has a lot of potential to be the best game in its respective category."
1	 game isn't optimized or polished enough. Aint gona run smoothly on old pc but Highly recommended if you have good one. For me it's one of the best of alltimes. Great job devs!"
1	 It's still fun. And I look forward to seeing how it develops.  Fix the stutter/freeze issues. blow out the crafting system a little more and solidify the persistant world (per server) and you have a very solid game with room for A LOT of growth."
1	 the game that even in this stage is 10x better than DayZ.anyone who likes games like dayz should fell in love with this game."
1	LIKE DAYZ EPOCH MABE SOMEDAY BASE BUILDING or mods
1	10/10 would eat sticks of butter again
-1	 the game doesn't run well at all and the servers were deyncing like crazy and unstable."
-1	 i hope.. However as of now I would consider other reviews and a second thought before not only throwing money down but time down as well. Cant wait to see what it becomes. Ill update the review whenever its state changes for the better."
1	Awesome single player experience so far considering it's an Early Access game!
1	 it is going to be the best survival game ever. Although it probably is already."
1	Game cant run properly. I have more than enough to run the game yet there is constant freeze frames for me and it makes the game unplayable. Basically there will be times in the game where when ever I move my mouse the game will stutter and freeze. I like the concept of the game but in this current state i can not play the game.
-1	Much ado about running
1	 granted this game has been out on early access for a few days.11/10 would recommend!!!"
1	dayz but better
-1	 anoyed I cannot refund."
1	 hopefully the developers can take this game to full release and turn around what early access has become."
-1	 or base building."
-1	this game is litterally a joke. Laggy mess. Do not buy.
1	Haven't felt this feeling since dayz mod...  Welp here goes my life again
1	This game is an amazing game i really recommend it to any one thinking about buying it
1	 ARK and PUBG rolled into one. A ways to go due to glitches but for the price? FAIR"
-1	Trash
1	 and it can only get better.Would wholeheartedly recommend for the money you literally cannot go wrong."
-1	game meybey its not bad but its so much zombies and no food no items how you can go all homes you can find jackets or the S*IT so if you want try this game better dont try and donr waste your time on it.
1	 game has much potential i think and its quite addictive! Recommended in a good price."
1	Not played much yet but for a early access games and the price it's fantastic.
1	LOVE the game but can you make it stable to all the networks pls cause sometime is so lagging and killing people its hard cause of lagging pls.......i hope the next update will be much awesome and worth of playing. I REALLY LIKE THE GAME DON'T F*** IT UP OKAY!!!!!!
1	 why? Because I understand it is EA right now and I know that it is going to change quite a lot in order to improve the existing issues and mechanics; I am not at all concerned about the developers commitment here and they have already patched it quite a bit since release.I look forward to seeing what the future has to offer for SCUM."
1	 I'll start a fundraiser to get the devs put down and I'll sacrifice a dollar bill to Satan."
-1	fps be like yeah na
1	 it is very cheap and you will spend a lot of time playing it and you wont get bored of it in a long time."
-1	DayZ Standalone 2.0
1	 along with vehicles and clothing options and we have a sure winner.  So far I love this game and will continue playing it as long as it continues on an upward develpment path."
1	 have complete potato pc/ internet and struggle to run the game/ maintin decent ping  our server ip 176.57.178.69:28002discord https://discord.gg/C5z8Sbr"
1	 I havent encountered anything that makes me mad so far so good :D I would love to make more characters in a game soo I can play on multiple servers or 1 char for multi servers ."
1	 we need more games like this."
1	I like it so far. Bugs and all.Get this if you're a Dayz fan.
1	Not a bad game but its far from really good .Well all the things it does you can do it by modding arma 3 all other things just make it complicated .It is fun . The only thing im missing from this game is day night cycle .
-1	BAD GAMEPLAY...
1	 in today's society.Thanks for the hard work & dedication!"
1	 anything!"
1	 but my brother and I enjoy just surviving and looting. Dev's seem very active so that is a  good sign as well!!"
1	 its have nice future."
1	The potential of this game is amazing. Depth of detail which bring the amusment to the max. Already fun game for an EA & can't imagine it at full release
1	 already addicted. if you like the genre it's for you."
1	 which is par for the course this early and it's very minor in the long run.  10/10"
-1	 thats it. its a boring countryside with very sparce farmland and killing yourself is the only option to do that makes sense. save your money MAYBE if they dont take there winnings and run the devs MIGHT fix this all one day. but i bet this crap is it. play rust or ark if you think you might want this. there better and more completed. worse 20 bucks spent on steam"
-1	 I do not feel like the game is very fun or brings anything new really to the survival genre."
-1	Bad game hacking made it somewhat fun i guess
1	This game has been getting some incredible support. Patches everyday making you feel like you never knew a developer. Give it a shot.
-1	 trying to hit a player that is jumping all over your screen is pretty hard.other then that its good"
-1	 thank you."
1	 the only problem i had was the resolution."
-1	 if it wasn't for the ridiculous amount of running you have to do."
1	Beautiful :*)
-1	 game launches and cant get past the 10 time enlarged menu screen as I cant see the options or select anything. and game in unplayable. terrible."
1	Loving it soo far!
1	 initailly the servers were not great but within 1-2 hours everything was running sweet on my PC I built way back in 2011 (System specs are on my profile) and getting on epic settings a steady 60 FPS and dropping in towns but still very very playable unlike other titles.Awesome game with devs that are obviously passionate about their product and community!"
1	Found 2 people with my friendServers CrashRelogServers Crash againMe and my friend relog again and 1 guy is still thereWe kill another person and poop on their corpseGot killed passing a bridge10/10
-1	 but the game feels sloppy. Will return to the game in a couple pf months to see how the game has progressed"
-1	Game = Running simulatorFriends dont help
1	10/10Would take a crap in the middle of a field again.
1	 but he abandoned his own ship and let it sink getting worse and worse with each update.RIP DEAN HALLRIP DAYZ"
-1	This game has potential... but it feels like one of those free to play zombie games rn. It feels cheap and rushed.
-1	 not enough space here to write how nasty this game is even for a alpha!"
1	Pros:Its fun.So much customization for who your character is.runs pretty good for a early access at launch.its a survival game. cons:not fully optimized defitnely some kinks to work out but thats expected not a completely bad port so far.doesnt really fully give a turtorial for newcomers so finding out whats what is clueless atm.overall id reccomend buying and playing over time as it should get better. it basically dayz had a baby with just survive in its prime and you got this. give it a chance.
1	RIP DAYZ
-1	Lackluster
1	10/10 Like skyrim but with Croatians
1	 omg dirt cheap.Try it you might like it :P"
1	 character passed out and wouldnt get back up. 10/10"
1	 but they still need to fix some stuff."
1	 if you actually want a weapon then go to the bases with sentries and probably die.Beautiful graphics and love the guns!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB2ULwA7VyA"
1	This game is feature packed and i can't get enough of it
-1	 but I've moved on."
1	Pooping 10/10Will poop again
1	 they serve no purpose .. literally no-one likes them .."
-1	 2018."
1	 I mean that you can find a lot more than just hats (it looks like there one in every house). there's a lot of room to improve. Even though it is a multiplayer game it is really hard to meet your friends on the map so you often are running alone."
1	 but it is called a ""supermax"" game for a reason."
-1	 etc.. but when someone speed hacks up to you and your friends and shoots a k98 like an assault rifle I really wish I could refund this game.  Hackers all over."
-1	SERVERS SUCK PLAYERS ZIP AROUND EVERYWHERE
1	Great game for the fact that it is a alpha. Also you can do nothing wrong with the price. To play the game in high resolution a good pc is required tho.. I hope the developers are perfecting the game so the community can grow and the game can grow to.
1	 I grab a shovel. He dies badly. Poor fat bastard."
1	 crushed by robots. This game is awesome."
-1	dudes its a walking simulater. there was only a hand full of servers that hdd palyers in them.
1	Pooping on enemies +1
-1	 I have the reccomended specs."
1	 wait a couple of months. But for every true survival fan i can recommend it even at the current state."
1	cool and good
1	 beautiful graphics as well!"
1	 surviving... graphics is great."
1	It only took 4 or 5 days to run 32 hours in this game while i have a ton going on. Needless to say it's DayZ SA with a much faster start and better mechanics. Although some of the status effects are still broken.
1	I can poop apples. 10/10
-1	 all you have to do is hold W."
1	Not at toxic as rust. Enemies not as broken as Arc. Not as broken or deserted as DayZ. Simple to play and fun to play. Combat is very realistic and satisfying. Fun to sneak past Robots. Even thought its in early access it is very promising. Get it.
1	Best game yet.. keep up the good work
1	 but as they update the game ill update my review."
1	10/10 best game ever you can pee and poop
1	Needs a base building aspect of the game
1	Excellent game already worth it for the price and it's only been released for 2 weeks. If you like other survival games you will find this is more advanced than the majority of them
1	 kill zombies and run from merchs. Very fun."
1	If you like DayZ or survival games in general. Then you will like this atleast 10x more. It's just that much better and thats from after 2 weeks of Early Access.
1	i love thes game but its not for aver one mabe wach some lets play on youtubs ti see if its for you
1	Worth buying despite of the early acces state. If you played DayZ mod I really encourage you to try this game. You won't regret it. Can't wait for the final realase and I will check the game with every update. Hope the devs will keep up good work.
1	I like it!
1	Spawned inHeld down tab when i didn't mean tosaw a toliet clicked poolooked at my poo for 10 seconds trying to find itheld down tab againsaw a pee emote peed on my poo10/10 would poo then wee on my poo again
1	 due to it being early access and not the complete game yet. I already know it'll be up at a 10 before th year is even over if they keep on the current developer speed."
1	Good game poor optimization :/
1	 but I definitely recommend it."
1	I ate a horse. Horse taste good.
-1	Cons Multiplayer:1.) Multiplayer servers take long to load or not load at all.2.) Servers has no filters or shortcut to join of friends.3.) Hackers lurk in servers and kill you instantly4.) No Anti-Cheat system
1	 and so far it's been stable for me."
1	the game is alright but looting any type of military place is a pain the robots are way powerful which makes it almost impossible with other players and zombies you have to worry about which really sucks
1	very fun and enjoyable nice
-1	 don't get it. Otherwise get ready for:-Long moments of running between towns-Opening every box in a building to find a hat-Zombies that shake more then Micheal J Fox so good luck with headshots-Finally meeting another player (hoping for a friendly BBQ) but get shot in the head"
1	Ive played 800+ hours of DayZ and i must say that SCUM brings something to the table . Totaly worth a buy. One of the best alfa releases in years if not the best.
1	 there are bugs and memory leaks etc... but it IS playable and there is already so much to do!"
-1	 Or if it will turn out to be a good game in time."
1	 forget Rust and all other survival games. This one is the future."
1	The DayZ we all wanted. RIP DayZ Welcom SCUM
-1	Full of hackers already...like wtf...0/10 for now
1	 and it will only get better with time."
1	Pooped an apple then ate it. 10/10
1	 they seemed like nice fellas but i couldn't really hear what they were saying. I pulled my knife and screamed ALLAHU AKBAR and started stabbing one of them. Then his mate shot me in the back.10/10 would stab again!"
1	WORTH EVERY PENNY ! just make sure you have a decent system to run this amazing game!
1	elite game for elite gaymers like myself 10/10
-1	- Everytime Ive gone up to a person and pvped they just teleport. Big bug...- Server Pop - Server latency- Crashes - Player Movement- Player UI- Gun playPROS: You can take a poop and pee."
1	very impressed with everything so far! with a view QOL updates and a bit more content this game could be here to stay for a while
1	SO FAR..... The fine detail graphics are VERY GRAINY. It's very difficult to read the stat and any text because it's so grainy. Gameplay is good. Crafting good. Inventory good. Controls are great! The toxic KoS is alive and well.
-1	Game needs:- FPS Optimizations- More graphics settings- Fix of bugs which causes clunkiness in implemented game systems- Better UI for Server Browser
1	 it's really hard to be supportive!"
1	 It didnt keep attacking it retreated to a safe distant only for me to aggro it later and get knocked out once again."
1	"I like the game. It has a lot of potential. I have a ""streamer rig"" so performance for me is not too bad. The devs have already done great work so I trust them to keep going. For people with low end rigs I dont recommend due to the currently bad optimization. I will continue to support this game as I see massive potential in it."
1	 great work so far!"
1	really good start
-1	Dayz Garbage
-1	DayZ > SCUM. For this price is maybe worth but now its same as DayZ running simulator. But even gun play in this game feels like in WarZ if anyone remeber this game....
-1	terrible. GAME EVER.... I remember the first time i copied rust and seven days to die. Thanks for the waste of my money and time with and my 5 viewers... This game takes a special breed of person to play. I may un install the game completely from my super sweet computer. The end. PS I would like a refund. Thanks. PS this game is a joke.... Ps  dopnt play  this game.... PS this game is toxic... PS dont tpouch me.
1	I hope this is the DayZ killer everyone is dreaming of"
1	Good game for alpha if devs keep working it will be a great game
1	 but w8ing for patches.  R u f**king kidding me? Dayz+PUBG+ FP..... FOR 20$ - Amazing game!!!!!!!!!"
1	 got diarrea in middle of military"
1	this game has a high learning curve; yet it's a blast to play once you get the hang of this games super realistic mechanics. to the developers; you have made an awesome game that i know will stay number one for years to come.
-1	no fun at all unless you like [did not find any think]. and that you can not just play with frend's.
1	 what then? from the sounds of this game there will be a solid storyline with an ending for anyone who can juggle their health stats while managing to creep and loot up long enough to make it that far"
1	 I gave it a shot and I really enjoy it!"
1	 and advance and become famous that way with very little risk of loosing your life or gear."
1	 but I haven't encountered any yet. There is a bit of lag and desync which make shooting hard. Other than that the game is amazing.EDIT: Anti-Cheat has been added with the new patch"
1	 today they released it. if the devs stay on pace with this it can easily be the best survival game on steam."
-1	 I am glad that preorder wasn't an option.Refunded."
1	 I really enjoy it and hope for many updates and new things. Some more Asian servers and better Ping would be nice. Some BUGS but ok its early access."
1	>Found a gun.>Found a fellow inmate.>Pointed the gun at him.>Made him lay on the ground.>Pee'd on him.10/10
1	 has a lot of potential."
1	Im trying to enjoy it but pvp is all but impossible. Players lag all over the place. No matter the server i join when meeting a friend or another player the teleport all over. The animals do it also when they run away from you. Please fix this
1	 likely the server."
1	 because this game has incredible potential to grow."
1	Great game but official servers have a really bad desync since release
-1	 dont buy it now. Not worth it"
1	 with a bit of patience i feel this would be a massive hit."
1	>Be me >Fat Boy>Eat food>Start dying to zombie>Eatt Zombie >Yummy
-1	Ironic consonance with a 'scam' word.No content + empty mold for the game. If you want to be an alpha-beta volunteer tester and pay for this 'small money which will raise up after' - buy.Just refund.
1	Its okay.Needs more time.
1	i5 2320 3ghz 10gbs ram gtx 1050ti ran on full settings it ran well for me  its well worth 19.99 game still needs a few bug fixes and updates but it does well for beta i highly recommend it. but dont take my word for it or anyone elses try it out for yourself and sacrifice a few trips to mc donalds and get this instead... note: trouble with game crash uninstalling and a reinstall seems to help lag has decreased when installed on an ssd i will continue my study as updates progresses
1	 feeling sick. I should stay home n be a big scumbag."
1	 too slow to aim correctly."
1	Haven't seen the hard survival game like SCUM ages.
1	 my homies. Greetings from Croatia!"
1	DUDE ITS EARLY ACCESSS...
1	Even though Early access (The games Not finished for anyone who plays 0.6 hours then thinks they are a pro dev and start crying time to pull ur big girl panties up) I enjoy what there is to offer in the game. there is problems but every game launch doesn't  go smoothly me personally think the devs are actually trying their best to help the customer and build the game up around us.Sit back and enjoy the ride.
1	 I would recommend the game knowing its in early access and has issues which will hopefully be addressed"
1	 and it has a decent amount of content."
1	 and leaning over the roof and peeing on them. WIN"
-1	 worse."
-1	Quite boring.. run to a high tier area get looted and sit there... boring
1	 which I'm sure will be a lot of fun.I should also mention that you can play deathmatch/team deathmatch modes rather than just doing the main survival mode if you're into that kind of thing!"
1	 my tip would be: buy it in about 1-6 months if you want to play with some more features. But you could also buy this now if you want to get some experiance!"
1	 I was out for 20 minutes till i got my friend just to shoot me so I could respawn instead of waiting. They could add a way to make groups in game and a way to zoom in on the map as well as mark locations. They could also make the map feel a little less empty because you could end up running in a field for a good 5 minutes before you find a building. They also need to add seed to the game so you can make your own garden. The game still has so much to release within the next few updates."
-1	trash
1	 the only thing I think this game need are cars or something that can get you around the map faster than running."
-1	 but It seems to be terribly optimized at this time. Going to leave a thumbs down until I can run it on something besides low."
1	 i refer this guide... it helped me allot and have more knowledge about certain crafting items.  its a 30 minute video but the guy touches base on important information and early game options. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlft5vl9GI"
-1	 I would've just played DayZ."
-1	Wait until they fix this game and give it a reason to play. First negative review i've written on Steam.
1	 I appreciate the real time BP/CO2/RR/SpO2/EKG monitor and all the other cool metabolism stuffs."
1	This game is great! I see the vision and Im holding thumbs that the DEVs deliver. There are a lot of problems but as expected its early access. Keep those updates coming!
1	 needs a lot of work tho!I really like the scenery and the enviroment is beautiful. I like that is sort of realistic."
-1	 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I don't reccommend this game to anyone."
1	 but its EA so I expect to see the game change over time."
1	Some Bibba clapped my Cheeks with a pitchfork.10/10 Would Recommend
1	 or next to a squadmate"
-1	 NO server is true to its posted PING. Right now the servers are a ridiculous joke that need to be fixed before ANYTHING ELSE."
1	 has great potential considering how well its working this soon out the gate"
1	 its early access but IMO further along that most others i have purchased."
-1	 their servers cant contain combat. players would teleport across my screen with only a machete and kill me and take my 3 hours of loot."
1	Holy frriggin balls
1	 don't know which game they are playing.I'm playing this game on low budget hardware:-CPU: Amd athlon x4 860K OC'd to 4.4 GHz-GPU: Radeon R7 370 OC'd -other low cost hardware most of it OC'dBeen playing this game on Low to Medium. Even my low budget laptop with an mx150 gpu runs this game (NOT OC'd).After last update 20-30 fps boost. Been enjoying this game. It is fun with friends.BEWARE: EARLY ACCESS"
-1	 THIS IS WORSE THAN MINECRAFT ALPHA VERSION SO BUGGY; THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED ON STEAM"
1	 not so much. Still want to be a woman though. Keep up the great work y'all and for y'all reading this. GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!"
1	So. Ive been playin SCUM for a little while now and heres my thoughts.Pros:-Good Graphics (Beautiful Nature)-Not too hard-VOIP-UI is pretty good-very realistic (in some ways)-Big mapCons:-Many glitches-Already hackers-Too many zombiesIf you like DayZ you might aswell like this.7/10 - A better DayZ.
1	Few things to say:1- remember is an early access2- if your pc sucks don't blame the servers3- it's super funny and already playablebuy it!
1	great game love playing but it need a guild book on everything how to make tools and heal food base building if thats a thing im not sure coz theres no guild book and lag skipes in big towns or fighting needs work to apart from this great game buy it
-1	Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!Fatal error!
1	i enjoy this game yep...
1	 and this is just alpha so give the game a chance :)"
-1	I have to say im enjoying the game throughly and looking forward to this game being finished! Hackers are still ruining the game at the mo even with the anti cheat stuff that has been implimented. Once the anti cheat is fixed i would recomend this 100%
1	I love it
-1	 no matter how cool the videos look. The loot spawns is horrible and there are so many bugs and wayyy to complicated"
1	Amazing. Iv'e wanted this game for a long time now. Then when i saw it was available to purchase i snapped it straight away. Even though its still early accsess. Its utterly divine the devs are doing constant updates to keep the game rocking and brilliantly amazing. Graphics are spectacular and breathtakingly beautiful. Sure do enjoy this game alot..
1	This game is amazing and I would love for more people to support it and if you do get it I think it will be the best game you have.
-1	 animations are from 1998. Basicly not worth to buy at this stage."
1	played a lot of DayZ this is way better in my opinion and i think this game would be perfect if it just had vehicles and base building similar to H1Z1 just survive.
1	 and already is this game great. so far 9/10!"
1	One of the best open world survival games I have played in a long time.
1	EVERYTHING I WAS HOPING FOR
1	 then I would wait a little longer. There is some few FPS drops but not as bad as most games I played."
1	Scum is a very advanced game I still have alot to learn but for its first day out it shows amazing potential once they fix the desync i think Scum will be almost as good as the arma 2 dayz mod.
1	its getting better...
1	 then you will fall in love with this game. Just give it a try and see how it feels."
1	 head is red. No heals.Died from a goat headbutt.10/10 would play goat simulator again!"
1	 but community is more toxic then rust and now thats saying something"
1	Very special game.
1	This is what dayz should have been. Insane game 10/10
1	 for now i give it a recommendation but only because it have potential."
1	Love it so far! Keep up the amazing work guys! :D
1	RECOMMENDED EVEN AT THSI EARLY STAGE. hOPE TO SEE SOME KIND of progreesION THO. Rather than just do the same thing over and over agian
1	Day 1 of the release and it's already better than 90% of the survival games on the market. I look forward to what the devs have in store for us on this game; the potential is huge! For $20 this is an easy and definite recommendation for me.
1	 no lag. I became morbidly obese within an hour. Overall a pretty decent first day Early Access experience. For 20 bucks it seems to be a lot better than DayZ."
1	gg
-1	 character takes up a huge part of the screenI'd recommend skipping out on this one until it can prove it has the ability to improve it's base game more."
1	 a can of spaghetti and meatballs came out. I didn't know why but i think it was hiding in my good ol ""prison wallet"".  I got hungry and ate the can of spaghetti and meatballs.  10/10 i love this game."
-1	 wait and see if it improves overtime. Currently this game is TRASH"
-1	 but maybe a little too frustrating to keep you coming back for hours.I guess i'll try again tomorrow...."
1	Crushin brews and taking two's.
1	 I hope they already working on it."
1	 pee and vomit"
1	and honest opinion.Graphics: 8/10Playability:8/10Coop Multi mode:3/10Multiplayer Mode:5/10"
1	While pooping in the forest another random character came to me and peed on my face10/10 Would sh*t again in that place
1	 bang zombies. 10/10 best game ever"
-1	 once I set something down I need it 10 minutes later. Backpacks are abysmal. After you use your med pack from the first zombie and you get knicked by another zombie it's like 15-20 minutes to the next town.Conclusion: The game is rough but I supported this developer because they might do this game right and bring us the DayZ that never was?I will re-review the game again in a few weeks."
1	Good game
-1	A game about looting and crapping I'll be playing something else
1	 sometimes struggling tof ind people even in a full server. Could also do with a quicker mode of getting around such as bike until cars are in."
-1	This game has a LOOOOOOT of work to be done before it should be considered playable. It should have been worked out far more than it is before going early access. Maybe after a few updates this might be playable but now... not at all.
-1	definately wouldnt recomend yet.
1	 its mostly pubg kids who tought survival mean killing everyone as fast as possible."
1	 but has a TON of potential :)Do sth about the Cheaters and the thing that you drop your things in your hand when you use a tool with ""f"".  At least pop up a Message that u dropped your Weapon out of your hand. Would prevent a lot of frustration ... ^^"
1	Diarrhea hit me while having a gun fight. 10/10 Game
1	Great game with huge potential.
1	 I would recommend this game."
-1	 and that used to be the reason people played games."
-1	Well would be good if it would start maybe
1	 open for community feedback and skillfull enough to make this pearl to the best survival game"
-1	Game is Good but weapon loot is too low.I am looking for 3-4 hrs and no gun even small one.man we have a life we cant spend 6-10 hrs continue foe a decent loot.
1	 on GTX1070 and Intel Xeon E3-1231 running on Epic settings with 60-70fps. Keep it up"
-1	.
1	It's pretty good for being this early into access
1	 sometimes even multiple times in a day. Even on sunday. Unbelievable."
-1	Will change to positive once they add a autorun key and bigger servers since the map is way too big for 60 people...
1	Game is great. The Devs so far are great as well. Minor bugs here and there but nothing too serious. 10/10 for me. I'll see you scummy bastards on the island.
-1	 plus currently its just dayz but without any servers online."
1	 got an axe and thought I was a though guy so 2 zombies jumped me. Will continue playing this game and I can't wait to play it with my friends :)Have played Dayz before but this game is next level :) Great Graphics good design of the map."
1	 and hopefully it only gets better from here!"
-1	 even in early access."
1	mia dat 5 lei
-1	 and lube up!"
1	 great execution and amazing potential in the future. It is definitely worth a shot."
-1	 making view distance a bit pointless and ugly."
1	 so that haven't even put enough time into it to experience it all and therefore their opinions are invalid. Buy the game. Enjoy the game. Share your thoughts on where it can improve with the devs. Watch it grow. Don't whine like a b****. Pretty simple stuff there."
-1	 thats it. Comments will stay on because im not a puss like everyone critcizing the 'detractors' with their comments off after taking shots. just stop."
-1	 thanks SCUM)"
1	 just need to fix the memory leak."
1	 and the community is already as toxic as DayZ. Nothing but KOS. Spend a few two hours living on scraps just to start over again."
1	A lot like dayzz but the little mechanics in this game make it much more interesting than dayz and also the combat in this game isn't aids like dayz
1	 you can gain more weight."
1	 dont let us down devs"
1	 you can't see their arrow or position on the map so it's still a struggle to find them if you split up."
1	No Anime 10/10
-1	 which is a shame. Shoulda went with UE3 or an alternative. Huge disappointment."
1	 a fresh take on an otherwise stale genre.9/10 just based off the curent mechanics given to us in EA."
1	 pistols and plenty of food within the smaller towns. My only gripe is that high end gear is too easy to find in the areas guarded by robots.  Hopefully the game doesn't die like many other survival games before it."
1	has to be the best game for me up to date on first release yes server problems as usual but devs work hard and proving very good best fun for long time thank you plz continue so much to do and imagine looking forward to roleplaying on here defo a buy
1	What DayZ:SA should have been + some interesting mechanics.
1	not bad. one question how to become friends in game?
1	 but considering that my CPU is below the minimum required I can't complain.  Gotta remember that when you use an object (such as eating something) you drop whatever you were holding before and you need to pick it up.  It's hard to see in the grass.  Good there's a 'nearby' section in the inventory."
-1	 game is unplayable once a cheater gets a hold of you"
1	Tons of potential but they need to fix the desync and add lots more stuff to do and then it'll be GOTY.
1	 Great game so far. its hard to reveiw a game so early and it may change.It feels like miscreated but much nicer.Cant wait to see version 1.0Back in 12 months with a full reveiw ^^ Good work chaps"
1	Poop and Pee on the ground whenever you desire it. Best Game ever 10/10
-1	 where is team deathmatch???"
-1	 but time will only tell if the game will get better or if more content will get added."
1	 that bear -_-"
1	 with alot more to come. One of if not the best Survival games out there. Cant wait to see whats to be added down the line :)"
1	 well thought of and designed. But there are some glitches and bugs that need to be fixed. I DO RECOMMEND. PS Your character gets hungry a LOT of times so have some food stored!"
-1	 so assumingly you need to craft magazines? That's far too grindy for a game with permadeath.Has huge promise but right now feels like DayZ and PUBG had a baby and doesn't really bring enough originality to a saturated market."
1	Have only owned this game for 2 days and I have already sunk 25+ hours into it. Very fun despite being new and very addicting.
1	 already so much better than DayZ had promised it would become. And that in the early access phase."
1	 but if the devs keep working on it Scum has great potential.ROADMAP---   https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/0/1737715419889405829/"
1	 collect and craft things. I haven't seen a single zombie or animal in my 2 hours. For $20 it's worth it just fo fun."
1	Fun game Needs some optimization though
1	good
1	 play on private server."
1	Shut up and Take my money.
1	 THIS is how you do early acces game.Vozdra."
1	 but all in all game is great. You will enjoy it a lot. 10/10"
1	 actually solid gameplay for something that would even be released I think this game is awesome really fun I'm excited to see what they do with it looking forward to more features as it stands I'm still going to be playing this quite a bit! 8/10"
1	 facing away from me.PANIC SPRAY. He dies.He donates his submachine gun and tons of ammo to my cause.I beat the game. Log out to play later.Can't wait 'till someone wastes me from behind with a half-loaded pistol and takes a dump on my corpse."
-1	Game is fun. Too bad the servers are bad to the point you'll get kicked every 5m
-1	Looted for about an hour just to get randmoly shot through a wall due to the glitches xDJust needs some time to fix these things. Definetly see potential
1	SCUM is YUM
1	 but If some basic content like bases and missions aren't in by the end of the year I would uninstall and never reinstall this game. Been burned too many times by this genre."
1	 hope to see more updates soon"
-1	DO NOT WASTE YOU'RE MONEY the game is unplayable lags on every map i have a 15ping on the maps i go on and it's constant lag and bugs lazy devs
-1	 its just frustrating putting so many hours in and its a constant worry."
1	 but there's a lot to love here and it will only get better (I hope)."
-1	 the  pvp is shity and desyncy as well"
1	It really does not deserve all the negative reviews.Yes the game was a bit unstable at the beginning which got fixed fast and now its smoother in terms of desync.It is worth to buy it because it makes alot fun.
1	You're DayZ life extend here! 8/10
-1	why i can't gif this game to my friend? we stay in VietNam
-1	 When you're done I'll start playing again :)"
1	Great game concept and super fun. HACKING IS ATROCIOUS! Spent 4 hrs crafting and looting to get kitted just in time to get killed by a teleporting scrub who has nothing better to do than ruin a great game. Implement anti cheat ASAP!
1	its well put together  for a open world survival game but needs to have the issue sorted with lag in game
-1	 the action is really secondary here)"
-1	meh....
1	 Gold. You must remember this is ""Early Access"""
-1	RUN RUN RUN RUN
1	Amazing game!Nice one!
1	Great game
-1	"SCUM? More like ""the thought of my hardcase unit of a character stomping the teeth out of the knee-bending publisher 'Devolver Cringetal' is going to make me CRUMB""."
1	 I would find that to be nice."
1	 check back again in the future. It definitely has a lot of potential and the devs are off to a good start so far."
1	"""Prisoner leave this area immediately"" The worst nightmare of a prison"
1	 these people need to look through this and see the capability.It feels and plays great.Just buy!"
1	 they update fast and care about the player's.Will not hesistate to buy more DLC's in the future to support the game.10/10 as a survival game."
-1	 skip the game. It's just a another Dayz in a new shell. Demands a lot from your GPU to be playable. 2GB was not even nearly enough."
-1	 I just didn't have any fun."
1	 when they update th game."
1	GG!! Nice survival game.. Just keep it up to date..xDD
-1	costs 20 euros a month for a server. Maybe once it's released its better but don't buy it for now."
1	 I would love to play this with friends more than anything.  I don't like running zombies.  Zombie AI is a little off.   Overall I take a sip from the Early access tag and accept the occasional flaw as it's being corrected.  This game can be as fun as rust."
1	 i cant wait to see the progress they start making now that they are making money. Best 20 dollars on steam"
1	Man This Is A Blast To Play But Not So Much FPS Friendly To Someone With A AMD-FX8350 And A GTX 680 I Give It 7/Spaghetti FPS Could Be More Potato Friendly :3
1	great game
1	As of now 8/29/18Rig:GTX1080 (non overclocked)24 GB's DDR4 RAMi7-7700k 4.5 GHzPros:I can poop on peopleI can Pee on peopleRun from robotsGreat graphical visuals Unreal engine 4Super in depth surival aspectYOU CAN PLACE ITEMS FROM YOUR INVENTORY IN THE WORLD MANUALLY ANYWHERE NEAR YOUIn 3rd person you can't see people around corners (super cool prevents corner abuse)Cons:Laggy playersSuper bad frame drops when going near big areas (Loading issue)Gun loading and throwing spears in 3rd person.The .22 LR Rifle is literally bugged and you hold it like this: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5PQB69Ohnw/hqdefault.jpg
-1	 wait until release. If that'll ever happen and this doesn't turn into another Dayz."
1	10/10
1	 been waiting on this one for a while and as long as the devs keep updates rolling it'll end up a great game."
1	 highly anticipated and has followed through with my expectations."
-1	 atleast for now"
1	 i have a 1080ti i play most games at about 110-120 fps on max at 4k however on this game im getting an average of 65-70 with the occasinal drop down to 25-30 which is not great in a fire fight"
-1	Boring as hell. Tons of running and zero loot. Next to no PvP. Game is so boring.
1	Hello I know you are busy but I found another bug when I changed my settings my screen  zoomed In and now I cant acces anything
1	Great start to the game. Has a ton of potential. Ignore the 1 hour players. Those are review bots
-1	 cant use weapon....cant craft....cant cut tree though knife is in hand...etc. etc.i know it is in early acess but for now i would save your $20 and wait a few months till they sort this outnot sure if the servers are overloaded as well."
1	 vehicles. and especially Dedicated servers."
1	RIP DAYZ xD
1	 best come back when its been updated some more"
-1	 WAIT. It should get better."
1	 its a pretty good game especially for launch day. One thing though is it needs to get optimized soon. GTX 1080 after about 10-15 min of gameplay drops below 60 frames and does not go back up"
1	 they did much better than the dayz developers did in 4 years. I can definitely see this game becoming huge!!!!!"
1	Further along than DayZ which is pathetic for DayZ :smug: . Game has major potential to be something big.
1	Good game. Memory leaks at the start. hopefully will fix itself in the coming weeks/months.
1	 'SCUM' has a very promising future."
1	Had explosive diarrhea in the middle of a gunfight because I ate raw human meat and washed it down with dirty frog water. Good thing my squad had my back. 10/10 would recommend
-1	 but not unplayable kind of bad."
1	 give it a shot."
-1	bad frames too much info
-1	 but I cannot and support won't even respond."
1	 its a lot of fun with friends had my frames locked at 30 then had to restart to fix it. gunplay is wonky. This game will be really fun in the future when new content gets added."
1	pretty good game
1	2k18 version of DayZ. Absolutely enjoying this one.
1	Day1: DayZ killer righht out the door. visuals are top notch
1	 ignore the negative comments my experience has been A-Ok and I would highly recommend."
1	 I would rate negative but because it is still in alpha I'm rating it positive because from the effort the developers has shown so far makes it look like this game will have a great future as more features and fixes are added."
1	I care more about what I eat in this game than in real life
1	 there are some server issues but its still better than Rust or DayZ in its current state."
-1	 and contentless. Hopefully performance will be a little better at that point as well."
1	One of the best games i ever played
1	Deserves a double tap.
1	prepare to poop. again.
1	prepare to run half of them map you will get spawned in the middle of nowhere and you willl end up running half the map for some action and proper loot players are pretty toxic and selfish games bit glitch for now especialy the robots
1	 what about SCUM? If you don't like it now come back in 2-3 months. It'll be an epic game."
-1	theres chinese people hacking this game rn :( its a good game but to much hackers. In need of a better anti-cheat engine.
1	 better then all the games i played"
-1	 respawn (start over with nout). So far lacking in any staying power. I'll check back in a few months to see what improvments they have made. but for now don't bother."
1	great game but needs alot of fix/updates
1	twice better than dayz - this is my new favorite survival game
1	 needs netcode Work!"
1	Thanks to all who assited in the creation of this game. I'm glad you delivered.
1	MEH.
-1	Its Chinese scum hacking.

1	 all in all the game feels great. The cool mechs make the looting even more intensiv!"
-1	 found 1 and then we were seperated again.I feel they need to add a pre lobby for people searching.Refunding until more polishedGreat gameplay for pre alpha though"
1	 you will know what to do."
-1	Axe just disappeared in thin airway to many bugslost about 40 min of my life
1	 yes."
1	this is a good game but there are some problms about the servers when servers are full or has high players you and ur friends will teleport Constantly and it is a big problm cuz you cant hit the enemy from long range... secend problm is the echo of gunshots for example you cant hear gun shot from 100 meters away and its not realestic...third problm is the rendering distance for example you cant see zombie s from 65 metters away or you cant even tell the doors are open or closed from long distance... and you cant see building from long ranges ( some buildings ) even robots
1	Game full of cheaters ... Feels bad :/Game it self is grate do.
1	Verygood game
1	 a true piece of art!"
-1	Early Access? CheckSurvival? CheckOpen World? CheckZombies? CheckLooks like we got everything we need for a bland survival game boys.
1	"This is one of the best $20 I have spent. The Mount of game play you get and the quality of the game itself is amazing. The graphics are beautiful. The game play is deep. If you are looking for a day z ""killer"" this is it"
-1	poop
-1	 the lack of them mostly. needs a lot more time before its actually good."
-1	bad
1	Awesome survival game. Tough learning curve but well worth it. Watch tutorials on youtube.
1	 you wont like this game. or maybe you will. just get good. other than the huge learning curve. put the hours in and this game will make u a happy person."
1	Hackers and cheaters. Developers took no anti-cheat measures ahead of time. Cant host your own server you have to rent them. No base building only fortifying of existing structures. Sucks! RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER: ok I can do that. Even though I already returned the game for a refund i have been watching and you guys took measures against hackers. thats good. And since you guys are making a sincere effort to fix it i will change my review. I still want traditional base building in game not fortifying structures and the ability to host my own server. I will then possibly reconsider purchasing the game
1	isn't as bad as people say
1	 but nothing serious. Definitely worth twenty bucks!"
1	 just... it needs its time to fix some suff"
-1	This game has split personality disorder.... it doesnt know what it wants to be.... Right now its Fortnite/PUBG with some random DayZ/Rust elements that no one uses because the dont fit in..... what were they thinking.....
1	 all good!"
1	 play the event and when it ends get right back where you were. I think the game has huge room to grow but as it stands its a fun experience.Sure is differente from what Dayz offers (at the moment of this review)"
1	 its only going to go uphill form here."
1	 open a support ticket and help them fix the game. That's what EA is for."
1	 sorry for mistakes."
-1	 you still should hold off buying it unless you want to put up with an alpha"
-1	 couldnt run it comfartably on a GTX 960 i5 4690kI reccomend if you have a very high end PC"
-1	 player numbers will decline and the game will die except for some hardcore fans who complain that there aren't any new players.  I guess it is the inherent downfall of all these ""survival games"" that they cannibalize their own player base."
1	 no female character :("
1	Like Day-Z but actually amazing.
1	 but worth the $20!!!"
1	I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from because I played this game for about 2 hours last night running maxed out settings @2k with an i7 4770k @ 4.1Ghz and a GTX1080 and it ran smoothly with just one disconnect. Is this a good game? Does a prisoner sh*t in the woods? Hell yeah!As early access goes this game is in good shape.
1	 I recommend it if you're into PvP survival games."
1	 buy it before it's $40."
1	 get guns find players roleplay/talk to them have fun! Will be playing this game all weekend :)"
-1	 can't get past start up screen without seeing fatal error and then game crashing"
-1	Killed by hacker within first hour
1	 I wish it develops faster."
-1	 and obivously some anticheat. Don't recommend play at this stage."
1	So far i had a blast ...its need a couple of tweaks here and there but devs are really active they eventually fix and make the game better .note that you need a nice rig for now so beware before buying it
1	fantastic for an EA game. a must buy. game has huge potential going forward
1	only 7 1/2 hours. Not much. But i can at least say the game is worth the $20 by far. Obviously the devs will further update the game to really define the best parts of the game itself. Personally i feel the Mechs are too underpowered.
1	its fun
1	Very detailed survival game.  I love how specific it is about the body function and nutritional needs.  Requires a lot of patients if you've never played this type of game before.
-1	nothing to really do than just walk and run for hours and hours and hard to play with friends. Wish there will be more update to come. Let scum a chance"
1	 buy it and if you don't like it within two hours refund it and rebuy it in a year. I love it though. Amazing start for a small dev team in my opinion."
1	Devs are quick.Very happy with them taking care of the hacking situation!Thank you!
1	2 times better than dayz and almost half the price!-runs good-looks great-good amount of loot-other players have been funny asf so farhavent even played for that long but i would highly recomend
1	Had trouble in the beginning but the developers are working there butts off to fix the game by far the best survival game in a long time!
1	Really cool mechanics that other games could have used in the past! I love the awarenes/stealth/camoflauge aspects. Very cool
-1	No.
1	 etc you'll love this."
1	Buggy as expected but an amazingly made survivor game
1	Great potential.It's a proper survival game. Slow-paced. Thoughtful. Any game that makes you consider whether you need a dump before you take on a heavily guarded outpost is always going to be a winner.I actually got a hatchet to the back of the head while having a pish. I wasn't even mad.
1	 runs like champion!!"
1	Violent pooping simulator.
1	Game contains Tactical Combat Dumps and giant Mechs. 11/10.
-1	booooring ;)
1	69/69 i like this game v much :) feelsgoodman
1	No regrets =)
1	 an optimization patch is more than likely coming very soon. Will update this review when I get further along than 12 hours but as of now I highly recomend especially for any hardcore survival players looking for  a new game to sink your teeth into."
1	 killing him.We chop up our dead friend for meat. I out his head in my backpack. I give my friend his severed head when he responded. 11/10"
1	You can create and see your squad. Already better than Dayz.
1	 and be immersed in a beautiful world surrounded by danger and wildlife. And try and survive."
1	 cant wait to see what the devs do with this one."
1	 so good dev team to keep it going. Just give it a shot and you might be surprised...or wait until they optimize their servers."
-1	 and what is there is laggy and buggy.  Give it some time and it may mature into a game."
1	fun and good game
1	 I recommend this company and any of their products ever!"
-1	Games was good until I ran into 4 cheaters. Killed them first and they isntantly came back alive. Killed them 5x until they spawned and punch me to death and took my loot. Sad to see cheaters already in this game. Cool concept and hopefully they will patch these issues or it will be another PUBG cheating spree game.
1	 it is worth it"
1	 but we can already see that the DEV are already working hard on all of this on Day1 meeting other people in the game was horrible they were teleporting everywhere but already this problem look to be solved as I play today and never had a probleme to deal with anybody.so if you like this genre the you should definetivly give it a try and for 20$ in day1 for me is way better than a DayZ that been so long in early acces and offer such a bad optimized game for 40ish $ (sorry for mistake im not english)"
1	 but I heard that they will be adding base building later down the line. But this game is really amazing and it is worth the 20 bucks. Really good hardcore survival game with ok pvp."
1	Noice!
-1	 laggy. Don't waste 20 bucks to test their game for them."
-1	 boring as hell even when you run across someone and team up....they might kill you when shooting at a zombie with you standing behind them.....wrap your head around that. The game MIST is more enteraining then this."
-1	 I was REALLY hoping for more from this after seeing it was popular for a week or two..  Hopefully they can push it further but in its current state I can't recommend."
-1	I bought this game and it took 3 hours to run to my friend. Couldn't refund it afterwards. 10/10 would run in it again.
1	 I would love to see this game take the genre to the next level and add something like instances where you can make runs for rewards/ Loot and sort of move into a RPG survival game. but i guess we can just wait and see what the DEV's do. All and all its got a long way to go before its finished but i am excited to see where the game goes."
-1	Game always crash try reinstalling game now said message package corrupted. i want a refund or please solve the problem.
1	I have to say i like the game it feels like Rust with Zombies. I hope the game gets more content in single player or yes it does become a little boaring it could also have a little more teaching built into the gamr to learn how to craft stuff
-1	 poor execution."
-1	Spoiler alert........................................................................................................................................................................................................................... The best part of the game is the part when you get the refund!
-1	 but for now I've gotta downvote."
-1	OMG... This game feels like its made in the year of 2002.
1	I suggest the game it's great.
1	Very slow game but can be fun.
1	killed a bearate a bearwore a bearkilled a man ate a manthrew a mans head a another man
1	can't believe you take a dump with your pants onjesus christI LOVE IT
1	 does it better than Dayz I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone you will not be disapointed."
-1	 because of the sales."
-1	 but the game itself is fun altough food sistem sucks"
1	You can poop on your dead enemies....and friends! poop/10
1	most indepth survival iv ever played
1	Crap Your Pants Simulator 2018.The spiritual successor to DayZ that we deserve.
1	Literally watched someone get massacured by over 20 zombies simutaneously. Then got crushed by a robot.....
1	Dying of multiple diseases has never been more fun
1	 or clogged with trolls and abandoned bases on all the servers that make multi-player and co-op games unplayable."
-1	Meh walking simulator for 90% of the gameplay.
-1	right now   no...... but just support these guys.
1	i luv the game but my pc cant run it
1	 fortnite and dayz(mod) but who knows it might flop like dayz but i hope it doesent. this is my review of scum as of 2018/09/02 it is really quite i good deal for 22 dollars CAD"
1	 you can either choose to wait until the game is more stable or get it now and deal with the problems but i will still recommend it with all its problems."
1	 some minor tweaks and additions should make this a real winner."
1	 i'd say its definately worth if you like survival type dayz games. We'll see in the future how well it turns out. Huge potential and very fun with great RP elements. People who vote negative havent played hardcore survival games or hate early access games."
-1	 no complaints. The devs released a garbage game mechanic in their spawning system that makes solo play absolutely irrelevant and a waste of time. You can kill 2 players within 30 seconds of eachother and the first could spawn on their teammate in the same exact town as you within seconds. There is no balance between a solo player and a 2 man+ group. You could spend 8 hours owning everyone and a 2 man could respawn on eachother over and over again until they kill you by spending easily earned fame that they gained from killing zombies and baiting mechs. Until the game developers remove this trash mechanic of spawning on teammates without any sort of timer or combat detector the game is worthless to anybody who plans on playing solo."
-1	No Items Found!I don't know if I've ever played a more empty feeling game...
-1	REEEEEFUUNDDDDDDD!!!!
1	 and the night before they have been perfect with a smooth 100 fps on ryzen 1700x and a gtx 980ti. If you are in to hardcore survival games then I highly recommend you pick this up while it's only 20 bucks!"
-1	 then got killed by a hacker... twice. Good game.EDIT : My push to talk wont work"
-1	game is very unstable and feels unfinished in my opinion this game still should be in apha instead of early access dont get fooled by the streamers which have smooth 60 fps as theyre packing 1080ti etc this game is worse too run than pubg if i will see the game improve i will buy it again but as of current i wouldnt pay a single cent for it
1	5/10"
1	 but all I can advice is recognize it is an Early Access game and that it is not meant to be easy. 10/10 game in my heart want to see another survival game develope others I have played have gone stale for me."
1	ju8
1	has potentialbut with  700000 copys soldthats about 11753000 eurothey have to step it big up.
-1	Server wipes = Alt+F4
1	 DEFINATELY worth it!"
1	 because what they have know blows every other survival game out of the water in my opinion."
1	 also the map well done so much easier to play when i know im not running to nothingness.. cough day z cough... so yes defo worth the purchase"
1	 it has sold over 750K copies since release. impressive right. I would say its worth a buy"
1	 it is relatively hardcore and unforgiving. Can't wait to see where this game is at in a year."
1	"Really enjoying SCUM. I just got my PC yesterday and this was the first ""real"" PC game I purchased and Im throughly satisfied. Very interested to see what the devs do with this product."
1	Nice game :)
1	Dis game is Kawaaai.
1	I really enjoy the game even though I hate games were you can lose your items in a heart beat. It is really fun for even playing alone because of the zombies. I just hate the spawns like when you spawn miles away from a town.
1	 mixed reviews due to ignorance. Watch some videos! Learn what its about! We only get Devs like this once in a blue moon so dont miss out!Happy s|-|ooting and s|-|itting!"
1	So far I am having a blast playing this game. It is early access so people just need to understand that. the amount of stuff they have in it already is mind blowing.  this game you have to worry about food and not just food but what type how much. at the moment you have to run everywhere you need to get to. there is talk about adding transport I just hope they dont over do it I would like to see maybe trapping a Donky or a horse Bikes you have to find parts and put together I wouldnt want to see cars or humers but only time will tell. to the Devs Great job so far guys and girls.  If you looking for a survivla game you need not look any further this game will test you that is for sure
-1	Great game but I can't find any people to kill because the map is very very very big!
1	10/10 - Only because I can put a Zucchini in my short shorts....   will play again..Kind of Grindy.. but a huge map..  Great game!!
1	 i can really see this Very good game turning into an amazing one after a few updates and patchesi am really hopeful for the future of this game"
-1	`really hard not for people who just chill and ply
-1	 you can play this while waiting for DayZ full-release (soon^TM)."
1	game is  fun just need more fixing  like all games .should get it alot fun with friends.!!
1	Note to self:Do not eat zucchini that you find in a toilet in any video game ever
1	This game will be pretty good next year.
1	5 hours in and still to get to grips with crafting system.  Loving the game wish the squad mechanics was a tad better
1	 don't be like WildCard and PlayerUnknown. EDIT:(*)Memory leak seems to have been fixed.Keep up the good work SCUM devs!"
-1	Don't buy it yet
-1	 and game using EasyAnticheat  - this game is 100% unplayable cuz of hackers."
1	 right now. I very much expect a price raise (60 dollars or so) It is that durned good! Come join in on the fun!"
1	Highly recommend this game if you like good fun passed survival games. This game has alot of cool features such as the human body realism never seen in a game before from me which can be difficult but very interesting. This game has no building except a shelter and a storage box which is nice but maybe base building in future could be also cool. I love how there is a singleplayer feature never seen this in games like this before. NOTE dont get attached to gear because a Mech will awp your S h i t. Is it fun and worth yes is it hard yes is it worth it yes. What i dont see that should be added vehicles but it could possibly ruin the body system because people will get lazy and stop walking and running places so now everyone would probably be fat. Base building would be interesting too! is this more pvp or survival id say more pvp but is survival game. Cool guns and sheeet so i suggest buying this game looks fun but alot of lag spikes that ive noticed which can be a  A S S  breaker when being chased by Mechs or zombies. RECOMMEND BUT NOTE DYING IS GONNA HAPPEN SO DONT GET A S S HURT ABOUT YOUR GEAR BUT buy it if your down for some cool experiences. I honestly think that this game put Day Z the game thats a food simulator game pretty much to shame.
1	 sh*t. etc. So you must make sure your body is strong and ready for anything because if not you'll probably get viciously murdered and chopped up into yummy chunks. (: The first REAL survival game i've played in ages. Amazing concept and only getting better."
1	This game needs to add more zombies fix up some lag bugs while in combat and maybe more items and wepons in the game. Also add dirt bikes and quads
1	 my brudascluckcluckcluck"
1	Did some lootingThe metabolism mechanics are awesome - really fun to monitor intake.Drank an entire bottle of absinthe and passed out.Currently sleeping in the middle of the road complaining that I'm hungry
-1	 when the bugs are fixed and the dust settles it will be more than worth the money.Difference between this and a lot of other games is that I genuinely believe these devs will deliver on the fixes and content introduction. Can't wait to change my recommendation for this game."
1	First survival game I've played in all honesty but fun and easy enough to pick up in time. Looking forward to more content as the developers progress with it and great support for the first two weeks or so
1	 they will de-spawn"
-1	Got my refund!
1	i've played a bit and the concept is interesting.but it is a bit too close to real life. a great deal of tedium (walking for miles to get anywhere). a lot of dissapointment (no item found) and the occassional bit of intense excitement.looking forward to see how the game develops... it's a good start.
1	love it amazing game amazing graphics and constantly worked on
1	Better than STN (7.5/10)
1	Finds a rifle and 8 .22 cal bulletsPuts on a cool buckethatAll set and ready to go to get revengeSees russian 10 year oldAims and is about to shootThrows rifle away and has diarreaGets shot in the head10/99 would buy again
1	 residents of the Flat earth in the milkyway with the Flat Sun.Remember that this game will not make  you flat. It will make you FAT.The more FAT the more hardcore it is.Run up to guys with ak47 in light speed. Flank them in light speed. No logic at all mate.But remember kills = fun. If you have some common sense i bet you can get atleast 5 kills n hour. Remember if you have a friend called Bas he will take a long time to join.Thus you will be alone probably the whole night but that doesn't matter.You can enjoy jakenbakelive's streams while you play. Enjoy your flat earth life."
-1	 and then you try to sneak into a new location and BANG.I've been shot from an unspotted Mech with bodyarmour and a helmet and dead in one shot.Hours of play down the toilet.This wouldn't be too bad if you could go back and collect your stuff from the ground. But it disappears.The only stuff you have left is what's in your box. You literally lose everything.I won't be playing this any more."
1	I pooped on my mates butt when he was in  prone. Would sexually harasss again.
1	 most likely you'll run this game in a few months to find out its got a complete story you can play through."
1	Took a poop in the forest and a apple appear where my poop was. 10/10
1	Fun game for an alpha. Hopefully they won't DayZ this game but looks promising. The only thing I don't like is those dumb robots in the military zones but you just have to be sneaky and get around them. I like the option of single and multiplayer in this game so you don't have to worry about other players just killing you for loot.
1	 are perfectly implemented and they are getting obsolete by just shooting on sight! Please consider this befor you buy it! :)"
1	Best 20$ I've  ever spent
1	This game isn't bad at all but.. I do have have a little issue though...when swimming to get away from Zombies..They seem to be just as fast underwater as they are on land..It really doesn't give you the upper hand when leaving the water..because they are right on you..I hope they fix this issue..I'm playing it on single player and it's a ton of fun..even dieing lots of time..lol I say yes..this game is awesome..
1	 good game."
1	 here you go. 10/10 stop asking me about it."
1	The best survival game. I hope it will bring more and more fun to survivors.
-1	 i almost feel like its the same developers in disguise..."
-1	 but sadly it's the same as rust at this point. Very soon it'll be dominated by clans. I would not suggest buying this game if you plan on being a solo player; you can forget about trying to make friends in this game."
1	 it's showing a lot of potential."
-1	 But im sorry to say Guys It gets a huge thumbs down from me. Good luck with its future but i believe it wont have one. Buy Arma 3. or PUBG dont waste your money here Refund Me Please....."
1	and anti-cheat and buggs. The game is fun guys if you looking for realistic survival game SCUM is here :)Good Job Gamepires we waiting more updates :)"
1	 the game would have almost nothing wrong in my eyes"
1	skills and balanced weight triangle  Map detail Balanced loot tablesBalanced progressionShooting Movement Bad game mechanics / ishuse  Be aware that some of these could be patch when you are reading this Mildly steep learning curve  could be fixed with tutorial Broken camoflage skil e.g. seeing tent doors at airfield opening and closeing one by one with no visible player (I was close)I cant think of any thing more i geuss thats good"
1	 and this is game is a good attempt to take the lead! it is fun to play and realistic survival if you want it. I think this game is a HIT and will thrive if the dev keeps addressing issues first and content second. (as there is allready some nice anmount of content in it.  best 20 bugs on steam for me this summer!"
1	 it's currently in a state that is better than DayZ."
-1	"The game is good. Honestly it is good. But Devolver Digital removed the 14-88 tattoo from the game. You know... a game about the worst of the worst criminals? It makes more sense to have those tattoos in the game then to not have them. I give this game a negetive review because of that decision alone. Bowing to the ""gaming journalists"" doesn't make real gamers happy. True fans of this game didn't care and actually understand why they were there. BS move."
1	Edit: I was too harsh in my original review. Developer quickly fixed the ultrawide problem. Loving the game and very happy with the developer's response time and professionalism. Very happy to support this company!
1	Don't ever disturb a man whos is  pooping behind the bushor else he shall kill you and make your dead body as his toiled - Abraham lincorn
1	 countering hacks it should be one of the top priorities. A player base that can't progress will stop playing altogether."
1	diggin it so far
-1	so I played this game for an hour and in that hour I died 6 times to hackers killing the entire server instantly.
1	Best survival ever :)
-1	 I truly hope I'm proven wrong."
1	 everyone has a fair chance if they know what to do! its all about knowledge!"
1	 but what's that!?Suddenly everything comes up and I start puking all over the place.*BANG!*Somebody shot me in the head.Would get shot in the head while puking again / 10"
1	 and I am certain that is most definately coming. It's like what Dayz should've been. Goodluck to the dev's and I look forward to spending many hours in game."
1	 what do you guys expect from a  SURVIVAL GAME .  The gaming community should keep an open mind since this game just came out and should stop comparing it to all the other games on the market.  Through our support I'm sure this game could reach its full potential and become one of the best Open World Survival games on the market.  10/10"
-1	i had high hopes for it but it's like cancer for your computer
-1	game came out 1 hour late
-1	 I will gladly give this a positive review."
1	Very nice
1	 would buy new pc just for this game.6. Rip DayZ"
-1	 dev team doesnt work too hard (considering the ammount of locked content and game performance).Wouldn't recommend buying unless you have RTX 2080ti and an i9 to run it smoothly.CRAP!"
1	A Mech Suit told me to leave the area and then open fired and almost killed me while I was attempting to leave. I came back and took a dump in front of the gate and left. I will never not love this game
1	Pretty good so far
-1	 after I create my character and try to actually join the server I get immediatly disconnected and an error pops up in the main menu. All the Canadian servers got ddos'd for the past hour and US servers were down for about a half hour. Sadly can't write a review on the actual gameplay because it's not possible to access it.10/10 would play server menu simulator again"
-1	 apply patches quite quickly (thanks for HOR+ ultrawide fix)Will check the game here and there after a few updates and give a recommendation if/ once it hits a state where it is an enjoyable game worth the price."
1	help me fix my resolution it says its 1920x1080 and me recommended resolutionis 1920x1080 help fix please
1	This is a good survival game. It is very detailed with lots to do. Edit: Major improvements to servers. I highly recommend this game if you like survival games.
1	Great game!
1	Looks like they finally made decent progress on DayZ! This new update to Dayz is amazing so far!
-1	Would be great if you added a way to play with your friends and that is why i am refunding this c**nty game
-1	Game is ruined by desync hope the will fix it but for now it is not worth buying or playing
1	Really good game even from day one. I beleive it will become much more interesting in a couple of months.
1	 except... the mechs are OP so don't go near them."
1	 but don't buy it if you aren't mature enough to deal with issues that are expected out of and Early Access game.One hour in and I have enjoyed it and can't wait to see where it goes in the future."
1	I have been Scummed.
1	 dont rush it!"
1	 but come back later once they implement a reason to play."
1	 or - if you so desire - go pssiing around :)"
1	 have to restart  the game to fix it. Probably a memory leak."
1	Cool but need a lots of improvements
-1	nah
-1	The game is already riddled with hackers. I recommend waiting until release before buying or at least waiting until they fix the anti-cheat.
1	 I'm really enjoying it."
1	Amazing open world shooter with zombies and mechs.
1	this bad boy has a lot of potential. alpha but already addicting af. 8.5/10
1	 I'd say the game is definitely worth $20 in its current state if the premise interests you at all OR if you have friends to play with."
1	Great game :)Great DevsWaiting to see how the game unfolds.Netcode needs some work / Military gear needs to have alot less drops.Beautiful rain / scenery.
-1	 especially a BACKPACK!"
1	Good for an early access game.But wait for them to optimize it.
-1	game spose to be a open world survival game to me its just a full on pvp shooter game
-1	pure kak
-1	 game looks nice enough and intresting but to play it not for me!"
1	 something about the atmosphere and design keep you hooked. So bring a friend or make friends in game.Push to Talk- its a thing. Ive begged for my life a number of times........Fun Factor- Increases with people. Decreases with death. You wont be going back for your body with much success.Things I wish for- Sleeping aka sleeping bags or cots for logging out and faster recovery of HP. Also allow for improved                              treatment by other players."
-1	Just no. Im getting extreme frame drops with a 1080 ti.
1	 the game is worth more than $20."
1	 i still very much enjoy the game."
1	 the gunplay is pretty well pollished and the customisation looks to be amazing in the futre of you can make you char anything you wnt them to be a melle fighter a boxer a rifle man even a gun slinging pistol user. 8/10 will play again"
-1	 and thats if you don't die again by hackers.Avoid this at all costs."
-1	 not DayZ meets an overcomplicated diet plan simulator."
1	 I haven't yet played online with friends but I am so indulged playing on my own at the moment. So much to learn with the complexity of the game but I also think this may be its downfall to some players who just want to be instantly good at a game . this game will take time"
1	 my life in ruins. Where am I? What have I become? Nothingness.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwk-P2H8tOw"
1	 as well as Vitamins and minerals sugar levels e.c.t.Stealth is key in certain situationsPVP/ CO-OP MultiplayerSingleplayer (recommended first to learn the game)Day and night cycleWeather system in placeConsFrame issues every now and thenLag issues on servers is the big oneDesync issues in PVPRobots get stuck in the ground sometimes or run into eachother and get stuckCrash issues when refreshing seversGame freezing while lootingCan`t switch weapons sometimesCan`t join friends through steam (recommend you look up the server you want to play on together)Would like to see bullet dropPerks with fame points would be cool as they help you spawn in the same sector you died in if you have enough to spawn back in that sector.All in all though support this game its way better than DayZ and they are listening to the community with issues with their game. Think of all of us as game testers for the Devs. We are finding the bugs and polishing the game. I recommend you give this game a chance and there is a ton of potential.Update***Bullet drop and directional change is a thing I am an idiot."
1	 honestly its worth the 20$ don't listen to the negative reviews ( 100 x better then any others out )!"
1	The game that scratched my Arma 2 DayZ itch. Worth way more than 20$
1	 the robots are extremely over powered and not to mention the fact it takes you an hour to find a gun and then an additional 2 hours to find the ammo and magazine for it. The respawning mechinism isn't the best either especially if playing with friends. Hard to respawn near eachother and the more you die the longer you have to wait. I will continue to play this game as it develops but if there isn't many improvements then count me out!"
1	gets real fun when you play with friends and learn how to play
-1	As Great as this game is the servers are awfull asoon as it max out there is to much lag and teleporting making the worse combat of anygame ive ever played
1	 but very good game"
1	Is good
1	 it's such a well thought out and in-depth game. You can see that there's an awful lot of scope to build very detail modelling of behaviours and other systems into the game. Looking forward to a massive increase in the ""crafting tree"". And can see myself playing this for a considerable amount of time!Well done devs keep up the good work!"
1	 and playing with friends is really fun."
1	 this has done it off the bat."
1	10/10
1	 but it runs a bit better and has way more detail to the survival mechanics. Looking forward to see where this game goes!"
1	 and character progression aside from just loot. ive already had more fun with this game then i ever did with dayz. This game i hope will develop better than dayz and it seems like it will."
1	Puts Day- Z to shame thank you for actually making a playable survival game. Cant wait to see it completed.
-1	 and just so many disapointing mechanics missing or just not working."
1	 and nutrition more than my own."
1	Better than most games of the genre were when they first launched
-1	game worked at first now it doesnt. just no game crashes cant play but a few min then crashes and nothing saves.  well i guess they are taking the money and running im done with this garbage
-1	Played it for a short amount of time and actually loved it - my PC on the other hand had to go to rehab and get clean. Such a messy installation and the files are spread everywhere. Going to try again after the next update.
1	 besides that the zombies sometimes glitch through walls.i see a lot of potential here! only time will tell if this is another title to forget or not!"
1	 it'll be a backup game. I truly look foward to seeing what comes next. Developers are active and showing interest in the product even after a massive payday."
1	 my review shall be revised to fit in all the final game stuff as well."
1	 let's remembers its early access. Buy it now before the price goes up."
-1	Removed Nazi tattoos but wont remove AI superior Mechs who commit mass genocide against human beings support the rise of the terminator. Also wont remove fat people shaming from game as the game currently supports the false theory that healthier people are faster than fat happy people. Its basiclly a racist Alien robot loving game
-1	a terrible game at the moment broken and buggy. Just another cheap dayZ clone
1	 its x1000 times better."
1	I definitely recommend it if you like survival games :)  ( Rule #1 :Don't forget to poop/pee before battles :D )
-1	boring
-1	 we'll see what devs will do."
-1	 than SCUM is for you. Otherwise I recommend steering clear until at least 2019."
1	9/10
1	GOOD GAME WELL POOP
-1	except that dayz took much longer to grow tired of"
1	 getting chased by zombies then killed by a mech all with a AK with no ammo. FUN! Server needs to be improved 40 ping and get server spikes. Good FPS with a GTX 1050. I Think you have the top GPU you should be ok. Eats up a lot of resources due to my guess poor optizimation. But once optizimation and people with low spec computers complain. (I wonder if they will help low/medium specs users) I will really play this game non stop. (once cars are in)"
1	EA - but I really like the gameplay!
1	 it made us puke.7/10 would puke circle again"
1	ive played for acouple of hours. i enjoy the game but is there a way to help new comers with crafting things? ive found the resources i need to do certain things like build campfires etc but i do not know how to implement them. also what are tips to energy management? my energy levels go down fast and i cant figure out the simplest solution to regen energy. ive tried eating whats in my inventory but its usually not enough to rebuild. if there is a discord or chat that can help me get a better grasp on the game please message me!
1	good first impressions. fighting zombies feels nice.
-1	 you lose ALL of your Fame Points (your level)...yeeeeeah. Better fix that quick smart Devs."
1	Good game
1	 got explosive diarrhea. 10/10"
1	 and there will be much added soon. This game has potential!"
1	 but it would be nice for us who don't have the ability to play online with friends all the time. Keep up the good work devs!!"
1	1000% WORTH INVEST EARLY
1	 but after a quick patch the game ran awesome. only bug i have experienced was zombies stacking and being pushed through walls. game overall is exciting and worth the 20 dollars i have paid. ignore the Thumbs Down reviews because they all are the same. Game is currently 0.1 dont expect a complete game.Will update every patch. Cheers and enjoy the Dayz Killer."
-1	 just something to try and keep the player focused on their character to make up for all the missing content in the game. i dont even feel any survival aspect to this game at all besides some lack luster crafting just to get you started before you rush military loot. sure its early access but its just so bland. cant even run this in 4k without 3/4 of my screen being concealed and unusable so im stuck to play in a tiny 1920x1080 windowed mode."
1	 I've had quite a bit of fun despite my being a bit of a dumbass.I do wish ED-209 would stop murdering me though."
-1	no content other then keep running and looting.
1	...I like it!!
1	awesome game some glitches and bugs but can be expected with early games acess deffo worth the money tho very entertaining game from the off solo or with friends.
1	Love the game however didnt recieve any of the bundle items :(
1	Great conceptGreat DevelopersGreatGreat great Greatill edit this later if i dont forget
-1	Once Again Hype game same old shiz..... Just dayz again same clunkyness videos make it look 1000 times better than it is .. save your cash! just HYPE HYPE BS again...
1	Dont judge this game after just 1-2 hoursi had to play about 4 hours before i decidedand it is really funthe devs also seem to be working hard on iteveryone who says this game isnt finished and is another dayzITS EARLY ACCESS!!!!what did you expect and on top of that its been out for about a weekyes this game could end up being another dayz but we will have to wait and see what the devs do
1	The loading screen is already better than Dayz
1	 the server search system needs to be better!"
-1	 and 8gb of ram I ran 35-45 FPS on low and medium also the game has a ton of stutters for me I cant recommend this game to anyone who has these components or worse maybe if u like had 1080 but otherwise nah fam dont get it I waited so long for this game but ima have to wait longer until its finished"
-1	 polished game."
1	 it's true."
1	Had a blast in this game
-1	Dayz with robots but still no purpose to play this survival game the RPG elements add nohing new to the genre
1	More solid than dayz already
1	Dayz 3.0 EZ LIFE
-1	Won't allow me too access the game .... Seems to be window locked or something tried deleting all files and all still won't do anything !!!! P.O.S waste of 20$
1	Let's me drop logs on my dead enemies 10/10
1	 kudos!"
1	 cause it's fun."
-1	 running one hour to meet nobody and die... thats how you play.  just another scam as was with h1z1 they will stop it at some day.. h1z1 survive was best for some time but they stop working on it.. so yeah dont buy another scam.  lesson learned ."
1	 thumbs down"" review sytem does not work here."
1	One of the best games i have ever played.This will be EPIC when it has all the features!!BUY THIS GAME ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT A SNIVELING BRAT THAT HAS NO IDEA ABOUT GAME DEVELOPMENT
1	.
-1	 you are lucky to relocate your corpse to claim your stuffBasically if you want to play a carbon copy of every other zombie survival game and convince youself that its different because of the title screen this is the title for you."
1	 you're going to sh!t."
1	Recomend this game to all haters of Scum. Fanboys of DayZ im sorry if the game lead you that Dayz could be this great but do you know something? It won't. Roftalmost 6years is too long. yes its true there is some flaws but in comparison a game was release has complete not Alpha or Beta it still pretty amazing for a small company hehehee.Peace and Scum to you all
1	Meh. Probably gonna be another H1Z1. Hopfeully not.
1	I like it.
1	 i recommend this!"
1	 it keeps lagging and sometimes I get terrible lag spikes that keeps freezing the game for 5 secs. I hope they fix this one quickly as well."
1	 but they should be more dangerous."
1	 it's a blast.However probably my biggest gripe with the game is that there is still no way of tying people up and knocking them out. I think those are going to get added soon though."
-1	 but not worth the money right now."
-1	Game Lockes up while playing. Very difficult to play as you become over run with zombies and cant out run them at times. Game should have difficulty level for those that have trouble with this kind of game. game is not optimized either and should have a tutorial to help you understand the game. AS of now I think the game is a great concept but poor delivery. I will try again in 6 months if the game is still here but it is not balanced for newbs like me.
-1	 bc this game is GREAT. (And i will rate it back to ""good"" on steam ;))"
1	 devs have built a solid base for a survival game. Now comes time to tighten everything up and to start to add content."
1	Looting simulator 2018
-1	 bad prices"
-1	 I might try it again sometimes"
-1	This game is poopoo. Random asss guy comes at me with shovel hits me in the head and says to me noob as I spawn.1/10 would not buy again.
1	There is barely anything in game yet and its already a blast! I can't wait to see what they do with it!!
1	 it shows that they really are trying to make the game better."
-1	Hugely overrated. It's 'metabolism management simulator'. And 'box opening simulator'. Tons of gamebreaking bugs. Right now i can't recommend it. I'll update this review in a few months. It has potential but right now it's cancer.
-1	Multiplayer should not have been released without server files and in a better state.
-1	if they keep wiping server they arent going to have any players come launch date
-1	trash
-1	- Very in-depth but annoying metabolism system- Horrendous melee combat- Gun Combat with absolutely no weight behind it- PvE enemies that see you from 200m away and kill you in 2 hits- Unoptimised stutterfest- Annoying point system that punishes you for dying (In a game that you die a lot in)- Other players rubberbanding really hard on local servers (even though they are locals as well)- Literally just DayZ Standalone 2.0
1	 can't wait to see what they have in store in the coming months and long term."
1	This Game Is Awesome
1	  next to the camp fire where some horse meat is roasting and the amount of Brownwater that came out. That meat is not tainted but my bowel movement and poor decisions. Brownwater = Sh itt"
-1	Really bad game unfun but its ea so lets hope would not buy at this stage
1	 i like it (:"
1	 and God bless SCUM (and the developers)For early access 9/10"
1	 10/10 would recommend."
1	My friend and I were starving and looking for food.-Saw a boar and shot it.-Chopped it up into so many pieces of steak and fat-Ate a lot of steak and vomited.-Took a dump.-Ate more steak and fat-Vomited and took dumps for the next hour10/10 would pay to spend time taking dumps and vomiting in a game again
1	Great game soooo atmospheric plus graphics are great and is pretty well optimized and very good to play with mates.For a earliy access game that just been released its very good. Cant wait for them to update it more.
-1	 you can get a refund. I have a decent computer and couldn't even play at 1080 resolution. Yet I can play other titles like battlegrounds on high graphics at 80+ fps."
1	very fun. dont listen to all the negatives....they are prob fortnite players
1	when he gets up he flies up in the air and breaks his leg upon landing. God I love this game 10/10.PS I pooped on his head when he was afk."
1	 like playing Arma II - Epoch/Exile again."
1	 and success will follow."
1	 it manages to top some of the more well known and more developed titles in the same genre."
1	 I found a big suprise.I sh*t out a can of spagetti and meatballs........I proceeded to eat the spagetti and meatballs.The circle is complete."
1	Played it few hours there not much wildlife for food but when you do get one you set for food for days.Played on offical server died to player after hour after that was fighting another but lived found a donkey killed it and made every structure (basic shelter fire and box) within few hours so good but needs more things to do but has potential
-1	 maybe. DayZ knockoff with robots.  PVP is just as bad as dayz was in year 2 of development."
1	 they can shoot this game to the top."
1	 i've betrayed and i've pooped in unthinkable places. I rate it"
-1	 don't let the fanboys fool you. Another terrible ""survival game"" to add to the pile."
-1	This game has serious issues. It has potential but the desyncing is ridiculous. Once that is fixed there might be something here but at this point in time the game is too broken to play.
1	 but these problems has nothing to do when I was infiltrating in a bunker and I spot another player coming after me. The sensation of tension and adrenaline through my body was  unpayable. If u enjoy simulators and survival  it is a must buy."
1	I'm in love with the shape of SCUM I'm in love with your scumpy
1	 DayZ how it should have been."
1	 I like scum. Wish they hurried and addded vehicles already."
1	 7.8 turds rolling down my shelter roof out of 10."
1	Pretty solid keep it simple and solid push to keep the pvp part playable and the game will live
1	need to make a fire drill or have a lighter...its just such a cool game...but needs improvment"
1	 zombies and random players to run across? Check check and checkity check!The development team has been truly killing it with listening to the community and pumping out rapid updates. This is a $60 game that's been marked $20 by accident! Cannot recommend this one enough."
1	 that would be it.Over all SCUM already offers so much more than most other games within the genre. I am greatly looking forward to the future of this game.8.5/10"
1	My character was a serial killer who cut off the feet of his victims and took them to Footlocker and secretly stuck them in random shoe boxes before he was caught and went to prison.Now he hunts other prisoners and carries their feet to the footlocker at the top of the mountain. Eventually the mountain will be covered with boxes full of feet.10/10 would go to Footlocker again.This game has the potential to be amazing if the developer doesn't take this Early Access cash and run with it.
1	Very nice game and amazing graphics.I highly Recomend this game and enjoy playing with your friends.9/10
1	 you won't be disappointed!"
1	This is the best survival game I've played. The devs actually communicate with the fans and are pretty quick to patch issues in the game. I think $20 is an absolute steal.
1	This game is great for an Early Acces game!so here are the Pro's and Con'sPro's:Large mapVery good graphicsbeautiful landscapethe dev's update the game very frequentlyA lot of nice PeopleFun to exploreyou get to smell your hands after you take a shtConsVery laggyMelee Combat is almost impossible with all the lagThe Vitamin system is still a bit brokenThere are currently no cures to all the diseases meaning the only way out is a bullet from time to timeThe Mechs are very glitchy and also like to shoot you trough a wallBut other than that it is a really great game and i really recommend buying it!
1	 and nostalgic to the old Arma 2 DayZ mod days."
1	 from bad optimization to the lack of vehicles to travel the ENORMOUS map(they plan to add these AFAIK). But the base game is very fun especially with a group of friends.I honestly don't think for 20 USD you can get much better.7/10 (but an easy 9 if they fix the server lag and optimization)"
1	a game with huge potential. the pvp is fun and i hope that future updates will bring more weapons & other weapon attachments.10/10
-1	Game is good but desperately needs more map densityAlso fix this terrible memory leak that makes your game run poorly after a while playing!
1	this game is great. there could be some improvemnts such as bug fixes and patches but the concept behind the idea is great. it is defenitly worth the investment. on of the best games this year so far in my oppinion
1	 DEVS! <3"
1	Cancer
1	 they're planning on fixing things and I trust these Dev's."
1	 16 Gigs ram but i still dont get 60 fps Hight settings - 47 FPSEpic settings - 49 FPSmediuim - 32 FPSlow - 31 FPSDoes anyone have a tip? ive tried all the BS ''FPS BOOST TURTORIAL'''s but i still don't get good frames..."
-1	stupid mechs crafting is boring too. i do not recommend at all. its stupid like the croatians"
1	This is by FAR the best early access survival game that has come out.Ever.Now that being said there are some bugs and some things that need balancing but overall for it only being release for like what... 3 days? It's a fantastic game with a ton of potential.I will update the review if the devs abandon the game but as it sits right now I feel like I've got my $20 worth and then some!
1	 but damn if this game isn't what everyone wanted DayZ to be."
1	 great job and keep up the good work guys :)"
1	 crafting etc.) PLEASE FIX THIS."
1	good
1	 3 weeks without food is the way she goes devs."
1	 I enjoy this game."
-1	fix ure mechs
1	 this game is Great! is one big MIX bethewnArk/PUBG and more!  9/10"
1	 i pooped out a perfect green apple. Then my squadmate ate it.  I am now know as ""The Apple Giver"""
1	Best game. Only for me.. :D
1	good game ..... but i need a car
1	 got diarrea in middle of military"
1	.
-1	 it just goes to a menu with continue at the the bottom left and a close up of a back pack and  tent with a knife in the tree"
1	 meds etc.  This is Survival!!!"
1	Incredible game.The best of the best!
-1	 but I love a game that has smooth character control more. It honestly made me want to play Miscreated. If this game had character control similiar to miscreated it would be a solid 10/10."
1	 tried joining a bunch of servers (all of there were going from 0 people to full within second) and it was quite a fun expiriance. The only thing i would add is base building. Would make a lot better. So far 8/10"
1	 it was released less than 12 hours ago and the servers are gonna be iffy for the first few days. Anyone with a decent computer - you won't regret it."
1	 and the crafting has a nice depth to it."
1	 which the DEVs seem to be good at putting out regular patches to solve.SCUM's worth a try if you're into the genre."
1	10 out 10
1	Very good game
1	Having a blast playing this
-1	"It's Like DayZ (Standalone) & Miscreated had a baby and called it ""Scum"" before it had the chance to go to school and bullied for how deformed and mangled it looked."
1	 servers were stable for the majority of the evening and we've had great fun. Can't wait to see this game develop further!"
1	worth $20
1	 for the DayZ we deserve."
1	 thats pretty good!"
-1	 would not buy until then."
1	One of the best games on steam assuming your pc can handle it.
1	This gajm is really gut
1	 just waiting for the desync fixes like dayz in its beginnings"
1	 as you would in DayZ."
-1	 feeling confused......thinking is this it????"
-1	as it stands its a great game with alot of promise.......server with full pop everyone lags and teleports....medium pop not as bad unless u have russians on american servers.....low pop ez no teleporting games ok........WAIT UNTIL THEY FIX THE SERVERS [YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED]
1	 let others (preferably me) take it from your dead hands... :p"
1	 DayZ and H1Z1. Add to pot then simmer for 5 hours. Sip. Enjoy."
-1	"DON""T BUY YET !!!!!This scum  have sold their soul to g-portal.you are not allowed to host your own server and there is no coop....while it is under the game features on the steam store page .so if you want to play with friends now you need to rent an expensive server or otherwise you can get pvp't or you can loose all progress cause you played on a random server that can could be shut down cause the owner stopt its supscribtion...all other unreal engine based games like ark and conan give you the freedom to host your own game...... but the developer of scum thought they could get easy money through forcing us into subscribtions..shame because the game itself is actually pretty good and looks promising"
-1	 just not my thing."
1	 i would totally recommend this game if you like survival games and exploring"
1	the game does remind me of a better dayz. But i will say it will take a specific player and would suggest haveing a freind to play with in my opinion it is more enjoyable with a freind."
1	 you join in by paying with fame points. Other than that it's just you surviving alone or making camps with friends and enjoying your time in the world.Personally SCUM is what DayZ and Miscreated could have been if the devs actually put in effort to release the game. I stopped supporting Early Access for a few years because of the scam that was Miscreated but SCUM has brought me back in. Personally I think SCUM has a lot of potential and deserves the attention it's getting now. Ignore the mixed reviews and it give it a chance or come back in a few months time would be my recommendation."
1	This game is so good only been on pc for a few months but seen this when i first got pc and couldn't wait till it was out this game has so much more to give in terms of the game its self and new updates please keep up the good work love this game
1	 but it's working out great so far."
1	The best early access game i have ever encountered!Feels like a finished game already.Highly recommended for any survival games fan.
1	 if your looking for a superior version of dayz then u have found it!"
1	 for 20$ CDN it was worth it."
1	 not my business so I have no stakes in the company."
1	GREAT POTENTIAL in an early access game especially on start tend to be ridled with bugs with most unplayable untill a month or two after relase date however this game is not to bad but does need better optimization and much more content in the future
1	 you wont be disappointed."
1	I like it i been enjoying it just some optimization and polishing and its a great game honestly wait untill the game hype dies down some and come back in a month when the optimization and patches come out then you can be the judge of the game
1	 it is the first survival game I'm good at becuase it makes sense. Eating works more like real life than any game I've played. Had a blast playing solo and ran into a friendly and we ended up playing for about 7 hrs. Next day I played for 6 hours with 5 buddies and it was so much fun just surviving."
1	 the hyper-realistic aspect is all one could really be looking for in a survival game."
-1	 frustrating interface. No amount of updates will make this game fun."
1	gr8 game
1	and some other minor issues. Overall I do not think you will get as bored as you will in DayZ but this is more fun to play with freinds. Overall I would recommend buying this game while it is still in early access."
1	 so much more detail than other survivor games I've played. Tons of different loot and options. Visually it is great."
1	Great game with amazing graphics! I feel like there isn't as much loot as there should be but I'm sure that'll be tweaked. The core gameplay is solid & the game runs smoothly for the most part. I do get lag spikes whenever it loads parts of the world.
1	 a mag and some bullets>I tried to find the camper and thought I lost him>Heard explosive diarrhea coming from the closet near me>I go in and there he was>I let him finish and I put a bullet in his headhttps://imgur.com/a/Dce2b35 < gif so you can see i ain't lying"
1	 a few hours in SP mode will bring you up to speed and you will be fine. I'm holding out that this game turns out to become one for the history books."
-1	It's a good idea of a game but as it is at the time of this review it's too broken. If they fix the bugs and sort out the awful crafting system it might be ok. Yes I know it's early access but they are charging for it so it should be in a better state than it is.
-1	 laggy and obviously coded by a halfwit with a stutter."
1	 but it is just a cheap one that doesnt do much. The whole system with eating/heart rate and such is very unique giving you more of a survival feel that most games dont have. Majority of the crafting is obslete and certain crafting components don't work. Overall im giving this game a thumbs up as its only in the alpha stage and i can see real potential with the game. Hoping the major things they can fix is optimization and the servers."
1	Be me. Be me walking into a military camp. Be me picking up a shotgun. Be me finding a box of shotgun shells. Be me turning around to realize some 12 year old is mic spamming. Be me when I shoot him dead in the street. Be me chopping his body up. Be me realizing you can collect feet.  (Edit) Be me when 12 year old proceeds to tell everyone in the server where I am. Be me when I tell the server I have fresh feet for sale.                                       Im sold on this.                     10/10 -Me
-1	 the bugs and teleporting is too much of a draw back."
1	Add more food
1	Hunger Simulator 2018
1	Already better than DayZ. Well done keep up the good work. No complaints so far.
1	 or jobs-safe trading zones ? thinks thats gonna be a thing anyhow! SCUM=DAYZ KILLER!"
1	Its a hard game but if you learn how to play it then you will be amazed how good the game actually is.10/10 Game
1	Its very much like Dayz but much better with a single player option which is great. The game runs well on my W7 pc and this game has death match modes aswell as SP and MP survival and its at a good price. Nice job Devs !!
1	 but it's incredible already. I had a blast and it's all I can think about right now.10/10 - would eat shrooms till I puke again."
1	RIP DAY Z.
-1	 but main problem is: It's gonna end up like DayZ never finnished... and all that hype about this game will die because of boredom for waiting... or are we going for that alternative routine where it's gonna be just SCAM?"
1	 after that i puked on my poop and pee and i left the toilet completely ruined for the next Scumbag that comes along10/10"
1	a good time
1	 it is actually fun and interesting to survive together."
-1	NO SEA SERVER AND CANT PLAY 40 FPS AT MED SETTINGS
1	Newer updated dayz but its more realistic than emma watsons 0.1 inch tiddies
1	 you buy! show the devs some support and talk about what you like and dont like because these B E A Utiful bastards listen"
1	This is the game we all wanted to play back in 2012. Better late than never i guess.
1	SCUM is a good game and a nice twist on this genre. I have read a few comments about the game being bad and saying the loot impossible to find. In my experience loot is reasonably easy to come by. The only negatives I've come across are a few occasional bugs where you cant open doors or you will spawn in a slightly different place to where you logged off. Aside from that the man seems solid and might not have the best gunplay right now but it still feels decent. The game will go up from here and it's already better than dayz
1	 and enjoying it for what it is."
1	looking like being one of the greats you can tell the devs are passionate on delivering a game the world can enjoy. All the negative reviews are from brain dead gamers who dont realise this is an early access release so the game is obviously not finished and other content will be added. For an early access game im very impressed with the gameplay and the graphics i look forward to playing this game for the years to come. Our server is #1785 Europe if anybody would like to help me and my crew to populate it. thanks
1	Absolutely amazing! Well done to the devs! This game blows DayZ out of the water.... The devs are working really hard on this game! Buy it.... Give this dev team some cash.
1	Once the bugs are worked on and it crashes a lot less it's absolutely worth buying! so much in it especially for early access.
1	 i can play the multiplayer with my friends and when they leave i can finally play a singleplayer game on my own to get the hang of things and relax while killing a couple zombies with my axe 11/10 what i have always wanted from Dayz"
-1	 wait until they put some work into the game."
1	fun but mechs are insanley hard to get past but 10/10.
1	 I have really seen all sides of the game here and it is really fun and intense. I perfer to play with friends persoanally."
1	Garbage game with garbage people
1	This game is very fun with friends a lot of activities but i would like more weapons and animals to hunt.
-1	 apart from the speed being managed through the middle-wheel detail. There's a good amount of stamina so you don't bore yourself stopping all the time.I managed to find a deer which escaped when I got close. That's to be expected and worked well.Not much more I can say since I wish to refund this game before the 2-hour frame period."
1	Not to compare at all with dayz .... dayz is the real OG ( original game ) of this game genre.Don`t @ me
-1	I feel that I wasted my money on a dummy game how doesn't worth more than a few bucks but has a very good commercial advertise. I wouldn't recommend this game even if it was free.
1	 only if you can take the hardships of early access and want to actively participate in this game's development.stay safe!o7"
-1	Great game but the mechs are broken. They see you through all objects and kill you through them constantly. I really enjoy the game but this breaks it.
1	 its definetly a game changer."
1	 the dev team is surely working 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. Looking forward to more content thats been promised to come."
1	Great Zombie / Survival game. Yes the online servers are a little buggy at this stage but other than that the game is off to a great start. I love all the mechanics and commands you can give your prisoner. The looting isn't a problem at all and it won't take 1 day of looking for gear to PVP. The large War Robots in the militatry bases is an amazing twist to this genre of game. Definitely worth every cent.
-1	 what is the point in having it? Won't be playing until it's resolved.Screenshot available of the hackers name if the developers want it."
1	Great game but would be better if there was a reason to collect all the loot because after that it gets a bit dull and the map is a bit empty considering you spend 75% of the time running around but quite an entertaining game overall.
1	 and I want to congratulate them for their success."
1	 and the zombie jumped all over the wall and killed me. If you  could atlest reduse the Jump a bit so they atlest can't jump over bigger walls/ fences!"
-1	Quite boring right now
1	Everything Dayz wanted to be. Only scum is already there and dayz isn't even close.
1	Best thing ever happened to Early Access. 11/10
1	This is a much better version to DayZ. It has some really good suspense and pvp. The eating is really complicated but is actually pretty dang good when you figure it out.They added in anti-cheat so I'm changing the review. The devs so far have been proving that they really care about their game and the people that are playing it. They even changed the airport to make it much more difficult for people to get easy loot. Which I am happy to see since people have been trying to abuse it. Keep it up devs. Now the only other issue I need to be handled is the lagging issues on heavier servers. I had a moment where people were just teleporting everywhere and I couldn't defend myself as they beat me and shoot me dead. Pretty sure they were having a difficulty getting to me too but I don't know. They had an easier time getting me regardless.I guess the only thing I can also say on this game is that playing with other people would also be a plus. Be sure to bring your friends along and have a good time~
-1	is bad
1	Okay. I'm gonna give the game credit for not being a bad survival game even in the VERY OBVIOUS Early Access point it is in so I would reccomend it but the main problem I am having is even though I am running the reccomended requirements to run the game I am having plenty of problems with frame rate and lag even on low settings and in single player. I'm still going to give it a thumbs up for being very generous with the looting and bits of AI combat here and there compared to other survival games such as DayZ but I just would love to be able to not have so many issues running it in it's current condition.
1	visi nivo mraleeee
1	 but needs more content (obviously EA)"
1	 keep doing this and you'll be good."
1	 looking forward to see where this project is going!"
1	littt
1	 if you're on the bottom floor you can sometime see/pickup items from the floor above you10/10 Game so far."
1	very promising
1	 $19.99 is a great price for this innovative Survival game."
1	 so don't get it unless you understand what kind of barebones title you're getting."
-1	 the gameplay is super unbalanced but I do see what they are trying to achieve but hold off onto the game until they implement anti-cheat or better anti-cheat."
1	 but it need further updates on its optimizations."
-1	 however in it's current state the game is plagued by hackers with a lack of anti-cheat or banning/kick tools and a lack of features even for early access. Stay far away for a while and wait to see if these issues are fixed."
1	 it is probably better to spend it elsewhere as the early stages of this games development might frustrate you."
1	 so it is very promising."
1	:))
1	 maybe even the next Rust."
-1	 and there's tons of major bugs which should be sorted out before an alpha-release."
1	 DayZ is starting to have a much stronger contester. No doubt that after a year of development it could exceed DayZ as it's potential is powerful."
1	Good game
1	 it felt like I've barely started the game.THIS REVIEW MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE"
1	 but I'll trust them to repair it."
1	Lit game.
1	 and to launch with so little bugs is very impressive in this particular genre. Although it is similar to a few other games it shines as it's own thing! Best $20 on STEAM HANDS DOWN!"
1	Great game with a lot of potential. It's like walking dead meets hunger games.
1	Havent played too much yet but the game is great i would recommend it. It is really fun and not too hard but just right.
1	 by a long shot."
1	 but as I say it's an EA game."
1	 great concept. I really hope that the devs keep up with their promises because this game has a really great potential."
1	insane
-1	suck server
-1	 64 players and a looting system-After an hour or 2 you begin wondering what you have done in that space of time apart from go building to building searching for a weapon which you wont come across unless you go to the military base.i will change my opinions on this game in the future if the devs look towards fixing things but for now if you want to play something like DayZ and is actually populated ""for now"" do so. before this goes down the drain like DayZ did."
1	greats survival
1	 planning and patience."
-1	me no lik
1	This early access game is much like DayZ but the features are working. PVP is not very good atm but surviving in the woods and looting is really fun.
1	Don't buy it for PVP as dysnc is really bad but the survival aspect is good
1	 search for food and hope that there is an ammo in the box!Got used to the complex metabolism system after few hours.My fps is around 30 on gtx970m and i76700hq 24gbram with epic preset. On low preset 45+ but still under 50."
-1	people teleport around realism way to overrated in this game.
-1	 even a basic base building system. Refunded for now."
-1	Wouldn't recommend due to too early to enjoy as not enough things to do
-1	 bus simulator seems like much funnier than this. You dont do anything but in BS2018 you can pickup people and drive! These robots in the secret areas in scum just shoot you for no reason. Also hosting a server with 60 slots cost like 55 USD ! The loading screen looks like it have been painted with paint on windowsThank you"
1	Fun survival game.Good crafting system and nutrients system!Really enjoyable survival game akin to a more polished Dayz! Still got a ways to go but very fun
1	It good.
-1	 WARNING: DO NOT BUY"
1	 also it lacks many features but as i said its very young. Howewer its really fun to play with friends."
1	Didn't realize it was more than 6 hrs that I have been playing this game. Oops! how will I refund this. What am I saying this is a great game. I'm keeping it.
1	 10/10 would play walking sim again"
1	 and if they don't take too long for content updates it will be an amazing game. But please add an anti cheat in fast as everyone and their dog has some kind of hack at the moment."
1	 do that please! Fantastic experience playing this game even with fps drops and some lags. Game feels great and haven't played this kinda game since Dayz died. Fresh air in my fat belly. TY - BOOM!"
-1	btec dayz
-1	 who just want to survive and find some goodies.."
1	i think its a very good game to play with friends untill the servers get more populated but if i could ad one thing now it would be the ablity to cary dead bodies so you can get your loot if you have been shot by one of them scary robos i know you could or shouldnt be able to run full speed but it would be pretty nice also the ablity to see teammates on the map after adding them to squad. there is also a glich where if you sometimes drop items they go outside of the vacinity so you have to go hunting for them
1	 no graphic glitches no nothing  for all those who encounter low  FPS well just dont play  cool games like that on a gameboy :P"
-1	 Low fps plus lack of any real content besides running around and occasionally shooting makes this game too boring to leave a positive review."
1	 first of all i do have experience in survival games and i gotta say this game is better then average at the moment of developing. I had my first few hours now in Multiplayer and everything worked very well (minor lags but thats ok) .The understanding in how to craft and how to treat your health and food was a bit confusing but its understandable very quickly. I found some low tier rifles and many meele weapons what made it easy to not die instantly.  It is a young early acces title and you gotta treat it like that. I have some big hope in this game and i think it is a DayZ killer for sure. Lets wait and see what upcoming updates are going to bring into the game.Would recommend 5/7"
1	"Already better than the 5 year old early acces title ""DayZ""."
1	 good game."
1	 good game 10/10 but I do have to say that you need to add cars or something maybe a bike..?"
-1	boring after 10 minutes
1	 their isn't campain or a story mode that I know of but if you are going to play this game then I would recommend going online so you can team up with others and survive especially if you have a friend who would like to join your quest on surviving (add me if you'd like to form a team)"
1	 but I was willing to throw in the extra 10 for what might become the survival game I've been lookingfor for years."
1	One of the best survival games in every aspect.
-1	All the players are rubber banding and lagging
1	for a game that has just started early access you would not belive how good it is.graphics are good and fairly well optimised gameplay is solid no crashed to report so far I look forward to seeing this game develop
1	 and the most realistic pooping. 10/10 would poop out a banana and then eat it again."
1	I reviewed the game first day and I was wrong. I thought he robots were a terrible idea and too overpowered but once I put in more hours i believed they will be balanced once the bugs are fixed. This is a must play game if youre even somewhat interested. I have nearing 30 hours played since this review and cant put it down.
-1	The couple fights I've gotten in have been lag fests. And as I write this the broadcast they have up on the store page has a bambi lagging all over the streamers screen. So returning it and hopefully coming back later to a better game
1	beast
1	 I see no reason to believe they won't achieve greatness with SCUM."
1	 give us incentives to group up."
-1	Forget about trying to get a constant 60fps in this game. Wait for full release.
-1	 and fps optimization is higher."
1	 running off at the speed of light. 10/10"
1	 the game works better than dayz"
1	 but this game is promising. Hopefully there will be new features to come. Satisfied 8/10"
1	 support the devs they have made a decent stride making this into a seriously fun and hard game."
-1	 just another toxic KoS community. Not for those without extreme patience"
1	Hit a horse in the head with a large rock. Beat a zombie to death with a pitchfork for a dope track suit. Bled out after being shot by a giant robot. IGN 8/10
1	 you make your own character with it's own attributes such as intellegence and strength.I only currently have 4 hours on this game and think I got lucky with my spawn but I will keep playing as I am enjoying it a lot."
1	 hopefully other people are enjoying it as much as I am."
1	BEST SURVIVAL SIMULATOR EVER.
-1	FIX the bloody 21:9 resolution.....Whats the point of having wide screen moniters when your game won't fit!!!! games years old can do it ...why not you...I can't use the map or play in 3840/1024.....FIX It!!!!
1	 I can comfortably say this team has put together a game that has FAR exceeded my expectations and their quick response to bugs and issues with hackers gives me confidence that this is going to be a good ride for years to come. 5 out of 5 as far as I'm concerned. Just make sure you guys give us helicopters and support for HOTAS and TrackIR in the future."
1	A little buggy.
-1	 not optimized well at all. Also gets very boring quickly. refunded!"
1	 Ruth*"
1	This game features a bunch of inmates on an island... this game is Australia in the early days
1	 looting towns for cooking supplies and fighting off other survivors."
1	Nice game !
-1	 etc)- creation of your character it's a JOKE!! Another 'immersive' experience.- no fast transportation option - so ou have to run/walk all over the map like a brainless bot. I love it!- NO co-op mode against environment!!! No free PvE mode!- to rent a server you have to pay 19 euro per month! Which is pathetic greedy.Verdict: just refunded"
1	 and so much more! I recommend people to buy this game and support the developers through the early stages so they can update this game and make it a lot better then it is right now."
1	 we are going to be seeing great things come from them."
1	Game is amazingly fun and devs  deserve all best :)
1	Good survival game.
1	As of launch.. the game is amazing as far as gameplay goes. BUT the game is unoptimised and the servers are close to unplayable as all players you meet are teleporting back and forwards all over the place and you cant shoot anyone. i found 4 bullets and wasted all trying to shoot players that kept teleporting. idk game still needs work
1	I defacated a can or orange soda
1	 and has some cool features. the first guy i ran into though. just lagged around me and killed me. literally telporting 2-3 meters to the right or left."
-1	 AMAZING"
1	After playing 1.9 hours so far I feel like a lot more should be added. I was so hyped for this game and I wasn't let down I was just expecting a lot more. The map is really really huge! There's scarce supplies around the map even in towns. I know they are still working on SCUM and the DEVS still have my 110% support. I can't wait to see what they add! I do recommend this game but Buyer beware it's still in devolpment.
1	 stabbing and bodily functions"
1	better dayz
1	 this game runs pretty smooth already and has lots of game mechanics/logic implemented. It is only early access and in a better state than DayZ ever was! I'm keen on seing how it will fare through early access until release. It is up to the developers now to take care of the community feedback they should have plenty of."
1	 but 1000 times better."
1	Early access game with its own issues .. That said .. DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! The game has carzy simulations about everything .... when you run from a zombi and you have to stop because you  over eat and had on the spot diarea .... 10/10 game haha !  I really love the in depht simulation of this game here with very well done game mechanics ... while its still early it really has a solid foundation to start with .. in other words .. i love this game !
-1	 nothing to find. If youre hungry very difficult to find food except the occasional mushroom in the forest. Serched 8 houses and litterally found a fishing hat and a walnut. Needs big time buffs on drops."
1	 since not that much content is available yet.Pace yourself if you like this game. Don't make it your primary game just yet."
1	 Nice gameplay. Decided to Change my review after i put more hours into the game.. this game is amazing and i cant wait for them to update it more.. the only thing i dont like about this game is the Giant Mech Robots guarding all the loot.. seeing as thats all there is to do they are too hard to get by... maybe they need to be removed and more Puppets added in their place."
1	 looting etc. but you have to take a look for your own char too. not like ""food and water thats it"". no you gotta find the right type of food to get minerals and vitamins.so for me 10/10 very good game"
1	 this is Early access after all) if they peaked your interest then scoop it up !"
-1	 Wait until they make a game and then purchase it."
1	GREAT GAME NEXT PUBG WAIT NO ITS BETTER
1	 this is a reccomend for you."
1	 I am still support this game as it can play well than other games survival."
1	 and with some time and polish this title will be even more amazing than it already is. I feel this is already better than DayZ and its just come out. Only time will tell."
1	A good game for its price but there  are alot of bugs well it is early access so we should complain that much the devs are trying the best to  fix them and it fun with friends :D
-1	Waste of money.
1	The game is already better then most survival games and it just released. That says some things
1	 anti-cheat.TodayGot in to play despite crap fps because I enjoy the game nonethelessIn my absolute surprise (again) I get 40-60 fps (had constant 88 fps at some point). I had so much fun because I could PvP and PvE smoothly.A few points:I love the realistic physics. The moment a bullet hits a zombie's head it dies and falls on the ground. Stable servers make that possible.The devs listen to the community.Constant updates since release. Shows that devs are not lazy and I love them for that. They are giving their all into advancing this game to the next level.Not many crafting and building depth yet but they've already said that they're putting these in the future.Why I recommend this game in its CURRENT state:It's really fun and enjoyable as it is right now.To support the devs in order to make this game a masterpiece as it shows a lot of promise. They have my trust and they will have yours when you try this game out."
-1	 to make this review positive."
1	Good game!
1	The poop has more physics than DayZ and PUBG 10/10
1	 give the guys a chance to add more conent and fix bugs and optimize a little."
1	Better than Dayz
1	It's only been out for 6 hours and it already has more features than DayZ has in the past 6 years.
-1	just wait.
1	the res is screwd up for me what about you other wise its a good game
-1	 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1	Remove the mechs and replace them with AI maybe? or just nurf them so they dont one shot you and also detect you from dumb distances.
1	 but still better than DayZ and its only been out for less the a day."
-1	 and there is no purpose."
1	 oh man... EVERYTHING DayZ was supposed to be. Been fun pretending to be a Negan/Rambo combo. GREAT game. Solid buy especially for the price."
1	 and how no matter what I do I can't seem to keep my energy up."
1	Its great except the fighting is really laggy and glitchy with other players... needs to get a server search bar!!!
1	This game is Crazy good just played 7 hours straght ! ... But i have a Question is the Sodium bugged of is it just me my ingame player is dieing slow and i think its due to the sodium going up 5% every min ?
1	 I wouldn't recommend the game just yet.  It's first day of early access and they may add smaller maps or larger server populations.    Right now it's like Rust 2.0.  A combination of old Rust with the zombies and new Rust with the Mechs (instead of AI tanks) but without any base building.    I'll get my 20 bucks worth in easily but I think some expected the game to be something different."
1	only thing wrong with it is netcode like every other game
1	I killed a guy running towards me and he launched across the room          gg
-1	 repeat..."
1	 as well as other items in the inventory screen are used for ""crafing."""
1	 or feel you have to ask ""what do you do in this?"" or ""how do you win?"" this might not be for you and I'd advice waiting until more features are available before considering a purchase."
1	Definitely one of the better early access survival out there
1	 pick it up."
-1	Game doesnt make fun
1	 a great experience playing the game so far and I hope the Devs continue to work on it and perfect.Devs are doing a great job thanks for the awesome game."
1	imagine DayZ with loot...
-1	 where they couldn't ban you because you won't have a valid Steam ID.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
1	 a can opener and a pineapple. Not all at the same time... that would be crazy."
1	 I F****ING LOVE IT!!!!!!!!"
1	ChingChongKwayla.
1	Few hours in. Deff worth the $ and runds decent for very Alpha.
1	 Mist and maybe even Rust. I have a pretty old system and although I have most settings on low i'm still at 50+ fps in dense places and 60+ in open places which for me is playable. {Specs}~ CPU: I5 6600k~ RAM: 16GB DDR4 ~ GPU: Nvidea 970~ And a fairly basic motherboard and HDDEven with only 3 hours in the game I can strongly recommend this game and urge you to buy it before it goes up in price like Ark did."
1	Play it :)
-1	Love the feature where the game runs after you close it and you end up logging 45 hours and cant return it... 13/11 would eat beans again
1	great innovative mechanics
-1	SUCKS DONT BUY
-1	 another EA game let down!"
1	Pretty awesome game for an early access
1	good game it only has alot of server lag and needs buffing on the smoothness of the graphics so it runs better. further 10/10
1	Not bad
1	a true survival game.
1	 but there is also a lot of survival aspects you can do on your own in the woods. The map is quite large so don't expect to see anyone unless you go to a military base."
-1	 it still makes  it laggy. On the other hand it is a very good game its just the lag."
-1	-respawn randomly for free or cheaper atleast-increase server slots-insta kill from a robot shouldnt be possible
1	 najboljih 16 $ koje sam dao"
-1	 my mid range to slightly below midrange computer could not handle the game even at the lowest settings. Take my review with a grain of salt as I only managed to experience the game for less than 2 hours of stuttery gameplay. I can not recommend this game if you don't have a beefy computer or unless you are sure your rigg can handle it."
1	 not its current state"
1	Like DayZ with better devs.
1	..... This will be a great game eventually....Please don't let us down Dev's........"
1	 hopfully the ad that in the future"
1	 not a PVP only game."
1	an apple come out my butt no lie thats a 10/10 for me lol its EA so theres gunna be little bugs here and there but to be fair DEVS are on top of there game i just hope they keep up the good work . zombies are insane if they hear one shot with your gun bang 10 15 zombies come chasing you if you are on your own you are DEAD FACT and the robots god damm it just hide like a pro shhhhhh he's looking this way dont move BOB you can do it f#k in hell BOB why did you move BOB'S dead people well done BOB
-1	 this is my opinion thus far and I really hope they can prove me wrong in the near future."
-1	lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag  that all i need and make the game easier
1	 further optimization.  I'm running the game on an i7 6700k with a 1080ti @ 1440p epic and getting 60fps."
1	its good but you need to fix bugs..especially during the shooting and running sometimes
-1	Dayz running simulator 2.0. Dont waste your money
1	Dayz killer!! great game. i love it
-1	Devs think frying your CPU & GPU is a good thing. Buy this game if you want to cook an egg on your processor.
1	 and killed waves of zombies neither of those compare to the complete brutality of surviving the elements. All this being said i think scum has GREAT POTENTIAL and is definetely  going in the right direction. PS. it also seems like the DEVs really want this game to be good and have been working very hard into getting this game stable and closer to 1.0"
-1	 and if you look llike crap with a hangover you don't get on tv and say hey we're early release..."
-1	30 hours in GOODBeautiful game The basic mechanics of pve are great Vaulting and movement are good Looting is easy and intuitive BADPvp desync is horrible - every fight at range or not is a slideshow (this unfixed will be the reson for the biggest drop in players ) Once you have looted/geared up you want fights - but this is consistently the worse deysync ive seen in a game
1	 I am very much looking forward to what is in store for the future of SCUM."
1	 they listen and change things as needed and each patch is adding a tonne of new things that are great for the game!"
1	I bought the game in  advanced because it has some serious potential
1	 and it's great. It's better than i expected :d (Still needs improvement though...)"
1	Best Survival Game so far
1	 is what makes this game great  even with its minor faults."
1	Best surival game since DayZ was introduced. Keep up the great work guys!
1	 I'd pick it up so you can learn the game before more stuff is added. And It's only $20. So it Isn't expensive. Although who knows if that'll change."
1	 when vehicles are added to the game it will make travesing the map much quicker. I'd say scum is worth picking up as the price is going to increase as more content is added. Playing solo can be fun but with a friend is much better like with most games."
1	Bought the game and relized the game was to powerful for me so instead im building a new 1k dollar PC just to play this game on high settings thats how good this game is
1	 because it is pointless playing it as it is."
1	 I cant wait to see how it evolves forward."
1	 this is great so far. To see great detail in this game already is fantastic. They have amazing lighting and graphics although hopefully they can improve fps on lower end pc. I was amazed when I found a horse and how beatiful she appreared in the open fields. Cannot wait to tame the horses because it was kind of sad to shoot the horse then beat it to death. Overall there are some great moment and if they polish the game It will be unforgettable experience. The idea of farming crops and vehicles will add to the drama of surviving. Hopefully they can add some even more intelligent ai. I rate this game 8 out of 10 so far only because it is early access. 10 out of 10 if they polish the game with possibly differewnt map sizes. Some people may like smaller maps to get into the action a lot faster rather than roaming and looting all the time. Personally I like this map size but have friends that would differ."
-1	Crappy game for crappy kids
1	 some glitches. Map is huge and running sim 2.0 but enjoy it for what it is while it changes."
1	 if you hate it get a refund."
1	 this early access game is absolutely worth the price and I am very excited to watch how it becomes better and better."
-1	 the game had me intrigued"
1	 buuuut i know the game is early access so the game neeed optimization.. 20 fps is not cool even on low hp (yes i have good pc)"
1	  and more content has come."
1	 or dehydrate as soon as you log in. You are able to travel and not worry to much as there is a good amount of resources to use around you."
1	I ve accidentally change the resolution and cannot come back. any help?
-1	 6$ in CIS Region. This game has a lot of potential. Let's see in a ~year..."
1	 but you need a good pc to paly it!"
-1	 I really love the whole bio stats and making sure you get vitamins etc but the fact 6 hours in I still can't even shoot a weapon is utterly ridiculous. Fed up now already. I'm out."
-1	 there's basically no purpose to this game as is. Don't let the gimicky pooping and peeing catch your attention or all the fancy readings of your players metabolsim or health stats. Behind it all there really is nothing to do."
1	Please add controller support!!!
1	I pooped on a dead guy. 10/10 would poop on a dead guy again.
-1	Worst game I've ever played. i'd have more fun circumcising myself with a rusty nail.
1	 had some very interesting interactions so far and I haven't played for very long. Been enjoing myself so far."
1	Game looks nice but you canot play whit GTX750 25 fps ..
1	Tried to stab a dude with a bit of stone. Got stabbed instead. 10/10
1	 deer runs away with the spear in its head>mfw left with no spear12/10"
1	i like the game. tobad im only going guarded places cuz thats the only good spot. towns need a little more loot tbh
1	HELLO!
-1	 my first hour of the game is amazing."
-1	 espcially this piece of scum"
-1	terrible optimization. 30fps ...
-1	 but the delivery was poor."
-1	 you're just like the others developers."
1	 I'm sure they will fix it.You got PVP & Solo (pve) options.P.S! after you kill another player you can squat down and take a HOT steaming sh*t in their mouth!"
-1	Too much lag
1	my dream game with single player peace.. Rip dayz..
1	SCUUUUUM GAAAAANG
1	 this is what DayZ should have been 5 years ago. Amazing so far."
-1	not worth it servers not working want a refund
1	 found a cauliflower. Game completed. Didn't expect it to be over so soon!"
1	 and there is a big issue with hackers... once they get rid of the hackers the game will be great though"
-1	It's pubg with practically no guns.  Item managment is grueling even without the horribly limited inventory (duct tape doesn't stack!). A big boring copy & paste landscape with no vehicles. No content. This is a DayZ scam.
1	 you do it uncontrolably.  Its so realistic but still fun"
1	Great Game! One of the better early access games that i've played. A lot of content and good fun with the mates!You can already do a lot in the game and the roadmap looks promising. To say the least you can entertain yourself for hours by just pooping on your friends while they're passed out from some poisonous mushroom or alcohol.PS: They get sick and die so poop with caution!11/10 TOP!!
-1	We need Some loot and rip fps
-1	I hope I can buy cool emotes with my fame points when the full game launches *dab*
-1	Waiting for refund
1	 so far it isn't that hard to gear up and have some fun."
1	 but because you care.Thank you."
1	 10/10"
1	 but I don't expect this to be a finished product. From what they brought to the table already this is amazing. Already a more polished and fluid experience compared to any other game in its Genre. I can't wait to see what else gets released and how events unfold."

1	 Croteam! I do believe you're sitting on a potential gold mine here!"
-1	horrible game dont buy it
-1	 don't get me wrong. This game has a lot of potential which sadly isn't there yet. I'm looking forward to the game in the future and I hope for some more feedback that lets you know 'why' you died."
1	 this is by far one of the best survival games out there with heaps of potential. Despite being very early in development.  it currently shows that the developers are not a bunch of headless idiots trying to make a quick buck. They are straight players like us and understand the mechanics of survival games properly."
-1	i can not recommend this game at this time until they anti cheat i had high hopes for this but a hacker teleported to me and killed me as soon as i found ammo https://clips.twitch.tv/AgitatedPatientPieCeilingCat
1	So far this has been a great game. I despise survival games that get perverted into PVP only bullcrap (Cough DayZ cough H1Z1)! There is a single player mode that I've been playing and enjoying very much. This game has a lot of potential!
1	 just like DayZ but better and more complicated."
1	 and very fast loading times."
-1	 PvE / Single player doesnt make sense.No dedicated Server Files availible. Only Hoster is price-gauging atm.Not recommended."
1	 and blow the robot up. 10/10 still playing."
1	 this games for you!"
1	 even stock pile a few sets in containers by your shelter you think you've hidden like a pro. Too e z"
1	"walked down the road to find abandoned buildings with my buddy. Out of curiosity we checked them out and found some water. My friend yells at me that he got wacked by a shovel and so i run to him and i call out for the guy. The guy proceeds to act friendly with me and says he just hit a guy with a shovel but the guy ran away. I say ""oh we'll find him"" I go near the water fountain and act like im drinking and the guy pulls out his shovel to come and wack me. Too bad i was ready pull ouut my pitchfork and my friend jumps him from behind. we won that fight and ate his body. 10/10 would cannabilize again"
1	This game has so much potential. Really happy with buying it. Looking forward to more engine & content updates! Good job devs :)
1	 mostly because there were gsync issues but last night I did a couple of events and didn't have any issues.  Looking forward to more!"
1	 a quick youtube will verify your doubts if you have them. Good try though devs."
1	 it would be cool to see bases and to raid them :DThanks from Vrbovec :D"
1	 pooped on body for bringing shame on famiry.10/10 would buy again"
1	how i wanted dayz/the devs to be. more content coming and there has been like 3 patches this week which shows how hard the guys behind the scenes are really working! i reccomend u buy it now before full release and this game cost's alot more.
1	"
1	 it's really hard to attack anything just like real life xD"
1	7/10 now9/10 in twelve months time
1	fun fun fun
1	 this is a awesome game . Keep up the good work ."
1	Killed some ZombiesAte their meatWasnt hungry anymore10 out of 10 would totaly early access again!
1	This is what Dayz should have been but was so far from.Have fun
-1	No item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was foundNo item was found
1	 but i like.Great item of fun and play.I can has dlc?-Birch Swamp"
1	No complaints here for a great EA game for $20
1	 worth your money and support."
1	its bassically a PVE game since the map is so big and the servers only hold 64 people but its ok....
1	 and arma you will enjoy this very much! Cheers.."
1	Legit got in met up with my friend killed a donkey with spears and ate its head.10/10 Would recommend!
1	 and the culling had a baby this would be it! XD poeple are upset the servers are crashing and giving the game a bad review when all you need to do is exit steam restart and update. thats why the servers are crashing LOL."
1	Amazing gameplay great start. The devs are well in with the community and are making a solid effort to smooth the game out for us. Cant wait to see what happens with this game down the line
1	 but It will be a really good game once it grows."
1	best donkey chasing simulator ive played. 10/10
1	 this game came out few hours ago. Already has more features."
1	 because it was only $20 and this game has a lot of development ahead which I'm excited to be apart of. EVery EA has bugs stope winging and crying people this is expected."
1	 i love it"
-1	game cant even launch ....
1	 but it only going to get better."
-1	 the game is nearly unplayable."
1	I have played a bit of this game since it's release as early access by far one of the best early access games I have played. I can see this game being super great. There isn't much right now but the devs are quite quick.
1	I bought this game to play with my brother. He keeps bailing on me to go play Escape from Tarkov with his long distance friend. I've been stuck playing solo since I bought it but I can see the potential if you have friends to play it with.
1	its sik
1	 general survival and crafting mechanics are amazing. And the best part is that its only in early access! Can't wait to see what else this game has in store for us in the future. If you had hope for Dayz and other games in the genre but are just generally disapotied  in the options out there then this is the game for you. This is what every survival game should have been from the start. Best $20 I have ever spend on a video game."
-1	 wait a lil bit cuz this game needs content and more players per server"
1	Playing SCUM with friends.Six of us vs 1 zombie. First friend pulls out shotgun and misses and kills other friend.First friend cant handle the pain and commits sucide.His head explodes like a grape getting squished.10/10 Would play again.
1	es muy bueno beaners
1	First of all i got to say this game is looking to be the best survival game ever made in my opinion.Graphics are GreatSounds Are Very GoodIt runs ok but needs some with towns ectThe loot is very well doneThe only to things atm that REALLY need fixing is the D Sync as it makes PVP Awful and team members need to be marked on your map so you dont get lost easyOther than that fantastic work! keep it up Guys.
1	Awsome game
-1	needs a lot of work.
1	My Dayz replacement ? Its looking like it...
1	 it can get infinitely more enjoyable. Have made some incredible memorable moments in this game."
1	GOTY 2018
-1	 save it; because the average player will come away frustrated or board out of their minds."
1	Good change of pace from other survivals
-1	 then i'll try it again. It has SO much potential!"
1	dayz but you can poop and fight metal gears
-1	refund after 50minutes
-1	oke i live in croati game whount connact me to server thats good game is based in croatia but it thosent whont to connact playrs from croatia to server its my internet probably but i traid to connact to 10 server it thosent whont to and all of tham are eur plz help me or fix the games if the game is a problem i dont recommand the game intil is ficst sori for bad englis
1	10/10 game for the price..... if you liked the arma dayz mod or dayz SA - you will love this..its light years ahead of standalone and its everything day z standalone should have been. Devs have been great they have pushed  4 patches since launch  (writing this on day 2)
1	 Do you want to get in now or want to jump in once the pool is full w/ scum?"
-1	Walking Simulator
1	 little trouble getting into servers sometime tho."
1	 needs more time in the oven. Will re-buy it on full release."
1	game is a really good with a huge potentional but net code is garbage
1	 and i can run the game at a high quality however i choose not to because id prefer performance in a game like this. A lot of people are paranoid because streamers hyped it up and people assume its going to be perfect on day one but i can assure you that if you join the right server it will be a great experience. Take a gander at this day one gameplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-W5e3EFrBk"
1	Not bad.
1	 CtF and other events you can partake in to mix things up. If you enjoy a challenge and are open to something a little different but like hyper realistic games it's well worth the 20 dollar EA intro price."
1	Currently still boring but it looks like it will develop into something nice .
1	Got to pee on my friend as he was drinking from a stream 10/10
-1	 yeah its realistic but a game is supposed to be fun and unpredictable...."
1	 you can also poo on zombies."
-1	 SCUM is nothing special.. YET!"
1	 but the random encounters you experience with your squad/friends is going to make this game worthwhile."
1	 damn bush sounds are working. He appears startled and looks at my bush. Lucky I'm trained in the art of camouflage and he doesn't notice me. When he finally thinks its safe I leap out of the bushes spear already cocked and loaded and shout ""UGANDAN SUPA SOLJA"" and throw with the accuracy of an olympian. Bam.. the guy never had a chance. 10/10"
1	I have been waiting ages for the DayZ Killer to arrive! MUAHAHA 10/10 for an early access game!
1	It's not the game that made me give this a positive review. It's not the fun aspect of looting and surviving. It's not the good graphics and excellent mapsize and map quality.It's the devs. The devs are helpful and love the player base
1	fun game but I would love to see them taking a look at server stabillity next to the (cheater problem) As it is now it is almost impossible to get a good shot on someone unless they stand still or you spray them down with an auto rifle.Other then that it is fun to play and cant wait to see the new stuff in the game.Would I recommend this game yea but obviously it is early acces and people should remember this when buying it !
1	 could easily see it become a 10/10 here soon."
-1	 definitely skip it if you don't like solo play with abominable lag every time you're not the only person on screen."
1	 and it's only gonna get better from here as the Devs seem to be very involved in the community and pump out frequent updates and patch notes."
1	le faltaria solo servidores en latino america porfavor es horrible jugar con mucho ping y optimizarlo un poco mas ya que da lagazos y se tilda aveces
1	 Resolution & Fullscreen Fix  ...see the comments."
-1	Don't buy this game in its current state :Terrible FPSCombat is some of the worst I've seenMechs one shot
1	 there's definitely worse.. I'm sure (hoping) the developers will continue to improve it and implement a lot more stuff in the near future and I'll enjoy the ride.. if I don't get too frustrated being shot through walls that is !"
-1	dont recomend for low end pc users it runs horribly 10-20 fps on lowest graphics needs to be better optimized
1	this game is incredible and should be the number one game
1	yes
1	This is a great game! and I bought it right when it came out. I was expecting tons of bugs but it runned very well for early access im very excited to see where this game goes in the future !
1	 expect some bugs. praying in a couple months they get it all finished up"
1	Target engaged simulator
1	This game reminds me old times I had with Arma 2 DayZ mod. 10/10
1	 but right now... it ends up being a bit boring."
1	 Keep move on I like it <3"
1	 still needs more content but the setup is great"
-1	DayZ 2. Meh.
1	7.2/10 Interesting game. Well optimized. Cool world to run around in. I made a video on how to play it on your Android devices if your interested. https://youtu.be/HZJk9OJJovQ
1	 and they still have a bunch of stuff not added in yet. I like this type of game and im excited to see where it goes from here. So far so good."
1	its not pooping if there's no poop.
1	The DayZ We've all wanted.
1	10/10
1	 improves by every update"
1	 so..........."
1	Brilliant .
-1	Game doesnt match the hypesimple simplestop making me run 2 hours to see my friendsonly to break my ankle and overdose on painkillers
1	high potential
-1	Remove the robots and the game will be much better :)
1	 I got nothing but love for you.  Thanks for the game."
-1	"This ""game"" came out to early. This is early access of Early Access.Refunded."
-1	Just not for me
-1	not worth the money in it's current state
1	Great game!The only thing that is really crappy is the stuttering when encounter another player. Can't even fire a shot and I am dead...really frustrating. Please fix the server optimization.
1	 and PvP/PvE than DayZ"
1	 if there was a 1 min - 5 min delay depending on the amount of respawns on a squadmate in a certain amount of time this would not be a problem. This would make combat better when you dont have to constanty kill the same guy who keeps spawning to his squadmate who is camping behind a rock.-Comming from playing csgo for a few yeas the game feels a bit stiff to play but this is something i can get used to.-I dont know if a thing like this will work in the game but removing the sentries from the large military bases would turn them into high intensity combat areas where there is an even larger risk reward ration than right now with the sentries. If you manage to kill a player who has been there for some time and killed many people and looted he will drop large amounts of high tier loot. Staying longer means more better loot but a higher chance of bein killed in the process. Maybe this could be achieved with out removing the sentries im not sure but i think this has some potential.These few issues dont make me give this game a bad review but it keeps me from giving it 10/10 either. The core gameplay is great and with a few tweaks here and there this game will be a huge hit in the survival community"
1	Brilliant. Just brilliant!
1	Best Game Ever
-1	Very bad game just dont buy it like i did you will never play this and just waste your money.This game is boring and pointless and there is nothing intresting about this.Buy something else instead.Anything is better than this.You just waste your hard drive space.Advertising is deceiving and game is far from complete.Arma3 Exile is the best survival crafting simulation out there where you can actually build a base and barter for items vehicles even helicopters.... and it will be always be the best.
-1	Just shot some dude 5 times with an AK then punched him maybe 20 times and then he threw a spear and axe at me then punched me to death. The game is trash. If your gonna get it make sure you shoot someone with your entire clip and never engage in a boxing match.
-1	I was very fun for my friends but this game wasn't for me sorry couldn't recommended i couldn't find a way to make it fun.
1	I can manage my metabolism and my food intake way better in this game than in real life10/10
1	This game is everything i asked for an more!! Completely trumps DayZ!
1	 improving on a daily basis."
1	 cant wait for more content and future updates. Great work devs."
-1	 medicine does not work...i do not think you would stop to vomit and get killed if you are chased by a herd of zombies... the list continues..."
-1	 end game or goal wont be happening prolly."
1	 you can do this is Scum but it's very limited.)If some of these things would be added it would make for a much better game."
-1	its fun but its very dodgy spawns are annoying and it takes forever to sprint
-1	 not even food that you need to survive... Not giving it another hour."
1	 carbs and the like. Has a singleplayer for a good learning experience. I dig it. Definitely worth the price."
1	10/10
1	Vey cool and fun survival game. Strongly reccomend
1	 coming to this realization we grouped up and i headed us back to our main groups meeting point where the rest of our team was our group now 23 strong we took over the airport and setup a new home inside one of the hangers.After many days at our hanger compound collecting loot from the airfield and it's underground base we found multiple grenades rocket launchers and set out to kill one of these mechs through trial an error we worked out how to do it an started clearing the airfield of mechs word got out that we were not to be f**ked with an that the airfield was now a safe haven for all.We lived gloriously for the rest of our lives  10/10 would do it all again.GAME IS F**KING AWESOME BUY ITIt's what Day Z should of been it's what Miscreated tries to be it's what H1Z1 couldn't fathom to be it is what the War Z aka Infestation Z dreams of it's the new top dog of survival game's."
1	 ive had dears run away with 2 spears in their head"
1	 that's impressive."
1	If you love survival games and have a one friend this is for you!
1	 the recent update literally 110% improved the server sync in one update. Huge props to devs for actually working hard on the game to improve it unlike some other early access games."
1	 and a patch was released that fixed the server issues and optimized game"
1	Devs are working hard and so far the game is like no other in many ways! Good game!
1	Every aspect of this game I had a problem with on my initial impression was solved by learning how to use in game mechanics. Everything is well thought out it's amazing. 10/10 worth the long wait. Good job!
1	lit af
1	 even with lack of content."
1	 how many of u had a Game with this price and in Early Access that made so much fun?If u like DayZ but wished to be way harder and Complex.. here is your game"
1	 fun.."
-1	 making melee almost impossible. So far going in alone seems like a huge disadvantage. Not my cup of tea."
1	 eventually you will defecate noting but olives."
-1	 and often there is a delay packet loss. The game experience is very poor."
1	8/10 Survival and RPG elements together to make a great game
1	 it makes me want to learn from my mistakes and get better. I cant wait to see where this goes."
1	 hop in and have fun."
1	 and the devs seem to have a grasp on what the game SHOULD be. Can't wait for more content."
-1	 which is nearly essential to a literal S U R V I V A L game. How is running around and dying over and over survival."
1	 and there have been daily patches. Has the makings to be the best survival sim yet!!"
1	 and a small proportion is actually PVP.So yeah overall a solid game but in need of improvements. Worth picking up and giving it a go and just keepinng up to date on the game patches."
1	 this game is spectacular. It looks beautiful on ANY graphics preset and runs well at recommended specs. This is a game you can really get immersed in."
1	SCUM + + + + + +Battlegrounds - - -Fortnite - -
1	 the events are fun and the crafting was done very good!"
1	 but as of now I can say this is a vey enjoyable game for people who like games like DayZ & Miscreated"
-1	 but I'm sure they will figure it out and then I can recommend the game for softcore survival."
1	 leading me to believe this game has a GREAT structure and I'[m super interested to see where it goes."
1	 betray him by impalement with a thrown spear. you can also poop yourself to death"
1	A continuation of previous best in genre games such as H1Z1 and DayZvast amounts of mechanics designed to add realism have increased the depth far past any other survival game on the marketif the roadmap is completed SCUM will be the zombie survival genre king
1	 i wish the devs well and i wish them a good outcome for this game"
1	000 dollars with pretty much high end specs yet i get 30 fps outside and 40 inside yet I have over recomended specs for your pc and it runs like that so hopefully they make performence improvments but yeah it's weird i don't like running games at 30 fps with turned down settings"
1	This is a great game!
1	 loot management is easier. Even on a low end video card the game runs smoothly and looks decent. This game has alot of promise and is half the price of Dayz"
-1	 wasted my money.0/10 - fyuck you."
1	calorie counting..and of course pooping and peeing"
1	 and there will obviously be more planned.-I ate a poisonous mushroom once and forced my character to vomit."
1	better dayz
1	 better Dayz and its an EA"
1	Requires Harverd Graduation to under stand the game
1	 watch some gameplay videos and figure for yourself if its worth buying.So far the game for myself is a 8/10. It's better than Dayz and cheaper to."
1	lovely visuals & cool weapon handling imoand the devs are pretty fast at doing what the community needs/wantsso keeping in mind what early access developers did back then it should be addressed how decent the devs are handling this situation currently"
-1	Absolute trashRefunded
1	Really fun I would suggest checking it out. Looking foward to see how it develops.
1	Very happy with this game and shout out to the devs for doing a fantastic job and keepin up with community
1	 not to mention the Devs are staying in communication with the players. I'm excited for whats to come."
1	 very impressive given its early access. Plenty of playability in its current state and definitely looking forward to seeing how this one grows/improves with time."
1	you can kill a bear and put its head in your pink school bag 11/10
1	IS GOOD YES MUCH WORK TO BE DONE BUT ALOT OF POTENTIAL
1	 would refund again."
1	 needs to be cleaned and polished and only then will it shine!"
1	Its fun until a Mech with eyes on his back kills you in an instant and you have to restart and die because of a mech again or in a fight because of DESYNC
1	 if you have friends then buy"
-1	Nope nope nope.
1	Basically Dayz ..  but better.  12.5/10
1	 when you play single player you dont get any story why you just spawn in the middle of the forest and zombies are way over powered in my opinion. Also it would be cool if there was like AI colonies in single player where you can make friends and create your own town and get attacked or attack other colonies. Overall if the developers keeep updating the game and putting their hardest effort the game can get huge."
1	Buy it
-1	IT WAS SO EMPTY
1	Unlike DayZ I can atually put backpacks in my backpack. 10/10
1	 long time."
1	Decapitated a human and proceeded to make sausages out of human flesh. 8/8
1	Great game hands down.
1	 or just want's a very challenging and fun survival game to play."
1	 I recommend you to look up some beginner-guides on youtube."
1	I love this game.. :)
1	 server issues. Besides that this game has a lot of potential and I enjoy playing it."
1	So far I love it. Its definitely challenging to get used to all the controls and maintaining proper nutrition but it's fun. The mechs at the military outposts really make you work for the good loot. I think the people complaining about the mechs on the comments and reviews are just mad because the game isnt easy. Cant wait to see what they do with the game in the coming months. So far it's one of my favorite games
1	 killing is either too easy or it's ""o hai im hack0rz ur ded""-MOAR animals please! (wiiiith invincible Witcher-style kitties if it's not too much trouble pls :)"
1	Would really like some more events or set a goal to the game so it does not get bored after a long day of playing."
1	 that IMO was a flaw on a game like H1Z1 where it was pretty much abandoned after PUBG came out."
1	 16gb of ram. i get a solid 50+fps with med to high settings. (beforeopitmaztions)Going to be playing this game only pretty much."
1	 see how you feel after 1 1/2 hours and refund it if no likey . After 1 1/2 hours you should have a good idea as to whether you want to keep it or not"
1	 but 2-3 patches with bugfixes coming out everyday i can see it will not stay in alpha for 5 years lol. WP devs (L)"
1	 there is anything I can do? I really want to play this game."
-1	Dayz clone but worse.
1	 and a fair few peformance issues with larger buildings and the UI is somewhat confusing(Basically the metabolism page and crafting) and tutorials would be nice. My rating would be 7/10"
1	 but right from the beggining you are able to get the materials to craft throwing spears which can one hit zombies.For the price this game is being sold... its very very much worth it!"
-1	Arent there enough dayZ clones out there?
1	 it's amazing and already way ahead of Dayz. Definitely worth it. Cant wait to see what this game will become once it's fully released."
1	 in depth survival systemsa lot of potential in this one."
1	 character proceeded to collaspe on the ground for 30 minutes cause hes a lightweight."
1	 etc etc) but it does eat through your fame points quite a bit.. Great game! Friends and I are enjoying it greatly!"
1	i love
-1	 if you like that you will love this game."
-1	 but you'd then find 22 ammo and an AK magazine."
1	i just love walking and looting.
1	Most realistic poops in any video game ever. 10/10 would poop again!
-1	This game is great and has alot of potential..But in its current state I cannot recomend it because the performance is awful and it barely if at all lets you into multiplayer servers and if by a miracle you do connect their is a chance the game will just crash. I know i only have 59 mins in this game but 40 of those 59 mins was  me trying to connect to a server  with my friends so unless you have a god tier computer I suggest waiting a few months for the devs to improve the opdimize the game  before you spend your money on it
-1	 shame it's just as broken as any other EA."
1	 but its the second day and what do you expect for a game that just came out."
1	 ect."
1	I love the game so far i only have one issue at the moment is i logged out of my server and when i logged back in I was falling through the world and i can't do anything which sucks because i had just looted a military base.
1	 this game has been out not even 30 hours from this review so give it a month max it will be more accessible for people that dont own insane computers i mean i have a RX 560 and it runs okay but crashes a lot so i say if you want to buy it to play straight away i would be honest with yourself and think if you could run it."
-1	The game as an idea is very good. However having spent nearly an hour trying to get started due to a lack of walkthrough tutorials on how the basics work and the constant glitches and crashes I had enough. Only to be told by steam I could not claim a refund as I had gone over the 2 Hours gameplay they deem is sufficient to be able to see if its a game you like. It is a game I would probably enjoy but it has way to many glitches and should be pulled by either steam or the developer until they have it sorted! Very disappointed in both companies with the lack of support.
1	Better then DayZ.
1	 but I can feel the love put into this game and I have complete faith it will only get better and better! Well worth the money already and I am excited to see where this game goes!"
1	i like this very much. looking forward to future updates
-1	at  the moment i would not recommend this game as I spent 2.7 hours getting gear to die to a player that i shot 20 bullets into but apearently he killed me with an axe because of the lag.
1	day 1: amazing graphic. gameplay is great. worth !
1	I said to myself i would not buy another alpha game but here i am playing a dayz
-1	 but the multiplayer is too expensive for just 2-3 people. I will redo my review when dedicated servers are out. :)"
1	amzing
1	 however it helps the development of the game. Thanks :)"
1	 keep it up. :)"
1	 we went about our business. Then I realized I had pooped out an MP5 magazine. Best survival experience of my life. Thanks for being available in Alpha!"
1	 but its all worth it when u start getting into shoot outs. my only problem i have with the game is server issues and a severe memory leak issue that has yet to be resolved developers have been working around the clock and have been putting out patches almost eveyday since launch so i can live with it for now.so far this game is extremely worth it for the $20 price tag and it is one of the best survival games i have played to date!"
1	Really enjoyed the game so far. well worth the money.
1	10/10.... got into a hostage situation with 3 others at the policestation a friend of mine with a draganov shot through the second floor window headshotting the armed attacker taking us hostage i was then able to pick up his gun and gun down his two friends... the only game where you dont ever want to die XD
1	bad but good
-1	Give the character wipes a rest ffs. no need for them at all.... grow up
1	Good game for the early access they care abut the game they allmost update the game everyday!!
1	When I first bought SCUM i questioned it extremely!  The servers were terrible i could never hit anyone.  But they have fixed the server stability very well so far. Its been a lot better since launch and i do reccomend it.  They have been releasing a lot of updates to fix many issues.  I still hate how overpowered the mechs are but i hope that will change in time. But for now i highly reccomend if you enjoy a more hardcore survival game with more than just looting and then killing!
1	One of the best survaival game 2018.
1	6 patches in 8 days. This game is gonna become very good. It's already fun but they are gonna add like a ton of more content.
1	Strangly this is not a new game ! may be a remake or remode But after a 30 mins i was like wait a min i played this game before when entering the bunkers and airport But you needed a really top end pc back then to play not many had so maybe why not noticed. and was many years agoStill a good game for the price to many overpriced poop games these days
1	So to get started I would say by far this is one of the most indeph and promising survival games that I have played. The graphics are suberb but more importantly the mechanics of the game are very good now and show promise for a whole new level of survival game there are some issues such as disconnects but those seem to be minimal for me at least and I had a issue with the anti cheat not letting me launch the game once but a simple verify of the files fixed that. Besides that the enemy's are so far ok the mechs are a nice change of pace for a game were evasion is your best option instead of just killing everything. Besides that if you enjoy a good survival game that is pretty unforgiving to say the least than you should buy it while its at a low price. Keep in mind though that this game is still in development and will probaly have many ups and downs before its released.
1	 i give it a 8.5/10 with the only cons being lag/lack of conent. Once this game has finally reached its end state I will undoubtedly drop a solid 10/10."
-1	 but I wouldn't recommend as yet."
1	 it has it's faults like:-Optimiztion problems-Bugs-Character creator is not that good (for now)-Walking( A LOT)But they are going to add so many things and it's pretty good in it's current state!The survival game I had the most fun with and the most realistic game that I've played!"
1	 crafting is lacking. But I think it is a great start for a game that can only get better with enough attention to it.I certainly look forward to seeing what they make of this one!"
-1	 more like SCAM!"
-1	 the higher pop servers are unplayable right now due to players teleporting. I'm sure theyll get this figured out sooner or later. Netcode is absolutely trash in its current state."
1	It needs alot of work but it can and will be a masterpeice!"
1	 good game concept."
1	SCUM has a great foundation. The devs are extremely responsive and quick to add updates/fixes. If you are a fan of exploration and survival games I believe SCUM is a great choice.
-1	this game is really boring but has alot of potential
-1	do i recommend this game?not yet
1	 has it's problems like any other early access game. im sure they'll stick with it because the game has a lot of potential. Hoping to see some sort of base building or base fortifying so i can work towards somethin to and hide my goodies in! But for now even with it having ""no content"" i find it extremely enjoyable therefore it must mean good things to come. Countin on ya Scum !"
1	 I died... Still better than DayZ"
-1	 refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
-1	 run!  and run and run and run and run"
1	Cool survival gameIts real boizzz !
-1	This game is scum.
1	 but the devs communicate well and are constantly adding new content and fixing issues. 8/10"
1	Better than DayZ already.
1	 keep it up!"
1	 and bushes)Hopefully from here on out the game can only get better!!!"
-1	Ok.. so i play'd this game few hours and i crashed like 100 times while i was trying to play and got on a server crashed and could not get back on that server cus it was full and i ended up playing on like 10 servers starting over again and again untill it annoyed me so mutch i uninstalled.Loot respawn is to slow so you join a server and everything is already looted.
1	Everything about the core mechanics is solid. Two patches in a week and the devs are hard at work to bring vehicles and base building. I havent been so engulfed in a game and so excited for the next updates.
1	 special people writing harsh reviews on a discounted recently released EA game. I'm really sorry 20 bucks wrecked your ****."
1	 AND it's in early access. 10/10 Probably the best game i have played to this date."
1	 just bad lag for now."
1	I skuanch this game
1	After few years i finally enjoy in game
1	Give it a chance. It's what DayZ should have been.
1	 once you fire a gun there is a good chance you are gonna get killed by 20 zombies rushing to sound I hope game keeps getting some updates and i would really like to see  more optoin when you are building like u have in rust"
-1	Its really... really bad.
1	 but i am enjoying the game."
1	 farming and such.... GG LIFE"
-1	I Played 2 hours of this game and all i have done is die loot and run i have never seen a player it is one of the most boring game ever DONT BUY IT A WASTE OF MONEY
1	 lets hope it doesnt become dayz."
1	It's like Arma 2 DayZ and Tarkov had a baby.
1	having a blast on this game.  Definitely what DayZ should have been in terms of smoothness and gameplay.
1	 my 1060 runs the game at a 60fps smooth on ultra. Most reviews are idiots with single core laptops."
1	 if u just kill any animal u can carry its food cause its a 1x1 + u get 30+ pieces of meat that will last u WEEKS (not a joke btw) u need to just understand the game."
1	Amazing game! Hardcore survival! LOVE IT!
-1	 literally."
1	 people who are saying its bad launched the game and was instantly butthurt about the learning curve... this game is the future of the survival genre."
-1	 then buy 20 copies of it. It will still be a better investment than buying this piece of trash."
1	 but only time will tell."
1	Pooped a pineapple out that saved me from starvation. 10/10
-1	So after around 6 Hours of streaming the new game Scum I went for a refund on it. The game is lacking so much as a survival game and well its nothing more than a running simulator. I give it a 4/10 they still have a lot of work to do to make that worthy of playing. You can see my full stream here -> https://www.twitch.tv/videos/303454254
-1	 and also to tedious"
1	 but that's what i've experienced 3 hours in."
1	 I did not understand what this game had to offer."
1	I had fairly high hopes for the game.  After the first hour of playing I thought I was playing DayZ.  Mind you a DayZ that actually works.  IMHO the graphics look better in DayZ.  There isn't much seperating the two.  Maybe the Mechs and robot that shows up once and a while.
-1	 but unless your purely buying to support the devs there is literally no enjoyment in this game currently."
1	 maybe wait a few days and see how they're handled."
1	 I would have recommended this game if it were $49.99 and I can also confidently say that based on this games content on it's first day of public release? I can't even imagine what these dev's have planned for the future and I would highly recommend getting this game as soon as you can because it's only $19.99 and over time will increase in price based on the content it releases and the more content there is to play.I would get it now at it's cheapest price. But if it came down to it I would have paid $59.99...Good job dev's!"
1	Far better than any EA release. And by EA I mean Electronic Arts.
-1	 drink stuff and eat makes the game feel like a chugging bore.  Couldn't get into the game as much as I would have liked to and I found the overall gameplay to be monotonous and boring.Don't like what I had to say?  Then I welcome you to email me your thoughts about the game at DON'TPLAYHTHISGAME@GMAIL.COM"
-1	not worth it now !"
1	 shooting and not having no end game other than just killing other people after you get looted up the game is boring if youre playing by yourself but you can always mess around with friends. Also the aiming is really hard to adjust to and they should make the guns look less cartoony if u can understand that + how tf does a KAR98 not able to have a scope on it u would think that would be a given"
-1	 taking down 5 fully geard guys with one pistol... GG this game needs major help....oh did i mention there is no way to report hackers?if you take away anything from this review please wait till they implement ANY sort of anticheat and/or a report system"
1	 but enjoyable."
1	 like many others write a bad review which it doesn't deserve."
1	 it is worth the money for now. If you are looking a fully functioning game and would rather wait for the official release you will be paying more money down the road. I bought it knowing that I will be playing it on and off because of the early access aspect."
1	1.)please fix the camp and storage boxes. its always missing eventhough the logo is still there. (fix)2.)recently there are to many wall hacker on scum. its ridiculos to get shot thru the wall when u are standing still without making any movement.
1	poop sim but good
-1	 only for me to rubberband around a wall and all of the shots having missed.In its current state I can not recomend this game due to how broken the PVP feels and how often that becomes an issue."
1	"Unsure why the reviews for this are ""Mixed"" this is an excellent purchase for $19.99 and what an early access game should be."
-1	 but as of currently I am giving this game a Negative on its review. Its still far too unplayable."
1	 the mechanics are stunning and the game in itself is a wonder to behold"
-1	 this game needs one. Shouldnt have to watch youtube videos to figure out how to do basic things."
-1	3yrstooearly
-1	 with even less guns. Refunded. The end."
1	 HAS SOME BUGS AND IS IN NEED OF OPTOMIZATION IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT IT HAS TONS OF POTENTIAL TO BE SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SURVIVAL GAME. AT THE MOMENT IT IS VERY FUN DEFINITELY WORTH THE BUY. BEST $20 GAME ON STEAM!"
1	 took crowbar.and then I pooped on him.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150298528010/10"
1	 i love how detailed are some features and this is one of those games you can lose yourself 4-5 hours exploring and not even feel it. this is something i really like"
-1	Going for a refund. I'll come back if they deploy PVE Coop.
1	 but it's a good one bois. Better than DayZ and has a better edge with the setting of it. Don't add pets/taming/base building (fortifying will be dope). I'm all game for the development of this right now."
1	THEY LET YOU S@#$ ON YOUR FRIENDS 10/75.  Very cool game overall seriously.
-1	get rid of the zombies or i wont play this gamethe zombies in this game is too op they took a whole mag to kill or u need to land a headshot but when they are chasing u there is no way u can get a headshot and when there is 20 chasing u ur die stop tryingzombies in scum = tank in l4d2
1	 lol."
1	if you dont have over 5000% fiber you dont know what youre doingedit: daily updates are cool too
1	gERBAGE
-1	garbage
1	 and all my 3 hours of looting went missing & didnt load back in. RIP. Should I go back?"
1	Good for an early access survival game. Worth it is penny. Beware the drone that comes to kill you.
1	 but it is playable most times."
1	 sometimes you run into really cool people sometimes you run into a squad of 15 wanting blood... sometimes you run into a psycho that killed 20+ people alone and butchered their bodies in one room... (the 15 people in that server ended up losing that fight) All in all though its really fun with friends and in my opinion the DayZ we should've had! Pick it up if you get some friends that are willing to try it!"
1	 or it's another restart. Remember this is early access and the whole point of playing it is to give feedback and improve what is already a Champion of a game. Great depth of information and stats. Good on you dev. team. Keep up the great work!"
1	 and bugs."
1	 this is not it.  This feels like it can be THE survival game a lot of us have been looking for."
1	 physics and survival mechanics are very solid out of the gate."
1	The most fun ive ever had in an early acces game:)
1	 can't wait to see what comes."
1	 and now all that's left to fix is the net code on very populated servers as some people will jump around when looking at them. On med-low servers everything else is fine. I'm very pleased with how this game launched and how fluid it is. Keep up the good work devs!Overall I've had a excellent experience and people seem to love to hate EA games on launch judging by the negative reviews."
1	 I would reccomend this game 100%."
1	Day one more content than dayz after 5 years.....and already more updates.......XDthis will be a big thing when its finished .
-1	Its a good game and all but when you pvp or run you lag really bad and my stamina goes down so fast theres so many bugs and servers are broken dont play this game until they fix it.
1	 zombies can hear it from 100 meters away..."
1	 you'll find yourself with a great gaming experince."
1	 good game"
1	Play with friends and you'll have fun.
1	 and acts swiftly on their changes/updates.Greatest. Survival Game. Ever."
1	 then i ate a watermelon and died 10/10 will play again. I also pooped on my friend!"
1	I love the game but the teleporting players need be fixed and most of all the memoery leak breaking my heart i will look forward to seeing what you do with the game.
1	Fun game with a high learning curve.
-1	 performance. In short: It runs like dog turd. I have turned all settings to minimum at 50% render resolution and its still difficult to break 40fps with my GTX 1080. After a few minutes this drops to 15fps.I will gladly change my review to recommended once the performance issues are fixed.I really want to play more but can't with this performance.I recommend waiting a week or two and hopefully they'll fix these issues."
-1	 and they're here to stay."
1	 which hopefully are solved soon."
-1	 let's just hope it doesn't have to sit as long as DayZ..."
1	"This game is realistic and is really fun to enjoy to just make the best decision between being killed or not.Obviously it a early acces game so server and game optimazation is definitely required to get good framerates and nice fights Character movement is on point and funny.Car and plane features that i saw at the beginning are definitely a must because the map is huge.Graphics and optimazation is alot better then pubg now is in the 1.0 update lol.The food system needs to be simplified because i totally not understand it so i wait till he screames ""i am hungry!"".After all this was totally worth the money i spend on this game and i hope the developers will continue too support this game!I think this game would be very good when it gets out of the earlly acces and has better optimazation and features"
1	Ignore the negative reviews which are almost all about the servers being slammed. The game is fun already and is only going to keep getting better.
1	 and is a whole lot of fun with multiple friends.Rating: Currently - 9/10 Potential 1000/10.-"
-1	 until then....negative review stays."
1	 although it may be better if sprinting was still on shift with the shift-scroll to adjust speeds as needed. The only weapon I was able to find in over an hour was a spade. I couldn't even find a tree limb to use as a club or for crafting. Overall I have to say I like the inovative features in this and I hope they use EA to continue to polish and work on this."
-1	 it legit is running simulator."
1	 it will get better and get fixes. So far FOR AN EARLY ACCESS game its pretty good and has alot of potential. Don't throw this game off just cause of some inpatient angry toxic steam users."
-1	 what the hell were you thinking about?)I don't recommend this game right now. See you in 2 months with 20**!"
1	love the game so much but i beg that the devs optimise the game more
1	 chopped its body to pieces and pooped on top of its head! 10/10"
1	 like wtf.Anyway. Yeh get this game :)"
1	DayZ in good. <3
1	nice
1	Walked into a supermarket and there was food.Already better than DayZ10/10 ign
1	So far so good
1	it is something different than i have played till now ! :) irecomend it !"
-1	Would be great game if it worked :)
1	 and that's about it. The game is pretty solid."
1	SURE BEATS THE HELL OUTTA DAYZ 20 YEARS IN ALPHA!
1	I enjoyed the game but there is no Arabic language
1	yeet
-1	 but for now I am refunding."
-1	 Refunded."
1	 survive."
1	Died to sodium 3 times in 4 hours top notch game
1	the new and improved DayZ :)
-1	 everything is too spaced out and you always find poor quality loot to not even make it worthwhile.So far this game isn't worth it as other mods / games do a better job of what this game is doing."
1	Typical EA response. The game is pretty sick. There are defnitely some things that need to be reworked or implemented.  But overall this is very addicting.
-1	 just a bit realistic."
1	"Best ""zombie survival"" game to date. The way this game plays with excellent gfx from a unknown dev is awesome. Leaps and bounds above any other game in the genre. Hopefully like with all EA game the devs keep updating and keep listening to the commmunity.  Completely worth the $20 usd."
-1	The game looks really nice and has a lot of potential. The big problem is that there currently is no anti-cheat system and cheaters are already appearing in the game. I'm refunding but may re-buy it when either the cheating is fixed or there is a decent PvE game option.
1	 you won't regret it!!!"
1	 only you can be dumb."
1	 ngl."
1	 but I personally don't want to play it until they do something about the robots. They're so stupid and just make the game pointless because they one shot you and you can't escape them or anything."
-1	Everythings great except all the hackers teleporting to you and killing you for your gear.
-1	Overwhelmingly average in all respects.
-1	 but nothing that cant be fixed."
1	Starving.Finds watermelon in store.Starts vomiting because of overeating.Gets shot in the head while vomiting.10/10
1	 it's still a pretty good game. I can't wait to see where it is in 6-months from now because what's currently here shows a ton of potential."
1	Pretty much dayz not broken and more loot
1	 Rust and other survival games you will absolutely love this game. DO. NOT. LISTEN. TO. THE. REVIEWS. seriously!this game is amazing!"
-1	The multiplayer is literally unplayable as other players warp around continuously making any meaningful PvP experience impossible.
1	this game is amazing its a game that u can enjoy with friends and have a laugh it looks beautiful runs well even if u have a mid range pc dont listen to the stupid reviews on here that are negative they are players that got gear died and lost it and got salty with about 1 hour play time the devs are amazing if it needs fixing they fix it straight away not wait for days this will be my main game for a long time to come and it will only get better with every update  well done devs for an amazing game
1	Game delievers an exellent platform atm to become the best hardcore survival game out there. Still alot of things missing but the atmosphere and gameplay are already great. Really curious how it will evolve :)
1	Less than a week into EA and it's 10x the game DayZ Standalone is after almost 5 years. Great job. Really fun game. Looking forward to the updates.
1	 much better than DayZ etc. It feels almost like a complete game just some things needed to be added and it'll feel amazing! (Only problems are lowish fps unless you adjust your nvidia settings and also some server stability issues depending on the amount of players on the server) Besides that I highly recommend! 8/10"
-1	MEH
-1	(2HOURS PLAYED)Me and my friends was playing on an official sever. When we all died at the same time by a hacker!! I was really looking forward to this game. But i feel like it's like dayz...Not alot of loot and loads of hackers :(hopefully the devz will keep upgrading the game and making it better :)Then maybe i will purchase the game agen in the near future :)
-1	 this game has a LONG way to go."
-1	I do not recomend the game in its current state it has a hacker problem
1	 OFC it has bugs and itsnt perfect like there is a glitch where after a hour or so of playing FPS will go terrible but that dosnt stop me from playing a all around good survial game :)NO ITS NOT A BATTLE ROYAL FFS"
1	 i wish when you die your food would refill but dont listen to these bad reviews its a great game for people into this sort of gameplay"
1	 its dayz after 6 years on its first day."
1	Like dayz? Then 100% recommend. Really not bad for early access (besides the low fps) but has alot of potential.
1	 Im impressed of what have been achieved so far in Early access. Very stable so far. *Notes for the Devs: Keep in mind that the diversity of items is very low and the amount of loot  you can find in the world is very very scarse. I recommend improving that part as it makes the gamelpay tedious in that aspect. Looking forward to play SCUM for many years!"
-1	 etc etc.  Devs need to address this issue with players jumping around. Watch any youtube video on this game to see what I mean. Kind of amazing to me they released it like this. Early access or not. Isn't fighting one another the point of SCUM?"
1	 even in these early stages!"
1	Scum > DayZGive it 1 year and it will be a really good survival Game.
-1	Garbage m8
1	Great game!
1	i hope u fixed it"
1	Very realistic and in a very good way in my opinion.  Love the realism to the survival aspect and the overall game play.
1	OMG just love the game.
-1	 and instant kill robots. Day-Z fans will love the game. People not experienced with this kind of game might want to wait for a sale or the game to receive a few more updates before purchasing which is why I have to give the game an overall no."
1	I like it
-1	 Im done. Refunded. 1/10 trash jogging sim.[DayZ fanboy defense systems: ONLINE]"
1	 here comes a zombie> kill zombie with rock but take damage>find 2 litres of lime soda>drink 2 litres of lime soda and die from blood loss10/10"
-1	boring after ten minutes... running simulator.....
1	Absolutely love this game already. great content for early access and ive found very few issues which in time I know will be fixed. Definitely reccommend playing this.
-1	 SCUM"
-1	This game is actually dumb. Dev's must be autistic
1	Very good game :) I got one tapped trough a wall by a robot.
1	 Its worth its price. I have not yet seen a bug in this game which is really great for early access game because in early access we all do expect bugs and all that but not yet have seen one. Yeah thats all... Just buy the dam game."
1	SCUM is the best bathroom simulator currently on the market
-1	Broken game...EZ REFUND
1	 once vechicles are intoduced i feel like the game will be a lot better since you wont need to spend half of the playtime running around. Get the game now before the price gets jacked up because the game has a lot of potential.  :3"
1	ESC--- Commit Suicide Best feature instead of trying to kill yourself.10/10
1	 has lots and lots of potential for the devs to work on. Teaming up with friends could be easier otherwise 10/10 running simulator <3"
1	 and yes i would recommend this game to everyone i know.----PS CRREAM TOLD ME TO PUT THE GAME AS POSITIVE"
1	 scum is lifeThis Game Is Great! Better W/ Friends!Can't wait for features to come to the game. Driving would be super niceThere is a lot of running around. So if you don't like that. Do not get this game. But For Me 9/10 Till It gets full release. Add Me If Ya Wanna Play!"
1	 recommend playing with friends.Game start might be a bit rough but once you get some inventory space you'll have a lot more fun.Hunting animals is intuitive.Stealth mechanics in military camps are fun and tense."
1	 SCUM is a fascinating concept that I am bound to spend hundreds of hours playing when it has been polished to a AAA shine by the devs."
1	 looking forward to the updates!  Will update review after more play time."
1	fun
1	great game. NEEDS ALOT OF OPTIMAZATION THO
1	 I am not too worried. Once again committed devs. That being said Scum is probably one of the better buys on Steam for the price it's asking for. The quality of gameplay you will recieve for the price is fantastic. And it can only get better from here..."
1	 making the game more stablea and squashing bugs!!!want to see more game mechanics implemented soon. keep up the good work!!!"
-1	 but currently its a no for me."
-1	 Horrible server performance when in combat (teleporting players)TLDR; A rubberbanding walk simulator"
1	 very good"
-1	 then I log off and loot next time.Old review (release day)- Can't find friends in server- Can't search for specific server- Can't order server list"
-1	 You knew this game was gonna be top seller don't lie. Fix the servers ASAP PLEASE."
1	Still a good game runs way better now then it did the week of release the developers are nice people and listen to the community this game is living up to what I expected to be.
1	very nice
-1	 not other players.- Better instructions/information when hovering over stats/items etc.  I have no idea what effect that thing I just ate has on my body even though there are sooo  many numbers and information displayed.- Better Crafting Interface: Make it clear which items are missing and which are not or why you can't craft a certain item.- Field Of View Slider: Oh my god this is so important. First Person feels like a nightmare atm.- More scopes/attachments for weapons.- Bigger variety in buildings/interiors. Also add more safes or stuff like that in some random buildings where we can find some useful stuff. So that you're not forced to visit military areas.- Compass- Decrease the VoIP range and/or add volume dampening when the other person is behind a wall.- Add more sounds/better sounds for various tasks. Some of the animal sounds are super weird. And the robot move sound sounds like a baby crying."
1	 being an owner of Dayz from the start this game comes face to face with it but knocked Dayz out simply because the Zombies are more optimized than a game that's been in development for 10 year! Hope to see this game progress into something wonderful and do everything others said they would do but couldn't deliver! on a side note I'm running the game on a dinosaur of a computer at the moment (not main rig) rocking 15- 20 fps on a GTX 460 lol. I was surprised it ran!"
1	Need more optimization
-1	Roses are redViolets are blueYou can poop in this gameGraphics looks like poop too!
1	 people are having a hard time connecting to severs and some can't even play the game. The server browser doesn't have a filter at this point. (Remember it is still in early access) Besides the very few issues with the initial launch of this game I do recommend purchasing and playing this game. It looks amazing and all the hype about this game probably being to advanced is not true. I find it exetremely easy to stay on top of taking care of my player.Take into consideration that the FPS in this game is F***ing S**t right now. If im on Epic Graphics Quality (20fps)If im on Low Graphics Quality (20fps)...so wtf am i supposed to do?"
-1	 probably has less glitches!"
-1	Meh
1	Promising so far. The display works fine at 2560x1080  on my R9 280X. I will look at the RAM usage next time I play but it was running smoothly in the single player mode. Fast and hard Zombies took 1/2 my health to beat one down. The gear from the dead Z then drops on the floor so I got some better looking clothes. (With less storage!)Keep up the good work DEV's and when I can get the server files I will start my own SCUM World PVE Server. Hopefully released sooner than Dayz's (Still waiting 3 years on........) Have fun SCUMMERS and avoid them Z's they hurt!
-1	 everyone buy insurgency sandstorm instead much better game in its beta stage. also i think that the new rocket league update that came out the same time and day was more of a success and has won me over than this pile of fungus that has been stepped on by the fat Scarce because no one likes the skinny one. over all i think that everyone who thinks this is a good game should be exiled to bloody hell bye and suck it JoshP ""this sh*t game rather play Dayz""*drops mic*"
1	 I fell in love with this game."
-1	Very fun game.. but at this moment the optimization is bad. fps drops when entering houses and fighting. will remove my thumbsdown when this is fixed
-1	 well for now for sure. Just wasting my money."
1	Absolute golden game. Like dayz but nothing like it as everything works! Strongly recommended to my fellow survivors
-1	It's a laggy game....
-1	Way too many bugs
1	What DayZ should have been. Still buggy but yeah it's early access.
-1	 but a survival game needs more than that to last."
1	 there wouldn't be all the players just concentrated around the airfield)"
-1	it says 8gb ram needed.  it use 6.2 gb ram on high graphic setting and on low settings exactly the same ram which is trange cause a ultra low graphic settings should save allot ram but the change of settings dont cause any change in ram usage which is totally strange. my system need like 1.8 gb ram like every normal system so this game brings 8 gb ram to the edge and laggs the crap out of my pc .i would rly like to play it but its very frustating if you get killed in pvp cause of a 5 seconds hardware lagg spike :/ .......... twice ... i hope they fix the performance soon but as long as its that bad i cant give it a thumb up :(
1	second me is inside here :D
1	 and prairies I've seen in a video game. The twist of mechs guarding the best loot is fabulous. For only $20 it is a steal!"
1	Very nice
1	 I'm glad to say that this game has launched in a better state than DayZ and with a lot more features as well. I look forward for whats to come!"
1	 highly recommended!"
-1	boring game.  I tried getting into this game but it wasnt what i was hopeing for. I hoped we could also build structures ingame but that isnt going to be a option.  I tried to get a refund but i coundt since i cant go over 2 hours of game play.  the game looks good but its just boring to me.  Maybe it will get some updates to make it more fun.
-1	 go outside and walk if you like to walk."
-1	 hope it gets better down the line"
1	This game is great. Hands down to the developers. Only thing that i dont like is brightness during the night. It's very dark and almost impossible to see.
1	"One of the better survival games out there.But still pretty ""Early Access"" but fun."
1	 better than dayz"
1	Finally a survivor game done right and it's still beta.
1	 a baton and a pump action shotty. Animations and general feel lends itself more to PUBG than Day Z. Your char can leap through windows and vault fences. All actions are smooth and instantaneous. Inventory is inutuive and easy to manipulate. First encounter with zeds. Bohemia's effort is. Scum borrows much from Day Z but takes it to the next level. Environments are more interactive  and the game has a next gen feel. Its early Days for Scum but this is the definitve leader of the MMO Survival genre."
1	Good times
1	Scum picks up where Day Z left off.   It takes the game to a new level of survival with the crafting system and the over all heath and stats of your player..  Keep in mind this is the early access so don't expect a polished game but I am happy with what I see.  The inventory system is idential to Day Z but the game is expanded with the crafting system which I am still learning.   This game actually has zombies in it and they can be difficult to kill.  You also have the threat of other players which makes the game challenging.  I have no experienced any memory leaks or issues with lag that some people complain about.  The game runs fine..
1	 used its hide to make a bag.Got one inch super punched by a bear (ragdoll physics FTW).Found a nice hooded jumper in a hut.Got attacked by a zombie (WTF - didn't realise there were zombies).Found ED 209 off of RoboCop but unfortunately for me he didn't want to be friends.Then I decided to give online play a go.  I got into the first official server I tried (which I think is where a lot of people are having issues) and set about looting a farm house.  This lead to a spade vs axe fight with a fellow looter which I lost.  I respawned and found a military bunker! Managed to sneak past ED 209 and tool up properly but the sneaky robot bastard was waiting for me when I came out.  This game is definitely worth checking out if you're to survival/PvP/battle royale type games.  Its sort of a decent mix of RUST and DayZ.Final thought.  I searched a small pile of rocks for some rocks.  No rocks were found."
-1	basically a rip off of dayz... in other words dont bother... id say alot of streamers were sponsored to play it even though most of them stated its wasnt sponsored
1	Good
1	this game is really promising. I'm finding difficulty in joining my friends who are currently playing in SCUM official server #1556.i kept refreshing the server list but #1556 just won't show up to me at all for some reasons.Please fix this!
1	Amazing platform for a great survival game. Great graphics and very immersive. Probably the most polished early access I've played. The devs are super active and releasing patches daily.
1	you  can poop on the ground
1	For a new alpha game this game is really smooth.Im sure it will be better in near future.You really need to play this game if you like survival games.
1	Watch it rising to the top along PUBG and Fortnite.
1	 where people don't kill on sight everyone they see."
1	 and its goooooone.... + Still better than RL - RIP Fps  - Needs a Toilet Paper in the game - My grandmother runs better than this game"
1	there is a guy that keeps stalking me and my pals with a black suit and flashlight XDDDD its scary af. Fun for all accept for squeekers
1	10/10. Greatest $20 I have ever spent.
1	 thanks for this wonderful game"
-1	 on your own terms."
-1	 but I play most games on high if not Max. This game runs the same on all settings. It's just horribly optimized"
1	 the core mechanics are reasonably solid.. and looting and exploring is fun."
1	 all the while cutting off their heads and pooping in their mouths. I can't wait to see where they take this game in the future."
1	 perfectly normal for an early access game."
1	BIG Support for Croatia teams :) Game is looking great and has a potential to become legendary!
1	fun game
1	really good!
-1	needs alot of work
1	 also is you're buying go to the airport at B1 and B2 and watch out for the mechs but the loot is insane there"
1	 not a DLC! Quite Like a much better DayZ.Please support the devs to fix Desync and hackers. Try to grab some friends as it is fun with them too!"
1	I'm really enjoying this game. You expect a few bugs and issues at the start as its early access.
-1	 unoptimised and has cheaters. Wait on this one and see if it improves."
1	 you can poop off a dam."
1	 repeat. I was on the ropes about this from the get go but gave it a try. Didnt really care for it but if you liked dayz and want a slightly different twist on it then give SCUM a try."
-1	fun but gets frustrating very fast the crafting system is not good needs lots of work.  you collect everything you need to male an item and then for some reason it will not make said item if there is another reason for this it would be nice if it told you why.
-1	The worst game i've ever played.
1	 buy it if you want to support a good survival game."
-1	 60 fps +. But it keeps freezing for ~1 secondes every ~30 secondes."
-1	 what future.  Where is it? When will it come? How often will purchasers of this bundle get and what can be expected.Don't give them your money!"
1	 Puppets which are like Zombies to kill and few other surprises. This game is definitely going to exelent when it is finished and i can not wate for more features to be added.Things i would like see added to this game.Drivable Vehicles would be big help al the map is rather large.More Guns would be good too.Maybe some beds in some of the buildings where you can sleep and also respawn from if you die.All in all this is a good game at the moment for being in early access and i have high hopes for SCUM as it shows a lot of potential."
-1	 one of the worst games i've played. it's buggy in every aspect & full of cheaters. even the net code is so bad that PvP is a slideshow. 0/10"
1	 I really enjoy it. Hope it will get completed asap"
1	 other game run perfectly fine on my potato pc but not this game lol"
-1	bad boring cant find anyone to big map dont buy
-1	 because it doesnt have any vehicles yet. Bought it because it has potential."
1	 but i think devlover can fix it. i hope that"
1	Fantastic Landscapes.Pls fix stuttering <3
1	Great game as of so far. Occasional crashes but this is expected as its still early in the works. Can't wait to see more content added to make this game even better.
1	v
-1	Fix The god damn Resolution Glitch
-1	Downloaded the game but could never launch the main menu would never load. Overall disappointed but will monitor for patches. Requesting a refund in the meantime.
1	 but i get it that the controls are to complex. Good work devs!!!"
1	 so tired of politics in games"
-1	Runs very bad and overall boring. GTX 1070 7700k 16GB Ram
-1	Early Access for sure! The game it self is ok in some ways but the servers are horrible. The map is huge so with the low caps of players makes it impossible to have fun. It's like running around and around and around and around. Not impressed at all.
1	 this game is STELLAR.Cheers"
-1	I do recommend buying the game cause it does have a lot of potential but i do not recommend playing it at the moment unless you like dying to glitches :)
1	Character depth and customisation feels good. Hopefully this game will expand further.Survival learning cuvre is steep and the ui could do with some work overall.Negatives are this game feels poorly optimised and some shocking fps when appraoching built up areasps.  add some form of transport very soon"
1	 pleanty of things to do and not too glitchy for a early access. Although there are some unnecessary complex mechanics that don't need to exist like a lot of the metabolism information."
1	I like it!
1	Very intersting game and very good optimised !!!Thumbs up for you Also checkout my yt chanel and my twich acc when i livestream almost evrydayYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9IYYH_mxX2TLLZ2AkDfzYQ/featured?disable_polymer=true My youtube chanel where i will be posting 1 to 3 videos evry week-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/1ramzezz1 I stream once or twice a week so follow me-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	 though it is hard to run!"
1	Really cool game. I truely hope they're able to sort out the netcode between players. I see the $20 bucks as an investment & am recommending on that basis.
1	 while you learn the map and where to find certain types of loot.Overall this game is great so far but does need work. Ill update this review as best i can as patches are made."
1	The game has great potential!
-1	 making it painfully long to reach anything useful."
1	 hunting system is working really well too. And the Mechs (robot) are getting fix soon in patches. For 20$ jump in and enjoy before price rise up. ***"
1	This is what i do i sh%t on you
1	The Best Survival PVE/PVP game at this time !!!! To be in ur library no problem.THx to have made this game...... :o)
1	 I wish dayz much luck .. but not sure I can keep waiting when we have scum"
1	 but I genuinely believe even in its current state that it's a better game than DayZ is even after five years in development."
-1	wait a while I would say to myself a day or two ago.if I knew what I Know right about. now."
1	 $20 is a fair price for what content the devs have pushed out up until this point and a good investment for a game that will most likely get even better and rise in price."
1	A ''dayz'' game where you actually can find tons of weapons and gear without running 2000 miles!fun parkour although right now they do have server issues
1	I had been looting for a good amount of time and had pretty good gear. Then I met two germans who seemed friendly at first. One of them asked me how to open a conserve and then the other guy shot me in the face. Now my sole purpose is to avenge my death. 10/10 would die to a unfriendly german again.
1	 the discord has a bunch of fireteam channels to group up with other players and help get a quick start. the metabolism system is a great mechanic; for those without any idea on proper nutritional dieting for your own health this is a great way to learn as you play. THIS IS EVERYTHING DAYZ COULD HAVE BEEN AND MORE. LOVE IT!!!!!!"
1	 oWo Croatia"
1	Awsome for a EA can't wait for the furture content.
1	Have u heard about Jesus??well this game is created by him because its amazing.
1	Great game! It just came out and already better than DayZ in many aspects
1	the only survival game that i was brave enough to try... and i don't feel sorry about it. now addicted to it. great to play with friends but also alone.
1	I can't believe Bohemia made us pay another $20 for a beta
1	Pretty decent so far and more to come.
1	 but I still don't find anyone."
1	Really fun and immersive game considering it is in early access. There is some desync issues in the servers with more players but other than that I have been having a great time. Can also pee and poop in the game. This is the future in gaming.
1	Amazing game! Amazing development team!
1	's alright
-1	At this time no.
1	very realistic and fun early access title. some bugs here and there but other than that everything is amazing
1	Still a better game than H1Z1 and DayZ combined !
-1	trash
-1	Wow.  I hope it gets better.  Would have rather given $20 to a homeless person if I knew it was going to be this bad and frustrating.
1	 but thats just me."
1	thumbs up folks
-1	It's.. so.. boring...
1	Awesome Game! :)
1	The release was a little rough but it's great game overall
1	 active devs updating the game 24/7 ! 8/10!"
-1	 but developers who don't even include the most basic functions (server filters etc.) probably do not have the capabilities of making a proper game. I see the same story as with DayZ here. Couldn't care less."
1	 the game has a lot of potential to be great."
1	 and it runs pretty smooth but it's trying to murder my GPU."
1	 which will most likely be added in the near future.-they just added a working anti-cheat :DTHE BAD (temporal things)-the optimization is really bad. Even the guys with overkill rigs get low FPS so if you dont have a gaming PC it is going to be very unplayable. I know this situation will improve over time.They are real hard working devs and in the past few devs my performance has increased <3 and it is only going to get better."
-1	This game reminds me too much of Day Z...A lot of running...Little to no loot...Feeling hungry? Too bad.Feeling dehydrated? Too bad.Need to heal? Too bad.Found a gun but no ammo? Too bad.Change name from Scum to No Item Found.
1	 but they patched it quick and the server I was on held up great after that. Fist impression are really good and the game feels very thought out and fun. Recommended."
1	 with a few surprises here and there."
1	Great game so far you find loot pretty well unlike dayz. Hell i took a dump down a chimney the poop has fricken physics. Its a pretty hardcore game so if your into hardcore survival games this is definitley worth a pick up!
1	 then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development."
-1	 waiting for updates but couldnt play yet"
-1	 the desync makes it unplayable for me."
1	Extremely promising game. Some issues but nothing more than would be expected for an early access game. Dev's seem to be working constantly to improve and update the game. Can't wait to see where this game goes.
1	i like it
1	Amazing game we just need better transportation. The map is too big to not have any transportation.
1	 look no further."
-1	 so many hours played to get stuff that you can't refund anymore. Well done making it so long to test the real gameplay that you can't refund.I don't recommend this for any lone player at all."
1	A fun survival game with more depth than I expected. Great to play with friends. It will be perfect once the new content is released.
1	Ive played a few hours on this already and im enjoying it looking forward to see what else is added in the future
1	Very nice!
1	fun game. more survival than fps though
-1	 game on m2 ssd ( 3200mb/s read 1500mb/s write )"
1	Yes
1	 got killed by a mech ran back to my body and server crashed while i was picking up the gear and got EAC banned for it not exactly impressed by that"
-1	 it might be worth picking up before they inevitably ramp up the price."
1	 frequent updates to issues people have before adding new content is a big plus for me. Interested to see what they will bring next."
-1	FATAL ERROR
1	 and a lot of other EA titles as well and this one has blown me away with it's optimization and stability.  i see the bad reviews and trust me...they're not warrented.  If you like the survival genre then this is not a game you want to pass up. especially with that 20& price tag."
-1	Too slow
-1	 why not just make coffee a food group? Would not recommend."
-1	 and we're not happy."
-1	Nice Game for an early ! But G-portal ? WTF Why G-Portal for the hosting !!!!!! for now i will not recommend the game only because you are using G-portal server are so laggy
-1	If you have 2gb vram or less dont bother
1	 long live the king (SCUM) !!!"
1	iz guud i like it
1	 it wasn't a dealbreaker. The game definitely needs work and I was fully aware of that when I bought it so I am ok with it. If you liked Dayz you will like this...its actually good that we are just at the beginning on this one. Use your own judgement getting the game but for my gaming I enjoy it."
1	This game has so much potential
1	 buy it."
-1	 I'll gladly pay the future full price."
-1	 but no way of getting to them anytime soon.- No food at this point even though we all eat on the way and had full stomachs before leaving- Out of boredom one decides to try and get over to other players.- He died after running into second mech he couldn't see when he set off- He is not running back for an hour so stops playing- We loot some more buildings the three of us and get a gun and a little ammo each- No idea if players here anymore- Trying to work out what to do now- Realise anything we do now will involve at leat 45 minutes run.- Realise to get where there COULD POSSIBLY be players could be a 1-2 hour run.- Realise we have done everything the game has to offer in terms of group MP- All quit unlikely to play again until major content and mechanic updates.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game has huge potential and looks great. Theres the base for a classic game here. Just needs to decide what its going to be and then make the actual game mechanics for either PvP or purest survival actually fun and not tedious.Desperately needs something for players to do.My opinion is to wait and see how it turns out. We can only judge the game on what it is now and right now its a solid proof of concept demo with masses of promise. Yet not actually a fun game in its current state.UPDATE:Power tripping moderators"
1	 strength etc etc. that you can apply in the character creation screen before you jump into it but i beleive it increases in game while you perform said attributes related.The gameplay is smooth overall but can be clunky in melee battles the the UI is outdated similar to all games mentioned above with that being said this game is leaps n bounds ahead of Day Z not to mention that Day Z has been in development for 5 years lol and is way cheaper i beleive this is a steal in my opinion course the game is in early access so the game is not in its final state and things may or will change over the course of its lifetime but if your like me and see the potential then help those devs out with a purchase! I approve ^_^v"
1	Its very good for Early Acess and price.It lacks some content and is not optimized but is already great for 16 euros
1	Well worth the $20 if you like a dayz style game survival game. Do not buy it if you are expecting to be in combat all the time. I play more of the survival/ exploration aspects of game and am having a great time. I also play solo on near 45+ capacity servers.The game has some network issues (that the devs working on and have already patch to some extent). But given the direction the game will be going I think its worth it to play it a bit now and then check back from time to time to see whats going on with it.
-1	Pros:-Killing teammates is funCons:-All other things
-1	walking simulator 2018
1	 very enjoyable"
-1	ravioli ravioli. i couldn't open a can of ravioli
-1	 high loot areas already filled up with campers that already has military gear and lots of guns and they will kill you before you get into building.So yeah in my opinion this game shouldnt be out yet in current state i asked for refund they didnt accepted it bc i have 11 hours they say i should have lower than 2 hours of game time to ask for a refund so keep that in mind if you want refund..."
-1	I would definitely wait until this game makes some progress. It is very clunky and pretty barebones outside the usual military base and such that most of the DayZ players are accustomed to. As always just stay cautious of any Early-Access games including this one no matter the developer and development notes released.
-1	 well youre starting from scratch. I know this is to stop people gearing up on empty servers but isnt that why the mechs are there? Plus the shear amount of servers means that the population is stretch thin. IMO you couldve followed suit with Breaking Point and not let people host their own to keep the official servers populated. All in all its a great game. That will only get better but I dont understand why they've released in this state. Its only going to hurt the number of people who will stick around till the final build."
1	 really fun but can be frustrating some times.I rate this game: 7.5/10Give it a try!"
1	Launch day and it has more content than DayZ that is in development for five years.
-1	 however i am confident it will improve as the game progresses through early access."
-1	Spent 2 hours looting and having fun with my friends only to die to a hacker.Watching my friend poop blood was funny though.
1	Good but hard game :)
1	Amazing game 10/10 right now considering it's in early access. One thing wrong with it is there is a not steep enough learning curve but as long as this game keeps on with it's current road map it will become one of the best or even THE best hardcore PvP survival game out there. Amazing work guys!
1	You can eat poisonous mushrooms without consequences10/10Edit: Watch out I was wrong
-1	garabge game opens on second moniter wont let you change moniter
1	 one of the better games I've played this year. Buy it. Try it. Love it."
1	 I played single player only) and the feeling like a weird pubg/dayz/rust generic survival with zombie-things clone. I look forward to seeing this game develop in it's entirety though."
1	 keep going!"
-1	 not just team deathmatch. The game has a lot of great potential but right now i do not recommend this game."
1	Best pooping simulator on the market tbh.
1	How can I transfer my server from China into US?
1	 a stunning map and the usual player interactions you expect in this sort of game.8/10 looking forward to what's to come."
1	!!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!! !!!!! need blacklist system !!!!!
1	Game taught me about mushrooms and which mushrooms give me diarrhea.10/10
1	but recently when i join a server i keep getting kicked for my easyanticheat. idk what is going on but i hope they fix it soon..."
1	 the game also runs pretty good."
1	10/10... Can u poop anywhere in another game?I Thought Not.
-1	"since last patch ""Fatal error"" every 5-10 min. :("
-1	i have an i7 8700 and 16g of ram gtx 1050 ti 4g and getting 30fps at low settings wtf is that LOL
1	verry verry fun much shooty shooty havent been killed by human b is push to talk and only been sucked into wall once verry verry fun would buy again
-1	 if not everything is shown."
-1	You are better off buying DayZ or rust. This game is unfinished and horribly boring. The two hours i played of it i never saw another soul or got a gun. Dont be swayed by streamers and youtube videos its not all that fun.
1	 BEAUTIFULLY well made!"
1	 you can always refund the game if you only put 2-3 hours into it and don't like it."
1	 but I feel like I'll be playing this one as much as I have played Rust."
1	 it was a pleasant thing to find it was both unexpected and yet very realistic for the situation - yeah I dont want to spoil those moments for anyone.Well tried not to go too long but give some insight - hope this was helpful to at least a few.-del"
-1	Utter and Absolute TRASH.
1	needs work but devs are doing a great job so far."
1	 the devs are on the ball too."
1	 it's a really fun game.Please nerf them..."
-1	 I won't recommand this game before you fix it."
1	I pooped on somones chest... 10/10
1	 or even just lighting a fire."
1	IT IS EARLY ACCESS!!The only issue I have had so far is server side.There are a lot of things yet to be implemented (Like taking out the overpowered robots..)Other than what is yet to be implemented there is a pretty playable and enjoyable game here.
-1	 cant move and solutions is dead...)- lags"
-1	 but it's just not fun at the moment."
1	 would I be happy playing it?The answer is yes. The games foundations are very solid. I'm looking foward to any additional content."
-1	 I'm going back to Miscreated. Entrada Interactive FTW!!!"
1	Best start to a survival game so far! 10/10 would buy again just to help the development of this game
1	 you cry about nazi tattoo and make the devs to remove it - congrats You save the world!"
1	Love Game well made 100% better then DayZ and Arma 3
1	good
-1	Just another survival game.
1	Makes DayZ look like a shriveled weenie
-1	 45fps on low settings"
-1	"They lowered the zombie/animal spawn by 80% last patch and called it ""First wave of server optimization""... pathetic"
1	 maybe atleast watch the trailer before you play ..."
1	 but the risk is high due to the mechs. Sometimes you could also loot military items from the zombies. The game already has a lot to offer even in its early access stage. $20 dollars is very generous of them. This might be the best survival game out there and it will continue to improve. The devs listen to their player base and acts really quick. this shows that they care about the players and the state of game."
-1	This early access game is way too rough.  The game crashed every single time with out of video memory error.  Perhaps it only works with high end setups.  My 1050Ti 4GB can't run it without crashing.
-1	 can't return due to 4h playtime."
1	 if that is so then someone could peek and get sights on you (before/same time) as they are visible. All in all I think this game can go far."
1	 where that potential heads is up to the Devs."
1	Can I get a server search box? I don't want to wait for the millions of servers to load. I'd apperciate it.
-1	Desync gave me cancer.. refunded for now!
1	 overall pretty good."
1	++
-1	The person I played with was literally.
1	 well this is your game."
1	 very fun. Also how much money did the voice actor get paid to make the constipation noises?"
1	Has a potential to be a great game.
1	 which I've played myself dry off.. and these game makes it look like Minecraft. Lol"
-1	boring AF
1	 its definitely not another DayZ and i would recommend it."
1	Not perfect but the team is putting effort into it!
-1	This game lacks if any direction from the devs.This game is a straight out copy of arma3 exile only diffrence is exile plays better than this  mod.This game has potential but serously lacking any worthy content.The dysnc is a major issue and is completly unplayable.Hopefully with all their new found wealth they can hire some xtra people to fix their net code mess cause i doubt they have the expertise to do it themselves.
-1	BRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFT *plop* SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
1	Survival Game with a lot of potencial!
-1	This game does not run. No menu. wait on buying
-1	 unnecessary and irrelevent people.)Yes I do have a perfect reason to moan as I've watched plenty of videos and even bought the deluxe edition to write this review."
1	Epic game :))
-1	 how on earth has the hype train gone so mad for this?"
1	dayz was a gam. scumk is a gam. snumk is beeter. it pased the frog test. thum up
1	This seems awesome so far! Don't expect too much since it's still very early access.But so far I really enjoy the game and I'm looking forward to experiencing more content.The developers listen to the community and I belive this game has a very bright future.
1	 but it's already a cool game."
1	 don't. Just forget it and buy this before it get's more expensive.It's worth it."
-1	 game seems pretty good besides the sponge from people absorbing 30+ hatchet hits. I'll edit this review in a month if things change."
1	Not even an hour in but already having a blast! Some server issues here and there but that's to be expected of a game that's just released in early access. This game is promising to be great!
1	n1
1	VERY GUT
-1	 tried to change resolution and now the game is stuck and cant even be played. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and its still stuck. No support is responding and its a waste of 20$ Dont even bother youre better off saving your money rather than being scammed like i was"
1	 the game will be great within a year"
-1	 but then I played SCUM."
1	 8gb ram on epic seetings. when i find time i will upgrade this."
-1	 and dying. So fun.........."
-1	Do you like terrible gunplay and laggy servers? Say no more fam... its trash
1	For the first time in a long time a survival game released how it was ment to. Can't wait to see what this game brings.
-1	 but I wouldn't buy it the way it is now."
1	Going to be the best survival game to date just needs time to blossom!
1	Best survival game I have played so far. Finally devs that know what they're doing!
1	 its the ultimate hardcore survival game currently. Having a blast so far overall rating would be an 8/10 but it can improve through more updates and if they fix the d-sync."
1	great game and hasnt even came out yet
-1	 nothing works! Waste of money! Be aware they will scam you for 1/4th of a game!"
-1	waste of time
-1	Running simulator 10/10Hiding robot 8/10
-1	 i almost never like DOF in games but here it is especially overdone and just looks like everything outside of 50 yards has been smeared in vaseline..."
1	10/10
-1	 its garbage"
1	 really fun SP experience that you can tailor the way you want right from the character creation. Best survival experience so far from the zombie genre."
1	Best game ever !
1	You may not like the game in the first 2.5 hours. But you will love it the more you play it. Tipp: Play sneaky and don't risk anything.
1	i've played a lot of dayz. and this game adsolutely blows it out of the water!!!!it runs pretty well for early access and fps is good.
-1	 just go unconcious for a few seconds and wake back up under water."
-1	My Game Crashed all the Time with Fatal Error. tried to Reinstall the GPU Driver reinstall the Game multiple times.nothing Changed still the Crash.dont Have OC tried to play on low Graphics still doesnt work well need to wait for a Patch for that.Still the Game is very good i cant speak for the whole Game because the Game Crashed Everytime after 5-20 minutes. if you dont have the Problem i think you can really enjoy the Game.
1	 and shows lots of potential!"
1	 and above all that is cleans hacker and cheaters regularly and work with the community to improve the game.There is hope in this game."
1	 this has been happening for around 1 hour. Any advice?"
1	 runs better than PUBG and looks at least 250x better to me.Can not wait to see this game to it's (hopefully) full release."
1	Best $20 i've spent on a game hands down.. Buy it to support the game and get your feet wet cause in 6 months this game will be amazing.. its early access so give the devs some feedback.
-1	Right now I feel like I am playing DayZ 2We will see how well these devs deliver with updates later on down the road.
1	 devs attention to details on some points reaches high autistic levels!Recommend more than all battle-royale / survival games !!!"
1	 by ppl who don't even understand the process of EA. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SCUM!"
1	 without smooth interactive pvp no one will continue to play this game!"
1	This game should give lessons to the AAA developers. Game is amazingly beautiful. 1000% better than dayZ. The fame points system and event modes are awesome. The only thing I would complain about is that there are no South African Servers wich forces me to play with 200 ping.
1	 and they've added a anti-cheat. Definitely a fun game."
1	They game needs optimization real bad and the desycn is horrible most of the time but the game overall? pretty game cool and would most definitely recommend it for 20 dollars. Or wait till they fix the problems and then its 40 but up to you
1	 it is still in early access so expect some bugs and glitches. Expect to enter a full server and within 10 minutes be completely cleared by hackers. Hackers run rampant later in the evening and almost makes the game unplayable due to their ""insta-kill-teleport"" hack. It might be worth joining a private server currently while they work on this. The dev team is pretty open about development features and notes but they haven't officially said anything about cheaters yet (Kinda concerning)."
-1	 thus making it unable for me to hit them.6/10 with potential to go up to a 8 or 9 out of 10."
-1	map way too big - auto run script needed - still falling asleep. refunded
1	 but it's got it's charm :)"
-1	 then fill it again. Rinse and repeat. All the while avoiding zombies and mechs when you can.TL;DR Wait 6 months or for some serious updates before buying."
-1	Game is great fun but latest patch breakes the fov fix[/script/engine.localplayer]AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainYFOVLooks like im viewing through a magnifying glass now.
1	have been playing this game for 5 hours now and i must say it's a great game but i needs something
1	 this is just the beginning.  A lot of promise here and I'm anxiously waiting to see where this game goes."
1	Another great sociopath simulator.
-1	 its a tech demo."
1	 and see that this game is a steal for $20."
-1	 a bad version of life simulator. 0/10JUNK"
1	 PUBG and Unturned."
1	Playing the game makes u wanna touch yourself. XoXoScum > DayZ
1	 and now with anti-cheat hacking is much less of an issue. In my opinion the best pure survival game you can play right now in 2018"
-1	i would rather just play dayz because at least dayz is a lot less buggy. Its just another running simulator.
1	 everyone praisaes the overall beauty of the environments (wich I second too) but the skymap is awful at night."
1	I was enjoying a beautiful sunset. Then a goat came around and mowed me down. Died because of blood loss10/10 never seen something like this
1	 this DayZ/hunger games crossover has blown me away so far. Visually stunning and very in depth. A lot of fun with squad mates too!"
1	 8/10 - Will EDIT this review after a half year."
1	 Does more than DayZ has in 5 years."
-1	 they causes you to die most of the times from random things."
1	 even if you never turn it on.Because when it comes out of EA it's gonna be the best hardcore survival simulation ever."
1	 it is a buy without question. Before the small patch I would of said wait but they are making it very obviouse that even though it is early acces they are on the ball for there fans."
-1	na rate my review as funny please thank you!!!!
1	Super scum. Decent game.
1	 way more fun playing with friends and not solo. I'm excited to see what get's implemented in the game during the early access period and what it becomes for full release. As long as devs stay active and stick to their word to provide ""The best survival game"" this has my full thumbs up."
1	 otherwise im loving everything and cant wait for more of the stuff you guys come up with."
1	 first time i spawned in i was fully geared whitin 5 minutes and that takes away alot of the fun around survival. The things that are currently hardest to find : Ammo & food. Buy it if you want to support the devs and help test it while they develop this game."
1	yeet
1	 it is still EA so obv some issues are there but overall it is def one of the better smoother releases.I cannot wait to see how this game develops over time.TOTALLY worth the 20 bucks and it will increase in price as more features are added etc so you get an early adopters discount."
1	 and watch it as it happens. The little scratch and sniff in the end is hilarious."
-1	game is good until you look at the metabolism tab and it gets more complicated than real life.6/10 needs more content
1	Game is fantastic even in its current state .Graghics are stunning and gameplay is challenging
-1	 chief."
1	region lock pls too many chinese
-1	Its a Day -Z with no guns lmao and if you find one good luck finding a player
1	dont have many asian server . food easy to find but weapon and ammo so very rare to find. The game got lot of potential . XD
1	Playing an EA title this Hyped on launch day was guaranteed to be a frustratkng experience. I nevertheless enjoyed myself
1	+1
-1	 boring zombie NPC's and some silly design decisions (namely crafted items don't go in to your inventory right away)."
1	 one shot you and loot you. You can't even report enemys that hack or anything else...Cya"
-1	Another DayZ. Kill on sight galore.
1	 heavy survival mgmt so its a fun option if you dont like multiplayer or just want to learn the game mechanix.Im not sure why people dont like this."
1	 but feels a little incomplete. Needs to be filled out more. But the towns and houses are obviously put together with care and attention to detail.To me it's worth the twenty bucks. Haven't played a game this addictive for a while."
1	 once the desync issues are fixed the game will be incredible."
-1	Got looted at airfield logged out next day logged in keep getting kicked from the server after 10 seconds of logging in
1	 wish they could be killed and looted though. Cant wait to see crafting and building."
-1	The lag during a gunfight is unreal when the guy is in your sights and all of a sudden hes 5 feet to the right is not a playable game. Once fixed il look into the game more.
1	Best Early Access Game I've ever played. It even works on my potato laptop!
1	I like this game but I think the only problem is dropping your gun just from doing a simple task.
1	 die. repeat.8.5/10"
1	this game is very fun and really realistic. 5/5
1	miscreated and dayz had a kid
1	 and the player base will continue to grow."
1	dayz 2.0
1	 getting better every day with devs who genuinely seem to care."
1	this game is very engaging and it going to be veery good when it is fiished
1	 so there are going to be issues."
1	 100% worth the price"
1	 rust and miscreated it's like a mashup of all games combined"
-1	 rysen 5 and 1 ter hardrive and the fps drops make this game near unplayable any time any zombies are near. Player movement in general is almost more limited then the zombies which are near impossible to kill without a weapon or in large groups"
1	 etc."
1	Love it!
1	 great with friends :)"
1	its nice
1	love this game. obviously not finished but its the beta. can't wait to see what they do with the game. i reccomend a buy to support and play cuz its pretty fun as is
-1	 and saw nothing and heard no one. Playing hide and go seek with the robots was as intense as it got."
-1	hello im so mad right now please remove the idiot robots they are so annoying remove them please.
-1	meh
-1	Not worth in the current state
-1	 aimless and frustrating experience and the lack of good keybinds make it even worse."
1	 it certainly deserves to be tried."
1	DayZ we deserve
1	Good!!
1	Stop... This is a game changing game. They are crafting a next gen experience here. It will take you 22 min to understand what they are doing here. Once you see this detailed and refreshing take on the survival game it's $22 cost is a deal. It is worth it.
1	so far i've played 20 hours on this game and i gotta tell ya it's hella fine
-1	garbage
-1	 bad connectivity. This has potential and hopefully will be upgraded and this won't go down as DayZ 2.0."
1	The way SCUM handles problems with survival games is pretty brilliant. The skills system's effect on gameplay is pretty cool and evens the playing field so those with supercomputers can't set their render distance to highest and see you sooner.Netcode is iffy and the memory leaks are bad. It's pretty barebones content wise too. They sold a lot of copies of this so let's hope they finish it properly.
1	 weapon play etc... Considering it's early access it's going to be AMAZING a little further down the line..."
-1	 hard hitting lag spikes. And the overall gaveplay is just dingy...#refunded"
1	Pooping is rewarding
1	good videogameproper comfy
-1	 hackers. It's fun gearing up for hours just for someone to tele next to you and end it all. Won't be back until something has been done about it."
1	 the game world is nice as well as the survival mechanics. A welcome addition is the Hunting mechanic when you are searching for food.Needs Fishing which i believe the Devs are working on. has recieved numerous hotfixes and patches since its release.Server optimisation is needed and again i believe the developers have this as a priority.If the devs do not drop the ball  this promising game it could become the survival game that Dayz inspired to be."
-1	 just to be instantly killed by a hacker. Hackers compromise this game's viability and I don't think there is going to be an easy solution for this. I might reinstall in 3 months time and see if anything has improved."
1	 since the game is just out I would hope so.  Let's see if that stays the case."
-1	 wtf ?."
1	 but you gifted me one of my best moments in gaming in months"
1	 the game runs wonderfully and there's plenty of things to do and explore."
1	amazing game for just releasing defiantly needs more content and better loot tables. You search a whole village and get one piece of paper yet at airfield you get amazing loot which is good because high risk high reward but i should be able to comfortably get started lotting a big town. Besides this i love the game benn waiting for it for a long time and can see so much potential 10/10 would recommend with friends
-1	fail to fine server
1	Love the game! Promising future
1	This game is like DayZ BUT with developers :))) !!
1	 I would like to see current weapon ammo being given a server check if possible and maybe a moving too fast check to prevent teleporting.Still every game has issues at launch and the developers seem to be working to get anitcheat in and fix the issues so can't really give it a bad review just because of people who can't play without cheats."
1	looks like a good game that could have alot of potential :)
-1	44 fps@1080p nvidia 970 all low..... uhm
1	great game!
-1	SO laggy to the point that pvp is not possible. You only can get lucky by spraying or shooting randomly at someone in hopes of hitting someone. FIX the laggyness and then it would be a great catch for the start of a great game. Until then. My review is beyond negative.
1	Love it.
1	Phenomal Game. BUY THIS AMAZING PIECE OF ART WORK RIGHT NOW!
-1	 GPortal exclusivity doesn't do a damn thing but put more money in the devs pocket."
1	 let's hope the devs take this wonderful foundation and build us an even more amazing house to play around in."
1	Amazing game. Can't wait to see how it progresses in the coming months and years.
-1	 I imagine this is not a good sign for this game."
-1	 let the developers work for their money by actually making the game playable."
1	 getting average 45 frames (everything on the lowest) with a low-mid gaming pc.Overall worth it."
1	It's a really good game but when it comes to combat its garbage i was fighting some guy and all of a sudden he turns invisible this really needs to be fixed
-1	 but for now: refund. Rip."
1	It's like DayZ and The Forest had a baby and I can cannibalize the poor players that wandered into the wrong building to scavange.
1	Guuccci
1	Still has bugs but the Devs are busy patchingIS worth the $20 all day longIt's alot of fun and I think it will get even better with time
-1	 this game is for you."
1	Pretty good!
1	this game is awsome i would buy it again ;)
1	 and the devs certainly care about combating cheaters!I will continue to play and support this game if its progress continues!PS: I'd love to get my hands on the server files as I run my own gaming servers for my gaming community!"
1	i like
1	 considering it takes ages to level up the skills."
1	this is very good to stay alive xD really I love it
-1	 there's no way I could recommend that anyone buy a walking simulator that has all of the free roam certification of ArmA and none of the charm (or loot availability) of PubG. Wait for further updates."
1	 SCUM is already the best survival game ever."
1	 met some other players who didnt shoot on site (most do though)Looking forward to some more contact & content.The robots make getting better gear a challenge.Not sure I like the little drones that come and check up on you...they really bugger up stealth.better than dayz standalone so far....vehicles would be super"
1	its a good game off the back yes there is bugs but thats every game in early accessand u can poop off the roof so that means the game is good
1	It is EA so need a lot of work and content but the core elements are briliant. Definitely worth the money.
-1	 it can improve greatly or fail miserably."
1	Nice i took a huuuge poop in it!!!!
1	 so that's great and I changed the recommend. As long as the rest of the bugs are fixed eventually."
-1	worst game I've ever bought in my life
1	 and uncertainty no game has ever shoved against my face before. There is so much to cover in this game that I honestly feel like any review that I can write wont be enough.6.8/10 I urge you to give this a try."
1	I hope to resolve the server lag as soon as possible
1	 However bear with the game and what you have is an absolute pleasure and a laugh to play.Only 25 Hours in but far superior to PUB-G and DayZ neither of which i enjoyed.I cant wait to see how the game developes as it matures."
-1	The most shallow game masquerading as a 'deep and thoughtful survival game'
1	 like the direction H1Z1 went. H1Z1 Devs ruined survival in that game. This is the only Survival game worth playing right now IMHO."
1	I just got it because I heard you could poop in it.
1	really enjoying it so far
1	 has already responded to a problem with a super fast patch to fix the problem. Will update review on a later notice when I have played more and more patches has been come out."
-1	nah.
1	 very exited for this game"
1	 you need video card over Nvidia GTX 1050Ti and some powerful CPU! If you have GTX 1050Ti or lower.... just forget it."
1	 craft furniture etc"
1	Dont let the time fool you.. ive been playing the early alpha and beta.. This game is amazing.. clearly at the time being you make your own fun but if you have any kinda imagination and you like this genre.. this game is for you! Dont let the stupid negative reviews fool you.. ITS THE FIRST DAY some servers are a lil overloaded but theres 100s of servers that are fine. if you like dayz you will love this. These devs care unlike so many others..
1	 this is quite acceptable. Looking forward to further patches and seeing this game improve and grow!"
-1	 still stuck in same place."
-1	Early access really is a plague on the gaming world
1	 get a clue.  Can't wait to see whats added to the game in the future."
1	this game is soo good that i buy 2 copys! best survival game on steam!!!
1	Great game a must buy
1	 they have to optimize it and fix it.Do not buy for now."
-1	 we really don't need more zombie-walking-pvp-""survival simulators""."
1	 i'm running it and i don't even meet the Minimum Requirementsm"
1	deadpeople dont swim but run underwater"
1	 they said they are fixing the servers and the lags. this is day 1 of launch. i support it"
-1	 but then it's still just a nice looking version of many other Zombie servival games.  Can't honestly recommend at this point."
1	AWSM game but low fps.
1	 but it has a lot of support and I'm already impressed by dev involvement."
1	 but every update forwhatever reason never wants to download properly.. 40mb updates want to take 40hrs to download before finally coming down to 20 mins with a 30 min install. seems glitchy in that aspect as this is my only steam game this happens too. weird.."
-1	I would recommend you get it after early access because it is a great idea/concept but it needs some time to fix everything and develop a whole lot more. Also the traveling to SOOOO much time they need to add cars.
1	 but easy to craft ANYTHING) - Everything has a nice animation - It's metabolism system is very unique and useful - A real AI challange with every encounter!What is the problems with Scum then? - Player have that mini teleport glitch at times - You could loot a whole town and find 7 things - The Robots in this game can see from 1-180 degrees and 1 shot if they see you"
1	 you got a game here!"
1	fun
1	 Scum is the Zombie Survival game to rule them all. Everything you wanted from DayZ standalone and everything thats come since.  Get this game while its cheap and you can. because your going to regret it down the road when your stuck paying full price.  Devs are pushing updates damn near daily.  <3 this game."
1	new dayz pretty much
1	Your game version must match server version ? How to fix ????I deinstall the game and install again still not working please help !!!
1	 no one plays private servers after last patch:DThe official servers are so busy we can't even join anymore :D"
1	killed a goat then sacrificed it to the dark lord 10/10
-1	 then save your money. Go back to dayz or h1z1."
1	 great job devs!"
1	 but other than that its okay."
1	.
1	"Good game that has a lot of potential.  However it has a lot of cheaters in the game.  Most folks will teleport to you and kill you in one shot.Hopefully they are able to fix this. Even the ""anit"" cheat is not helping.  I have yet to play a fair game in any public servers. Had fun in private servers with some friends.  Don't play public servers yet."
1	 refund it *shrugs*."
-1	 I got my $20 worth and am happy with the purchase. I can only hope that one day the game will play without too many issues. We'll see."
1	 outstanding game.  Cant wait to see what comes next."
-1	Bad game overall
1	 and perhaps a lil more difficulty surviving maybe dangerous animals and more zombies/puppets. An pvp needs to be fixed. However this game is still amazing innovative and fun! I recommend and hope it doesnt get left by the wayside in development."
1	This game is going places.
-1	 there was a lot of hype. But my review is: meh."
1	 haven't done any pvp but have a nice camp set up with good raiding spots Still has some work to go but it has a fantastic backbone to build off"
1	 very polished. Can't wait to see how good the finished product will be."
1	Me and my mate have played about 10 hours of scum and i have to say it is very fun and refreshing it needs work but that comes with early accsess games i am really excited to see what new content comes to this game i am well and truly hooked!
-1	 early access killed it . WIll try again in half a year."
1	 the dev's are doing a really good job at communicating and attempting to address concerns. 10 of 10 will poop in unfortunate times again."
1	You can poo on people after you've killed them.10/10
-1	Very dissappointed. this game LACKS material. do not waste your money untill they make another update and add game content. i would return this and get my moneyt back if i could. https://store.steampowered.com/app/513710/SCUM/#
1	 but devs seem to be on top of things and the game seems very promising."
1	It's a great survival game.I has few bugs here and there but it is just Early Access.One issue that I ran into was when I was chased by a group of zombies then i ran into a building and closed the door behind me and they just phased through the wall.But overall it's really fun to play and I would recommend.
1	Arma 3 Exile meets Hunger Games meets German Porn. Dope.
1	 so good.  Looking forward to see what else gets added tot he game by the developer.  Very active developer makes me confident I'll be playing this game for months to come."
1	 would be fed own corpse again."
-1	I cannot recommend this game as we cannot host our own servers on our own machines.
-1	 because that's what you'll be doing in game."
1	 will cause all other delevopers headaches to match never mind better.You must remember that this game is Early Access and as such the content is limited right now.  It will come..Have Fun."

1	Best Prison Wallet Simulator 11/10
1	100%  WORTH THE $$$$$$$
1	SCUM is a game I can stand by and support. Dont have the 10 for the dlc but ill get it soon. I want people to start giving quality design ea games good reviews. If I felt like the devs didnt care about the design of the game and it seems to have NO potential then i warrant a bad review. Why kill player numbers or not help the numbers over cons that are PURELY a flaw of being EA but no a review of the game itself. This game reminds me of infestation: the new z which i liked really well even though the graphics are dated. This is just like that but better physics. I enjoy making zombies follow me while i loot. Then i can kill 3 dummass playas tryna to melee him hahaah see u on the field bois.THE 1 EA FLAW I GOT CARRIED AWAY FROM is the lag when fighting SOME players I suspect there are not many foreign servers as of yet. BUT those 3 guys and the guy i killed at the mech base didnt have any lag and the game ran great pz
1	 turn on the comments for the review so I can b*tch you out."
1	Awesome EA Looter shooter cant wait for what the future holds for this game keep up the mad work Devs xoxo
-1	Worst game I have played in my entire life!
1	made by gamers for gamersscum is an epic game for the best gamers. robots pwn the noobs its epic. haters gonna hate...
1	 something i hope will come later.Game score:Early access ready 9/10Game 8/10 Loot 8/10Fixing of bugs/updates 9/10Price 10/10"
1	 but i love this game so realistic."
1	 when we spawn we should spawn on the same location(friend only) in the same area one more thing we can help our friend from knock out by zombies or another player! server slot can start from 5slots with the low price!"
1	7/10
-1	 none of them worked."
1	 I'm always finding something new and there is just enough food/drink to keep yourselves healhty. Backpacks are hard to come by but easy to craft in a complex crafting system that I am yet to fully explore.The metabolism stats are intresting but i haven't really seen any of them making any major effects as of yet.With more time I think this could be a very good game and I'm looking forward to what the devs do to improve this game.I would recommend this game for anyone wanting a survival game."
1	this game is like dayz if it was a filthy frank skitoh also if dayz actually had developers
1	 but it would be nice if there was a history option.  I've been playing on multiple servers and its hard to track down that last few servers i was on.  Also it would be nice if there was a search function on the server list.....kinda like rust....:).  So far this game is great!!!!"
1	So i have been playing for an 1h and what i have to say its this game have a really good future i think that some people will think wrong about the game before playing it you guys will really enjoy it
1	best 20 spent in a long time.Get it."
-1	this game is a joke already
1	 grab it up!"
1	 when you play it 10h on the first day of the purchase."
-1	dis game doo doo
-1	 no base building/fortifying. Glitchy zombies and the wildlife teleport everywhere. 2/10 dont buy"
1	 I have played dayZ and Scum is already way better. I had no bugs within 2 hours of playing with friends. They also keep bringing up updates daily and I am excited to fly choppers and drive like they announced."
1	 and active devs"
1	Should be free for the owners of DayZ
1	best $9.00 game purchase ever.
-1	Game has potential however situation with the robots locking on and one tapping you no matter what gear you're wearing just becomes old and repetitive.Will update review when new patches are released.
1	 this is  early access and that we as gamers can steer this game in the direction we want.  Capt. J. Briggs"
-1	I just feel this game is like every other zombie survival game. Nothing new and innovative. This is basically a DayZ ripoff in my eyes. But it might actually have a full release.
-1	 but if i'm being honest you'd get much better value from that game. I predict the roleplayers will take this game over in the future."
-1	 this is not the game for you."
-1	 however at this present moment it is in an unplayable state. I'm going to give this game a miss for a few weeks until things get ironed out more. A lot of glitchy things happening and unresponsive actions etc."
-1	RIP Game... these hackers everywhere <3
-1	Unneccesarily complicated and just not fun to play in its current state.
-1	 turrets shooting and seening you through walls and cheaters - thats your pick!"
1	 whould be a lot better if you just removed 3:d person!"
1	 in a 25 person server bc map is so huge. But so far the ones I have come upon are funny and helpful.Great survival/fps/exploration/ hybridGet it"
-1	 it is not suitable for release at this point in my opinion."
-1	Cannot reccomend this game until they stop deleting my Character everytime there is an update.No point putting hours of work in to find my character gone when i log back in.
1	I put a whole AK mag into somone and they didn't die. They then shot me in the head with a shotgun.
-1	WT.....?Searching for hour's for some crappy loot...starve to death....yes that's what you can expect.
-1	I just can't recommend this game in its current state. Though i'm sure it has potential to become better.I'll likely re-purchase thid game in a few months and see what its like then
-1	 update and fix your engine."
-1	Do not buy this game unless you have 6+ gb of VRAM. You can hardly play it with anything less. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE RECOMMENDED FOR THIS GAME! It is a complete lie. if you're not rolling with a 1080 6gb+ then have fun with the lowest setting of graphics and occasional frame spikes especially in towns. This game is horribly optizimized and even has player latency in servers. A real garbage game for people who aren't rich.
-1	 game still in development and needs more work! Wait for the final release before you buy!"
1	Whoever is addicted with stats this game is a must.
1	 east to pick up and understand. So far its not cancer like some of the other titles in the genre."
1	just started playing and i love this game. 8/10 so far. also just started a server and im looking for admins. Americas Most Wanted    172.107.179.169:28202
-1	STILL CAN NOT GET ON THIS GAME DUE TO SECURITY ISSUES FFS ......15 quid down the pan I WILL NOT RECOMEND .......
1	Great game. There are some optimization issues (expected from an early access game) but there are a few articles to get your game running at a stable 60+ FPS.
-1	 dayz and h1z1 and many ither survival games this one is the worst yet."
1	FPS 17
-1	DON'T BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!! wait until the they update the game is not even playable right now.......
1	 come hang out."
1	 DayZ has been dead for a long time now and this game cannot be said to kill something which is already long dead.TL;DR: So far so good."
1	 don't get the game yet. I personally don't mind so its all fun!"
-1	 it's an EA game (EARLY ACCESS) meaning there is a ton of work to be done to the game. Currently the game is great fun but I'm not recommending it on the basis of one thing ""HACKERS"" what I mean by that isn't real hackers as 99% of the morons don't have a clue what a Class Object even is let alone know how to really hack. Unfortunately the game has been out for less than a week and the hackers are in storm. I spent less than 1hr on the game and BAM instakilled."
1	 this game has it all and more."
-1	 but that's only if this goes anywhere."
1	10/10 would poop in front of robots again
1	What DayZ should have been!
1	It's an early access game with your typical early access problems. The core idea of the game is fantastic and the game is fun. The developers thus far have been very good about communication with the community and as such I have high hopes for this game. For $20 it's definitely worth a purchase if you're interested.
1	 plz send help."
-1	Another awful early access indie game
1	 an enjoyable looting system and a great developer/publisher team on board.I highly recommend to those who love these types of games."
1	 guess it's too late now. 7 days into early access and it's already more polished than a game stuck in EA for about 5 years..."
1	Great game. I was worried about PVP but after patches dync was fixed and it is very enjoyable to PVP now.  It can only get better but it is already worth the money.
1	Awesome atmosphere and the perfect mix of PUBG and DayZ with a Forest-style crafting system!
-1	 its fun to play with a few friends for a few days but i'd reccomend DayZ .62 over this at the end of the day."
1	 but me and my friends do enjoy doing events"
1	 but i mean hey theres a fishermans hat so i give it a solid 22/10"
-1	 dead game now."
-1	 so of course you die. Then you restart with negative points.....great......."
-1	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THERE IS NOTHING TO DO AT ALL NO ANIMALS NO PEOPLE ONLY 2 PUPPETS IN THE 3 HRS I PLAYED. NO PROGRESSION. LITERALLY A BODY SIMULATOR WHICH IS ALSO BAD BECAUSE AFTER 15 MIN I AM STARVING AGAIN. ALSO NOT ONE TIP ON WHAT TO DO IN THE GAME. ALSO THERE IS NO END GAME AS OF NOW. ALSO FOR ABOUT AN HOUR I COULD NOT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THE SERVERS WOULD NOT LOAD
1	 I am all in on Scum!"
1	good so far and the skill system is good
-1	Trash... Its like a poorly scripted dayz mod server . Another reason why early access is the cancer  Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefund
-1	 game runs poor & no loot and laggy servers.RefundedR.I.P"
1	 cause robots.The combat is much more linear then dayz's.So far I didn't use any guns. I'm trying to get past some robots to get in a bunker.Overhaul: I approve.My only problem so far is that the game overheats my lepaop."
1	 will update soon"
1	Really fun has that superb survival game feel to it and the player customisation is amazing! Thats what sold me on the game how much detail they put into it. Yes they have had server issues on launch day but that will be fixed and single player can still be played. Server issues are to be expected with a lot of player joining launch day 90% of EA games do. If your going to winge about it then wait until they have brought some updates out. Don't buy EA games if your going to moan about glitches lol. Brilliant game though so excited about this game.
1	 but also a few out in the forest.The sound is a little funky. I can hear water when im in the middle of the forest but there isnt nay water or rain nearby. Its early development so Im keeping an open mind. I hope this game becomes something big. Keep up the good work guys!"
-1	Optimization 10 fps /10 Idea 3/10Physic 2/10 CONSCIENCE OF DEVELOPERS 0/10 The worst game I've ever played
1	 and whatever else they plan to add a PVE element.CONS:Now there is only really one major con that I have. And that is the performance. It would run smoothly but every now and again it would hiccup and freeze my game for a few seconds. One time before I got off It froze for a good 30 seconds. But hopefully that is fixed in the future. Other than that pretty much what I expected which is a great thing."
-1	Fix memory leak pls
1	This game is what everyone wanted from DayZ but more. It is beautiful and just a great game in general. I would give this game a 8/10 just because there is a little bit of connection issues but what can you expect when this many people join in and the developers didn't anticipate this amount. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games such as Rust or DayZ.
1	very good game i highly recommend for everyone i really im in love with it thank you sooo much devs <3
1	 sure it has some kinks but considering it just went live 3 - 4 hours ago yeah its gonna need some work. Servers have been unstable but thats kind of expected dont think anyone quite realized how many people would be trying to get in right away. Devs are awesome and really active on discord. Keep up the good work!"
-1	 but at the moment it is a little bit over-hyped in my opinion."
-1	 so that should give you a pretty good idea of how poorly this game is optimized.... 28fps on minimum settings and resolution...."
1	 solidifying its core survival aspect. 9/10 thus far"
1	 can't wait to see what it becomes over time. (Will edit as more features get released)"
-1	I really had high hopes for this game but this game has problems off the rip.The servers don't work and the game isn't optimized and also why do you need to make a new charectar everytime you try to join a server that doesn't even work.
-1	 then ten seconds later I equiped a new backpack and my original backpack became stuck and unable to re equip and i lost all my good items.  Very dissapointing."
1	Just pooped out an apple. Not hungry anymore. 10/10
1	 so its worth the money."
1	It's pretty damn good!
1	 but needs some better servers and i guess a better netcode"
1	 but seriously it's amazing"
1	 I still wouldn't hesistate to recommend this game to anyone tired of the shallow loot-and-shoot that most survival games have become!"
1	 but if you're on the fence I'd hold off and wait for them to complete the game a little more."
1	 it's already more robust than DayZ and a fraction of the price (when I bought it).I wholeheartedly reccomend this game and I look forward to following it's development"
1	 I'm sure this is going to be an absolutely amazing game during full release!"
1	By far the best game I've played in a long time! The game I've always wanted since 2013! Fresh new elements and beautiful sceneryI could survive and roam for hours and enjoy this game immensely!
1	>spend 1 hour hiking through a square>spot another character>naked guy starts screaming and pooping>I approach with uncertainty and say hello>de-sync so bad I die by getting punched to death by a naked screaming manGOTY.
1	 at the moment there is not much of a game."
1	This Is by Far one of the best survival games out there.
1	its pretty good
1	 good game."
-1	refunded. game is bad. stick to the other copies like h1z1 or dayz.
-1	Game is extremely broken. Not worth the $20 right now. Very empty but when you do come upon a person or animal combate is impossible. They will glitch out all over the place. Don't buy
1	 but for what it's worth definitely recommend."
1	Bring back the Neo Nazi Tattos brings a sense of realism and showing that these are terrible people and are actually SCUM of the earth
-1	 severely disappointed"
1	Running around aimlessly and starving to death has never been so fun!
-1	i know its new but it shouldn't lag like this .. as for the pack .. when u pee or poop ur underwear is still on reguardless"
1	good
1	 Please Dev: Add Weed in the game like we can cultivate and with effect on metabolism PLEASE"
1	noice
1	Three words: I love it.
-1	 Please remove the OP pieces of Crap and maybe have millitary areas infested with puppets or something.ATM dont recommend because of the OP robots."
1	Great survival and it's only going to get better from now on.
1	 it will only get better with time"
1	 the devs made an excellent work and I expect nothing but greatness from this title. Big thanks to all the devs that made this game possible."
1	 I am excited to see how this game grows. 10/10"
1	 this is getting the genre into the new level. Worth trying up."
1	I like scissors
1	It functions and it runs alright. More than expected.
1	Plays really well. Enjoying it very much except for the 2560x1080 resolution which cuts the map down when on full screen. The majority of D1-4 are missing and the bottom half of A1-4 are missing. Playing windowed 1707x1066 becasue of this. On a 34' LG ultra wide. Please help/fix
1	Temp
1	Very spicy and good game 10/10 one of the best survival games from my experience just one thing devs add handcufs or something to mess around with your friends
-1	 doesn't let you join on friends via steam or tell you what server they're on. Even more annoying that half the servers are all named ""SCUM server"" so good luck picking the right one that your friend joined. Seems like all the servers that arent password protected are always set to night time. You get injured jumping to the floor that is 5ft below you. You lose 30% HP jumping down a 5ft ledge. Performance is surprisingly poor with a 1080ti. Wait until the game is in a better state."
-1	 wait for a few updates and some content theres very little weapons in the game...."
1	 other than that love the game just wish there was some form of transportation."
1	 the concept is certainly cool but spwning using fame points is a bit odd."
-1	 unlike this game"
1	 and they actually f'kn work.Worth the price tag if you ever wanted to play a not-garbage version of DayZ."
-1	FPS. frame drops are unbearable. every time i fire a gun full auto in the airfield my game freezes entirely and i die due to it. It makes the game unplayable and the PvP aspect lacking alot. framesd need fixing first and formost before ill reconsider playing again.
1	 solid game so far. Great PvE Survival game at the moment. Once they fix the server/client side issues than it should be a fantastic PvP game as well."
1	Za best survival game
1	Drunk tow bottles of whiskey in 10 mins. Passed out after 10-15 minutes later and was not able to get up. Went to main menu character was lying on the ground near campfire totally drunk. 10/10
1	 hope to see future updates."
1	Pooping with strangers
1	*teleports behind you* NANI?!
-1	Small amount of bugs. Eg ladders bugged and kar98 bugged. Good experence. Small learning curver for new players to survival games. Very Big Map! Which is good but it takes ages to go anywhere. Mechs in restricted areas are too overpowered and dont drop anything cool. Not a diverse amount of guns. Hopefully most of this is fixed while the game develops. If you are planning to buy this wait a little longer. If you really want it wait for a sale. Hopefully they implement an end goal eg espcaping the island. My wishes for the game are - Bigger arsenal of guns eg m16 or m4a1 and more attachments. - Base building (Like the game 'The Forest' - and vehicles eg cars and helicopters so the game isnt a zombie hiker simulator) To get rid of mechs and replace them with modern turrets and finally i hope they add partrols which players can attack and loot from. Overall im not recommending this game as although it is very fun it is still very empty as there is not alot of content.
1	great game with a ton of potential
1	Best survival game ever!
-1	I was banned from Discussion for 'Trolling'.
1	 got that old Dayz feeling again.THE ZOMBIES WORK!!!"
-1	 game will die like the rest."
-1	PC GAMING CAN GET PURE CANCER. IT SUCK YOU PAY 1000 or more for a god damn pc an d you know what it crashes. fock pc i am going back to console never had any focking problems with it. FOCK PC WITH THEIR OVERPRICED JUNK.
1	1. For a new game thats not done yet it is good it has not crashed on me not one time..2. The graphics is an A++ My PC play on 60fps with lags only sumtimes but not enough to effect the gameplay..3.Hand to Hand combat is really good and there is all kind of stuff to fight with but boxing with your freinds is really fun..4.The crafting on this game is nice to easy to use i cant wait for them to add more stuff to the game to make..5.The PVP on it is also nice and the ppl on this game isnt all bad like most games like this one..6.Its not hard to make a camp and soon there gonna add ways to make your own base..7.The road map for this game looks good makes it to where you cant wait for the next update stuff like car's boats planes NPC'S that fight eachother and u can pick sides that will make single player more fun to play and much more..8.keeping your player alive and moving takes more then just eating and drinking an thats makes the game fun to play..There is a lot more about the game i could talk about but that would take allday but its a good game and it is worth the money and prob. more.. SO IF UR LOOKING FOR A REASION TO GET IT JUST GO BUY IT ALREADY!!!
1	Game has been out for less than two weeks and it feels more finished than dayz lmao
-1	 but crashes computer when joining server game. I've tried several fixes but nothing works. Refunding."
1	Its amazing but they need to add cars and fast.
-1	what a sh..ty survival game...
1	+repmoderate amount of stuff but much potential
1	dont expect much rn its just came out into early access BUT LEMME TELL YA ITS WAY BETTER THAN DAYZ!!! SCUM got a lot of potential and i cant wait for more stuff and FPS fixes
1	yes
-1	 missing a lot of features. ( so far )"
-1	 will run across the map for 40 minutes and then get killed by an invisible guy camping in the woods"
-1	Change the name to Trash. TARGET ENGAGING.
1	 only that this game rocks!"
1	Poop. Puke. Pee. Repeat.Would play again!
1	 but I think it's good how it is. Those mechs always have my heart rate going when im sneaking around in the military areas. Hopefully vehicles and base building will come soon!"
1	NOICE
1	It's fun. Just buy it. It'll get better. It's only 20 bucks you loser.
1	It's challenging!  After a few hours I haven't got past picking up a few tools and killing a few muppets.  I don't recommend hunting a bear if all you have is a sharpened stick.  The game looks good and the map is super big with lots to discover.  It's just really difficult to advance my character before randomly getting pwn3d by something and having to start all over from scratch.
1	 the zombie walk through the wall 11/10 geat game!"
1	good game LUL
1	 devs are super quick to mend any issues in the game."
-1	 that is about the only reason to purchase at this time."
1	>Spend two hours walking to meet up with friends>We all get one tapped as we are trading gear>10/10 would walk a thousand miles again
1	 and im very excited to see where the developers go with this!"
1	Scum is a blast. I'll start by saying that. There are a lot of bad reviews coming out and I feel like it has to do with the confusion of the style of game. It is closer to a hardcore survival game and less of a PVP game. There are PVP elements as well as PVE though.  Ive boxed a gun out of someones hand to get the kill and also died from lack of food. Playing with a group of friends is a blast and ducking bullets from the guard robots can really get the blood pumping. This game has a lot of potential and I suggest picking it up and giving it a try.
-1	 6g graphics card."
1	First time i bought it i played only this and now i cant play other games this game so good w/ good devslooking forward for this game :)
1	 and it's not done yet."
1	This game has the potential to be best survival game to date 10/10 so far.
1	Early Access games with developers that actually listen and work around the clock (as least for the moment) to keep players happy.Really enjoying this game and I think it has something for everyone. It's the best blend of all good shooters and survival games.Check it out!
1	DayZ 5.0 if you liked dayz and enjoy survival games and have a good enough rig i highly reccomend it as the visuals are mesmerizing and highly immersive!
-1	 just everything is wack. if they add in a base building mechanic or something maybe I'd come back but all in all it kinda sucks."
1	 I look forward to the updates!!disclaimer; i have always been a fan of the arma 2 dayZ mod with all its flaws (this is way less flawed)."
1	Great Game For A Great Price. Can't go wrong if your into this genre. . Getting A Solid 50-60 frames . .  10/10 would run into air strip and get sniped by rooftop sniper again .
-1	Hard pass until netcode is fixed at the very least.
1	 even for $20 early access game. I'd recommend it if you've been waiting a game like Day Z that isn't garbage."
1	 everything works as intended and cant wait for more stuff's n thing's in the game!I give this game 8.5/10"
1	 but as an ea game which will constantly change it wouldn't make sense to optimize it"
1	 you will not regret it.Keep up the good work guys.!(Proud to be Croatian) :D"
-1	is pretty good."
-1	 but other areas were also terrible."
1	Best game ever!!....this is must buy if you love hardcore gaming
-1	Hackers in this game already !!!!!!!!!
1	"I am really enjoying this game it's alot of fun I like the crafting mechanic and I think it has been a great launch I have had very  little issues with this game. This game can really get the adrenaline pumping when you hear a MECH say ""Prisoner leave this area"" and then a few seconds later you get shot to pieces!"
-1	Its cr*p. Cant even get past charactor creation cuz its too buggy. Refund on its way
1	 this makes it out of.Couple suggestions:1. Admin Commands on servers2. Reserved spaces for selected players on dedicated servers"
1	Ive only played for a little while and so far i love this game some parts are slow but thats the hole point of grinding in game they take time i look forward to playing many many hours in this game
1	This game is so complicated it is fun! The launch was super smooth for me.  The game runs good for being an early access game. I am enjoying the game so far. I love sneakying around the mechs and running running from zombies. I can't wait to see what they add in the future.
1	 best game I've played for a long time"
1	 and surely the game can only get better as it is updated."
-1	The major flaws SCUM faces at the moment:1) 64 players is not enough for how massive the map is. 2) Spawns. You can't squad up with your mates before the game starts. You have to meet with one another once the game starts.3) Memory leak. The longer the match goes on the more your fps diminishes. You have to log back in every 30min to get good fps again.For $20 SCUM is insanely worth it once these three issues are fixed. The map is beautiful and the game is full of detail. Animations and physics are very good. The connection is impressively solid. I can see all the animations my mates are doing. The game feels in sync with other players and items dropped.
-1	not working cant connect to server
-1	Cannot connect to god damn server do somthing
1	The loading screen has more content than DayZ
-1	 it's super laggy. Will safe the last hour for testing tomorrow and will refund it if problem still be there."
1	Very early review.So far runs pritty well. With this new ubdate they ubdated the server browser and improved loading speeds. If they keep it going its gonna be a good game.
1	servers have been improved
1	 but you better be open to things like bugs because every game will have them."
1	 expect to log the hours that will give me my $20 of entertainment by far."
-1	 it's average and I'd give it a 5/10 because of how well it runs and the mechanics are nice. Refunded"
-1	 unfortunately I can't connect to any servers and when I play on single player my game keeps crashing. Currently I would say this game is badly optimised. Wait until a patch has fixed these issues and postpone your buy."
-1	 jon tench drank from the ocean and I couldn't."
1	 that is to be anticipated with every launch day early access game. Cretins that write negative reviews keep forgetting that it is indeed early access.So far what i have seen has not disappointed one bit. This game is what dayZ could and should have been. And its way cheaper than any ""competition"" out there offering similar gameplay.No reason not to buy this if as the devs have an outstanding reputation with previous games."
1	 better than PUBG 11/10!"
-1	trash
-1	doesnt work. aaron lake got more loot than me. trash.

1	I picked up a can-opener and died instantly. When I respawned I had nothing except the can-opener.
1	this game is pretty good..it has a large open world on my server i am yet to see anyone there are some flaws. but it can be enjoyable..if i knew the point of this game it might be better. the object of the game is to survive but all you really have to do is hit up an army barracks and load up on guns and ammo then sit in the woods and you're pretty much safe. im yet to see the multi-player stuff since no-one is online on my realm ever either that or they dont talk. doesnt matter this game is better solo for me imo. if i knew how to go about the object of this game id have something to do in it. but as of right now my guy is easily surviving doing absoilutely nothing. hes camped out on a farm with plenty of food and ammo:) no zombies aka survivn'

1	very goed gimma yes like it very goed
1	 ha! 10/10"
-1	Its not great
1	An amazing take on the survival genre. Recommend 10/10
1	If your looking for an open world survival game then this is it. Scum is only in alpha and it surpasses many of the survival games that have been out for quite sometime. The developers are working hard to make this into an even better game by adding many things to come. I would highly recommend this game.
1	Very well made. Can't wait to see what else the bring into the game before early access is up.
1	F_ck  Hurtworld
-1	Boring and broken
-1	prosits only $20consit feels like only $20 worth of effort
1	 then cut off his head and made it into a hat. 10/10"
1	I can not see any servers when i refresh but so far its a good game
1	 because i would obviously do that in real life. I've had a few issues with close combat lagginess but nothing that will discourage me from playing cause i'm sure it will get fixed. Overall great game. You guys are doing a good job with your release and i'm really looking forward to seeing where the game goes from here."
1	Damn good
1	No items found simulator. 10/10
1	 and was killed while pooing. 10/10"
1	 respawn on sqad go back to pick up my stuff get shot in face by squad becouse i didnt say it`s me running there.  10/10  fun times :)"
-1	Laggy mess with no content just wait for updates
1	 SCUM is an entirely different tale. I'll be holding onto SCUM and will be enjoying the crap of it!"
1	Hoping servers will be fixed so gun fights wont be as laggy. If you like DayZ youll love Scum just a better verison and better experience than DayZ.
1	 survival in this game is not just another ""Must say that we have this in the game"". It's a vast spectrum of parameteres  that influence your charcater. If you are looking for a solid survival game  SCUM is for you."
1	Clean and Crisp survival/PVP game. Dayz meets ARK.
1	thumbs up
-1	 and are being worked on already.Will update this review after a few patches! Fully expecting that this game will become good."
1	realistic being fat and shi.tting simulator 10/10 plus good vomit and p.iss sound effects 12/9very good fun having diarrhoea if u eat to much shi.t food
1	 zombiesInteresting region (Croatia!) who wasn't sick of USA / Russia settings?Clothing layers and craftingCons:Horrible FPS for many players with mid-end rigsRubberbandingDisconnectionsPerhaps a bit too big map for 64 players? Met only 2 guys in 3 hours of city-scavenging"
1	 the games been out for 3 days and the devs have already released 3 updates to fix some of the game breaking bugs. This game has amazing potential!"
1	Gun gameplay needs working on a little bit other then that the game is awesome!!!!!!
1	 awesome devs!"
1	 128ppl servers."
-1	Very unstable in it's current form. It has potential but I think this was released too early into early access. Perhaps the funds raised through early access can speed up development.
-1	 they are always quick to remind me."
1	Game needs a lot of work and love but its a solid foundation for the devs to build on.You like long walks in the forest with your friends and no action happening for hours?Like running for 20 minutes only to get one-tapped by a mech?Over all survival fan? Then you will like this game.
1	 if you win or do well you recieve more fame. Use fame to help aid your avatar back in the survival portion of the game.  pros:Great early access release. Devs that care and cummunicate. Large map lots to explore including underground bunkers and military bases. in depth charachter customization. only 22$ most weapons are throwable layered clothing dont mess with the  bears  (they look great and move fast)cons:no transportation (coming soon)no where to safely stash your gear. You can build a box but it has its risks (building fortifications are coming soon)"
1	 Dayz killer... brings back good memeories..."
1	Complex game! It's better than actual dayz.
1	 game worth  buying."
-1	Well.. I guess it dosnt work
1	game is amazing keep up the good work guys
1	 etc.) but that's to be expected at this point. Overall I give this game a 7.5/10. I really do hope things progress nicely for this game as it has incredible potential."
1	 and it is very fun to play"
-1	I want my money back.
1	 the game will never be what you have built it up or imagined it to be. it's a toxic way of thinking. especially when the game is in it's Infancy as an Early Access title. it's a f'n game for chrissakes. have fun with it. and leave it at that."
1	Scum literally just came out and people are already giving crap reviews....  Give it a chance there are so many things that the devs could do to make the game better and guess what?  The Devs will make it better...  Remember they want this game to succeed as much(maybe even more) than we do.  Ive only played Scum for 47 minutes so far and I can see the potential.
-1	im just disappointed
1	 these settings would be a plus one!"
1	i hate the little camera that finds you. other than that great survival game.
-1	 EXTREMELY TOXIC community on these servers."
-1	10/10 wipe simulatorwas 150 points from fame 1000 and lone behold wipe why bother playing this game to wiped everyday... there is none has insane potential but for now i would give it a miss if your gunna be triggered by wipes like me
1	A really good game if you are looking for something like DayZ with good devs. There are some problems and bugs but the devs are very active and trying their best to fix them and its Early Access.  GET IT FOR 20$ WHILST YOU STILL CAN.
1	Amazing game so far really like the hardcore survival aspect to it i just dislike the pvp junkies that constantly sprints wasting all their precious calories and energy so they can quote get sum pvp action. game is a Masterpeice keep adding pve aspects please.
1	 I reccomend this if you have some money to spare!"
1	Nice game!
-1	sinoc kupio igricu i ne mogu igrati on line jer nema moje verzije sta je to
1	 you have to think about what youre doing and time your movements. Zombies are buggy and are basically smaller gun-less robots.The crafting is very nice and can be built upon.Only found the same 5-ish guns.Can get laggy at points.I think its a good game and would warrent at its current state a 7/10. 07/09/18"
1	 I'm really enjoying this game so far and I really hope it gets less shallow. I can only walk around the woods and towns for so long without true purpose. Thumbs up"
1	 this game is for you.It's price point is more than fair. Dont expect a fast paced PUBG type of game. Very immersive game with hilarious encounters that is well backed by its responsive devs.Best buy in a while for me!"
1	 I can see this game having a really bright future."
1	 IMO. I love the crafting of items and searching around for that one last thing you need to do something else."
1	 im not a care bear that needs them nerfed i want them strong."
1	 know what you're getting into."
1	This game is so sick! proper real DEVs going hard at a game! u can feel the support! this game just getting bettter every day!
1	 just waiting for the servers to be fixed and add vehicles lol"
1	 an actual sandbox survival that runs decent with minimal bugs and still in early access.You can physically deficate on the souls of your defeated enemies with the push of a button.  10/10    Would poop again."
1	 everything you looked for in DayZ is in this game right here! give it a try you shall fall in love if you like pvp / hunger games type feel. !RECOMMENDED! See you all in the clink."
1	Lacking a few features that others have but without a doubt the best survival game I've played. Get it
1	It looks like a good game but it's the HARDEST GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS... MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 5.
-1	TAB key does not work... cant pee... cant poop... kinda frustrating...
1	Best DayZ since DayZ came out
-1	They refused to refund the game. I dont not wanna play this white supremist sh*t. Now I'm stuck with this trash.
1	 it has so much potential with Devs who are active and interact often with the community and take their feedback into account. I'm really looking forward to the story missions implementation as I have always believed a good Survival game should have things more than players locked into an unending battle over fame and resources."
-1	 basically once you have a gun and good loot there is nothing to do but run around looking for people who are worse off than you. There is no way to win anything but periodic satisfaction after destroying the occasional zombie horde. On top of it all this game performs so poorly on my system that even the menu gave me 30fps. If this was a beta and not a $20.00 Game my review would be more forgiving. However in it's current state this is worth no more than $5.00."
1	Very nice game. Only problem is the lag on populated servers. If you are on a 20 people server its fine. but at like 40-50+ everyone starts lagging. but good game overall very detailed.
1	 and both crafting and inventory use are not very intuitive.  The management aspect is where you have many choices...  Place an item directly on to a table/shelf/floor from the inv. window and vis versa. Performance will vary.  Those with with new CPUs and GTX 1070s or higher will see 60fps on average @ epic preset.  The only Unreal engine based ea release that actually performs well IMO.  Ark still has horrible fps years later and I'm getting 70+ in SCUM."
-1	Won't let me fire my fully loaded gun.
1	big openworld zombie SURVIVAL game :) love it > im looking forwart to more content > if anyone need some painkillers... im ur dealer :D
1	 but if you want a smooth non-rubber banding experience wait a few months"
1	 but they are not much compared to other games in that state. The devs seem to be good and I have hope they will really end up releasing one of the  best survival games out there. Note: Buy only if you have patience because there is still a lot to be improved in the game."
-1	How did you find a way to make the controls as bad as dayz?
1	 my big problem is fighting the zombies with melee. Its ridiculous lol but the game is so fun. I just dread going to towns or being spotted by zombies."
1	 active devs alsoAnd so far im having fun cant wait for more items and things to be added!"
-1	Bad optimization and extremely boring Game.
1	 this could be one of the great ."
1	 something quite rare for early access games. Though the game's survival formula can be a bit bland at times I hope that it can come into it's own somewhere down the line. Definitely worth the price or at least to keep an eye on."
1	 especially for this price.my friends call it ""day-z with working mechanics"" but i never played Day z myself."
1	 dont allow ne bases just make the houses available for base building..."
1	The game definitely has potential with more content updates and if the devs dont let the game die it has the chances of being a great game. It is in early acces at the moment so when thinking of buying it dont go in with huge expectations and tinking it'll have lots of content. It can feel very bare bones at times on your own so I recommend finding someone to play with. All in all though I have enjoyed the game so far and im excited to see where the game will go with time.
1	waiting on updates...
1	 which helped me survive. Great game both for chilled survival-sightseeing and scummy PVP."
1	My favorite Battle Royale at the moment
1	 that ur clothing isn't wet."
-1	RUN!BLEED!DIE!and cycle goes on.....
-1	 lost about 17 hrs of gameplay in 1 server just to switch to another.You can still play in EU/US server if you don't mind the ping tho."
-1	 but it's another case of releasing TOO early..."
1	camping air field simulator 11/10 would camp again
-1	 not a fun game.Well unless you like starting over every few hours and never making progress in the game."
1	"Let me tell you about my experience with scum.                 Here is my scummy story As me and my 2 friends met up after a lonely lord of the rings journey from across the map we couldnt be more happy to have met up with eachother at the farm in the middle of no where. My two friends found an egg each to eat. I did not. This egg was discovered to have a magical bug that made it never disappear. (Now fixed) for 3 hours every time my buddys ate this magical egg I had to hear about how amazing it was. How lucky they are. How I'm a piece of s**** because I dont have a magical egg.... as I'm sure you can tell.... man was I sad. But i realized right before we decided to clear out some zombies in front of a town. Wait.... this is a survival simulator. Eating an egg constantly for hours cant be good for your health... "" hey boys.... the egg is cool and all but you may want to check your stats"" (zombies getting closer) friend 1 ""omg my sodium level is 1000%""Friend 2 ""wait mine is to!"" (Zombies attack) As we fight the lighting fast 5ft leaping zombies I watched as my 2 friends were forced to stop swinging there melee weapons.... pull down there pants.... and spray diareahha while zombies pummeled them.... LITTERALLY SPRAYING liquid s**** with force out of there a**. Never have I seen anything like this in my life. We all died laughing... and I mean actually died in game.  The moral of the story is. First off.... dont only eat eggs. You will s*** yourself. Second is yes in EA there is bugs. Some more annoying then others. But the dev's pump the patches out. And this game is what you make it. Go out. Go on an adventure. And let game unfold. Its 100% worth the money just for watching my a**hole friends crap there pants. Give it a buy. Well done devs. This is what us survival folks really needed. And bravo on implementing legitamit diareahha."
1	 I am only running a 4690K with a RX480 8GB and I get a solid 60 in most towns in some places I even reach a solid 90 and if it does drop down to 45 it stil feels perfectly playable."
-1	nah
1	 this game is headed in a good direction."
-1	 but it is just horrible at this state. Refund if you can..."
1	Still extremely early but this game already runs pretty smoothly and the potential is huge
1	 game seems great could just use some work get its early access but fix it fast or end up like H1Z1."
1	 AND PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CRAFT BANDAGES . THANKS FOR READING"
1	 hard learning curve. Its like a Harder DayZ. My PC Just can't handle it."
-1	 I got bored and couldn't see myself actively playing this over other games right now. So I requested a refund and re-added the game to my wishlist to track its future progress down the road."
1	 patches almost every day"
1	Amazing game with amazing developers. :)
-1	It lags to damn much on my ROG Gaming Laptop. Wait some months when they optimize it and then buy. Do not support Early Access.
1	 pvp in this game is bad 1/10. People teleporting all around( dsync and etc)."
1	 it's just not worth buying right now until they have some basic cheater mitigations in place."
1	 i found myself having so many meds that i tripped up to be a pharmacy worker :D20$ is too low price for game such as this masterpiece. Thank you Croteam."
1	 god lord that zombie fat tastes so good :)"
1	Lots of fun with very deep survival mecanics.
1	 this was bound to be amazing from the start!"
1	 it still needs alot of work."
-1	 there is fps drop and the community is already toxic."
1	 big fan now.Nelson"
1	This game is already 10x better than DayZ. the aiming is very smooth. although i do have 2 compaints 1. the game crashed a few times but thats not that big of a deal and 2. the mechs that patrole high loot areas. they have god aim and shot me through a wall at one point so that sucks. but overall i say this game is worth it
1	You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry  You are hungry
1	for a early access game every thing is fine but realy item spawning system is bad whe need more guns on map i can't kill a player whit a wooden spear :|
-1	 if dead go to point number 2.) - Wait for the hacker that spawns on you over an over again with all kinds of weapons (will happed just wait) - Die after his 5th attempt of killin you - Uninstall the game in hope things will change sometime."
1	DayZ killer
1	gameplay is great while this game still ea and have that optimize atleast better than other ea game
1	I think the game is very fun But there are many bugs During the game I fell under the texture I think it's missing content and there's a problem with the zombies you can bend over the zombies could not hurt you is not understandable how to get medics there is no use of the Services function I understand that the game is in the development stage and everything but in general the game is very fun very big map lots of places and more !Swim problam !
-1	Chinese As We Need.
1	lacking content. crafting is insanely slow and hard to understandeven the forest is easier and that game is so grindy it makes me wanna sing along to R Kelly's bump and grind. This game has loads of potential but i don't feel its at that stage where i want to invest my free time to it just yet.Adding a tutorial system would definitely help players to get a grasp on the game as I honestly was just trying to get some loot but to what purpose?? What is the goal? I recommend this game but not for now. Add more content and I'll be glad to revisit it again some day
1	 i hope the cons will get fixed but im sure they will!"
1	 the game is a lot of fun from what i've experienced of it's Single Player Mode.I definitely suggest it if you don't mind a game that came out just this week that'll likely be patched like mad over the next month to improve it."
-1	run for minutes no zombies no players and lot of lag not worth it atm
1	very fun game... waiting for it to be 100% to be perfect
-1	Pretty much like any other open world zombie survival game but with a few more details. Not much else to say.
1	 please change this so you don't lose all the gear. Can take so long to find guns and ammo just to lose it all when some bastard mech shoots through a tin wall (game bug) and kills you. I will recommend this game on the hope we will retain our loot as it really sucks having to start all over again."
-1	booooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiiiiiiiing after a while
1	 best best BB"
1	I CANT EVEN PLAY IT DOESSNT SHOW ANY SERVERS I REFRESH NOTTING HAPPENS WASTE OF MONEY
1	 they just need to fix the damn controls for azerty players.. i cant use the damn quickslot menu so i die alot because i cant take out my knife fast enough or a gun... please fix this :)"
1	 all around perfect launch."
1	Time consuming and immersive.  Beautifull und exciting.Funny and savage.
1	 just need to hang in there guys."
1	Well worth $20
1	Amazing game with amazing graphics! I would recommend. Some on and off lag whilst playing but it doesn't effect the game too much. Good bang for your buck!
1	 and robots has me hooked.Daily loot runs are always unpredictable.Being prepared can be the difference between life and death.WELCOME TO SCUM #SCUMMITUP"
1	BEST
1	 haven't tried it myself but heard from everyone that it's a great way to learn the weapons in the game and have fun."
1	i take back what i said because they fixed a lot of stuff within a hour made a small patch. its ran better since then and played for over a hour with not losing connection had a great time cant wait for new updates on stuff great game i love this game!
1	"There is new KING in the town! It's called ""SCUM"" and his older brother called DayZ can now die! Hahaha"
1	 heehee."
1	Awesome game.its looks cool and it is cool :D
-1	 and that would make this a really solid EA. Get vehicles in with a few more weapons and sights maybe and we have something real special."
-1	 and even bugging so you maybe end losing you character after using time playing.    It feels realy sad to try a survival game that is using character creating and survival system to make it the most realistic. and not even after few min fun. all my progressing was lost. and randomised.  I did have a weight on 71kg .  after the bug. i weight a little over 130kg and i got a total new face (skin texture)The game have Big potential . I wont ask for refund. I still belive in the game.  But some Changed and fixed need to be made before i will use my time on it."
1	The fact that you can poop on the people you kill is what sold me on this game 10/10
-1	 But its trash with the buff of robots its rage inducing and has ruined the game. Avoid for now"
-1	is ok
-1	 please"
-1	 so the ""Favorites"" tab is useless as well.Stay far away from this game until these issues have been adressed."
1	The next survival game!hope it will be good.
1	What Dayz wishes it was
1	whats up with the servers
-1	Server browser is from 1995ez refund
1	SCUM is a promising survival game which introduces lots of new mechanics for more realism. At first glance it may look similar to DayZ but imho it has a lot more depth and cool features. Try it out! 10/10 would recommend
1	 Im just here to battle the bad reviews an hour into launch."
1	 honestly im really enjoying this game right now the combat is fun the looting is what you would expect i cant wait to see what happens with this game in 1 months time."
-1	this should not be a early access in a few months in people arte not going to like it :(
-1	 its clear the comunity is hyped up so lets keep it going and get some objective markers on that map and please.. a story."
-1	Buyer aware!!!!!!This is garbage game!
-1	 no fun"
-1	Released to early!fed up of it after 2 hours of playingIts like the Forest!
1	 the lag issues and memory leakage thats casing a few issues are an easy fix same for the low levels of loot available at this stage... in round uplots of minor issues nothing major fantastic concept looking forward to playing the game as it grows to a completed game"
1	 the game needs some fixing but nothing major as far as Im concerned.Im playing with:i7700K OC to 4.8ghzGTX 980ti16gb of RAMI have everything set to the highest and I very rarely get lag. It pretty much runs smoothly at all times."
1	 this is a great starting point."
1	 asks more i guess) .... stay away from early .. wait till  its get polished and optimized.."
-1	 early access Dayz remake."
1	Very nice gamee. If u read this then fkn buy it!
-1	 the rest have been seen before."
1	best 20 dollars for a great survival game!!
1	 and should probably research what it means when games are in alpha."
-1	pretty boring tbh
-1	 you will probably have to find a clip to put the ammo in first so uhh. Good luck."
1	Has all it needs to be a Tripple A title. Mainly needs some work on the servers at the moment. But great potential when they add more stuff. 7/10 at release date. Not bad tho. Active devs. Keep it up.
1	So the game is good but some lag here and there not to bad.... They need to add more loot!! To many things out there that want to hurt you!!
